Investigation Title	Gene expression changes in response to the overexpression of the Arabidopsis RKD4 gene							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Gene expression changes in response to the overexpression of the Arabidopsis RKD4 gene							
Experiment Description	The Arabidopsis RWP-RK protein RKD4 is expressed specifically in early embryogenesis and triggers embryonic cell division sequences. We used Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays to analyze the pattern of gene expression changes in response to induced ectopic expression of RKD4 in post-embryonic organs. Plants of a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible overexpression line and a control line were grown under normal conditions for 2 days and then treated with DEX for 1 day. RNA was extracted from two independent pools for each genotype.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Hybridization, washing, and staining procedures were conducted with the Fluidics Station 450 as described in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix).	Sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were plated on a nutrient agar medium and grown at 23 ËšC with a 16h-light/8h-dark cycle.	The data were analyzed with Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) using default analysis settings.	The scanning procedure was conducted with the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G as described in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix).	Two days after germination, seedlings were transferred to a nutrient agar medium containing 1 microM of Dexamethasone (DEX).	For each replicate, RNA was extracted from 60 seedlings using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) accrding to the manufacturer's protocol.	Biotin-labelled cRNA was prepared using the Affymetrix GeneChip 3' IVT Expression Kit.
