Early responses to neighbors seem to be assoctaed with touch, not light signalling. We studied gene expression in petioles during early canopy development when leaf hyponasty was visible but altered phytochrome signalling was not yet detectable. Plants were grown in small pots that were either kept single, or put in a high density of 2066 plants\/m2. Gene expression measured in petioles when canopies had reached a leaf area index of 0.9."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Ronald Pierik","role":"submitter","email":"r.pierik@uu.nl"},{"contact":"Mieke de Wit","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Ronald Pierik","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":22908260,"authors":"de Wit M, Kegge W, Evers JB, Vergeer-van Eijk MH, Gankema P, Voesenek LA, Pierik R","title":"Plant neighbor detection through touching leaf tips precedes phytochrome signals.","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1205437109"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["petiole"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":634252,"accession":"P-GSE39010-8"},{"id":634254,"accession":"P-GSE39010-7"},{"id":634251,"accession":"P-GSE39010-2"},{"id":634247,"accession":"P-GSE39010-1"},{"id":634250,"accession":"P-GSE39010-4"},{"id":634253,"accession":"P-GSE39010-3"},{"id":634248,"accession":"P-GSE39010-6"},{"id":634249,"accession":"P-GSE39010-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
