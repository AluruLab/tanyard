Chory, Salk Institute, San Diego, CA. These accessions can also be obtained from NASC (",{"a":{"href":"http:\/\/arabidopsis.info","target":"_blank","$":"http:\/\/arabidopsis.info"}},") and TAIR (www.arabidopsis.org).  A factorial experiment was conducted with three biological replicates of the seven accessions. The replications were performed on 3 different dates per accession, due to space limitations in the growth chambers. For each biological replicate, multiple plants (~30) per accession were grown in a growth chamber under short day conditions (8 hr light at 100-120 microEinsteins, 20 degrees C day\/20 degrees C night) to maintain plants in the vegetative phase for six to seven weeks.  The growth chambers used a combination of metal halide, mercury vapor, and incandescent lamps.  Plants were watered with half-strength Hoagland’s solution.  SA and\/or Silwet treatment. Plants with 25 to 30 rosette leaves (rosette diameter 60 to 70 mm) were selected and sprayed with 0.30 mM SA (salicylic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)  in 0.02% Silwet L77 to run-off, and control plants were sprayed with 0.02% Silwet L77, a surfactant (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX, USA), alone.

Plants with 25 to 30 rosette leaves (rosette diameter 60 to 70 mm) were selected and sprayed with 0.30 mM SA (salicylic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)  in 0.02% Silwet L77 to run-off, and control plants were sprayed with 0.02% Silwet L77, a surfactant (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX, USA), alone. 5 - 6 week old vegetative leaves from plants from each combination of accession and treatment were harvested at 4, 28, and 52 hours post-treatment, and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extractions. Three plants per accession were bulked for each concentration\/time point. Each plant was harvested only once. To avoid diurnal variation in gene expression, the time points were 24 hrs apart and harvesting was always performed over a 30 minute period at the same time of day (1:00 PM)."],"type":"growth protocol","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":92275,"accession":"P-TABM-103","name":"P-TABM-103","text":"RNA was extracted from the bulked plants using TRIzol as per the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by purification on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).","type":"nucleic acid extraction protocol","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0},{"id":766750,"accession":"P-TABM-104","name":"P-TABM-104","text":"cDNA and labeled cRNA was prepared according to the manufacturer’s guidelines in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual 701021 rev1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
