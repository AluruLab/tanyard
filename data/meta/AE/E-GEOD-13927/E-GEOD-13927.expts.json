Crown gall development was induced on intact plants under most natural conditions with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Differential gene expression and the metabolite pattern was determined by comparing crown galls with mock-inoculated inflorescence stalk segments of the same age. Experiment Overall Design: The bases of Arabidopsis thaliana (WS-2) inflorescence stalks were wounded and immediately inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens, strain C58, or mock-inoculated. Plants were cultivated for another 35 days under short day conditions (8 h illumination, 16 h darkness). Gene expression values of four independent experiments of treated material (C58 35dpi 1 to 4) were compared with four non-treated samples of the same age (reference 35dpi 1 to 4). Differential gene expression was analyzed by applying the LIMMA package (Linear Models for Microarray Data; Smyth, G.K. (2004) Applic. Genet. Mol.
