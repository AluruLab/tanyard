Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data of QK mutant and wild type of Arabidopsis after heat shock							
Experiment Description	In order to study the importance of HSFA1 in thermotolerance in Arabidopsis, we generated the HSFA1a, b, d and e quadruple mutant (QK). QK is very sensitive to heat. Therefore, we used microarray to study how many genes regulated by HSFA1 after heat shock. Seven-day-old seedlings of Col-0, Ws and QK grown at 22oC on 0.5x MS plates containing 1% sucrose were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, samples were collected for RNA extraction. The experiment was repeated, and two biological replicates were processed for analysis.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix® GeneChip® Fluidics Station 450.	Col-0, Ws and QK were grown at 22°C on 0.5x MS plates containing 1% sucrose for 7 days.	The data were analyzed with GeneChip Operation System 1.4 (GCOS 1.4) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip® Scanner 3000.	Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C then collected for RNA extraction.	Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
