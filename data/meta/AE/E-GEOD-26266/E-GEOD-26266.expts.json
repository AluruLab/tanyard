QK is very sensitive to heat. Therefore, we used microarray to study how many genes regulated by HSFA1 after heat shock. Seven-day-old seedlings of Col-0, Ws and QK grown at 22oC on 0.5x MS plates containing 1% sucrose were incubated for 1 h at 37 Â°C. Subsequently, samples were collected for RNA extraction. The experiment was repeated, and two biological replicates were processed for analysis."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Yee-yung Charng","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Hsiang-chin Liu","role":"submitter","email":"liuaway@gmail.com"},{"contact":"Hsiang-chin Liu","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21241330,"authors":"Liu HC, Liao HT, Charng YY.","title":"The role of class A1 heat shock factors (HSFA1s) in response to heat and other stresses in Arabidopsis","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-3040.2011.02278.x","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["7 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["Col-0","QK mutant","Ws"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["Col-0","QK mutant","Ws"]},{"name":"TREATMENT","value":["heat shocked","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":443002,"accession":"P-GSE26266-1"},{"id":443004,"accession":"P-GSE26266-5"},{"id":443006,"accession":"P-GSE26266-4"},{"id":443009,"accession":"P-GSE26266-3"},{"id":443007,"accession":"P-GSE26266-2"},{"id":443005,"accession":"P-GSE26266-8"},{"id":443003,"accession":"P-GSE26266-7"},{"id":443008,"accession":"P-GSE26266-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
