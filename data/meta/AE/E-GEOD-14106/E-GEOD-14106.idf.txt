Experiment Description	The intention of these gene expression analysis was to study host responses to an infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens at different stages of crown gall development. Therefore the transcriptome of infected inflorescence stalk tissue and mature crown galls of Arabidopsis thaliana (WS-2) was determined of three different time points. These were compared with the transcriptome of mock-infected inflorescence stalk tissue (reference) of the same age. The following time points were analyzed: (i) three hours post inoculation, before the T-DNA is integrated into the host genome (ii) six days after inoculation when the T-DNA is present in the nucleus and the oncogenes are expressed in the host cell, and (iii) 35 days after inoculation when a mature tumors has developed. For the three-hour- (3hpi) and six-day- time point (6dpi) plants were infected with the virulent strain C58, harboring a T-DNA, or with strain GV3101, containing a disarmed Ti-plasmid. This allows discrimination between signals which derive from the bacterial pathogen and the T-DNA encoded oncogenes.  This SuperSeries is composed of the following subset Series:; GSE13929: Arabidopsis thaliana three hours after infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens; GSE13930: Arabidopsis thaliana six days after infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens; GSE13927: Transcriptome of mature A. thaliana crown galls. Experiment Overall Design: Refer to individual Series

Protocol Description	The base of the first emerging main inflorescence stalk (3-5 cm) of intact plants was wounded with a syringe needle, mock-inoculated and grown for another three hours.	The base of the first emerging main inflorescence stalks (3-5 cm) of an intact plant was wounded with a syringe needle, mock-inoculated and grown for another 35 days.	The base of the first emerging main inflorescence stalk (3-5 cm) of intact plants was wounded with a syringe needle and inoculated with A. tumefaciens strain GV3101. Agrobacteria were scratched from the surface of an agar plate with a bent pipette tip by preventing contamination with medium and evenly spread on the wounded inflorescence stalk area immediately after wounding. Inoculated plants were grown for another three hours.
