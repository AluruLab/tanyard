Therefore the transcriptome of infected inflorescence stalk tissue and mature crown galls of Arabidopsis thaliana (WS-2) was determined of three different time points. These were compared with the transcriptome of mock-infected inflorescence stalk tissue (reference) of the same age. The following time points were analyzed: (i) three hours post inoculation, before the T-DNA is integrated into the host genome (ii) six days after inoculation when the T-DNA is present in the nucleus and the oncogenes are expressed in the host cell, and (iii) 35 days after inoculation when a mature tumors has developed. For the three-hour- (3hpi) and six-day- time point (6dpi) plants were infected with the virulent strain C58, harboring a T-DNA, or with strain GV3101, containing a disarmed Ti-plasmid. This allows discrimination between signals which derive from the bacterial pathogen and the T-DNA encoded oncogenes.  This SuperSeries is composed of the following subset Series:; GSE13929: Arabidopsis thaliana three hours after infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens; GSE13930: Arabidopsis thaliana six days after infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens; GSE13927: Transcriptome of mature A. thaliana crown galls.
