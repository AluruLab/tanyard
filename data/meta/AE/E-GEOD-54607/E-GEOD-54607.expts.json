Samples were obtained from three independent experiments, and both genotypes were grown on the same plate. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground with a Retsch machine and 3-mm metal balls. RNA was extracted with TriZol (Invitrogen) and further purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNA digestion was done on columns with RNase-free DNase I (Roche). One µg of pure RNA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays at the VIB Microarray Facility (Leuven, Belgium)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Dirk Inzé","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Hannes Claeys","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Hannes Claeys","role":"submitter","email":"hacla@psb.vib-ugent.be"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["Boyes key 1.03"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["35S::KLU","wild type genotype"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["shoot"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["35S::KLU","wild type genotype"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1128674,"accession":"P-GSE54607-1"},{"id":1128675,"accession":"P-GSE54607-7"},{"id":1128676,"accession":"P-GSE54607-6"},{"id":1128677,"accession":"P-GSE54607-5"},{"id":1128678,"accession":"P-GSE54607-4"},{"id":1128680,"accession":"P-GSE54607-3"},{"id":1128679,"accession":"P-GSE54607-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
