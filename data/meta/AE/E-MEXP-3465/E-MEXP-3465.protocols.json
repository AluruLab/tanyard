Seeds were sown on filter paper placed above 0.5X MS 0.8% agar media plates and imbibed for five days at 4 degrees C. To minimize the effects of biological variation, we followed a pooling strategy after Zhu et al. (2003) in which approximately 100 individual plants per replicate experiment were harvested and pooled before RNA extraction and hybridization. The seedlings were then transferred to 20 degrees C for five days. Shoot tissue from seedlings were collected for RNA isolation (Day 5). The remaining seedlings on the filter paper were transferred to either MS plates consisting of 1 ﾵM DEX or the same amount of DMSO. Two and four days after the transfer, shoot tissue was collected from seedlings to obtain RNA samples for Day 7 and Day 9, respectively.
