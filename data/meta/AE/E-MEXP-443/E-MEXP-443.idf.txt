Experiment Description	Aim of the experiment is the identification of regulatory genes rapidly induced by low R/FR and still up-regulated after prolonged exposure to FR-rich light. To this end, gene expression changes were analysed in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings after exposure to low R/FR light for a short and a long period of time. The experiment was designed to enable comparison between treated and untreated Arabidopsis seedlings.

Protocol Description	Seedlings were grown in a growth chamber (E30-LED, Percival Scientific Inc., USA), at 21°C temperature, 75% humidity, 16 h light/8 h dark cycles.	Arabidopsis seedlings were exposed to high R/FR light and then to low R/FR light for a short and a long period of time. Light outputs in high R/FR were: 670 nm (Red) 96 mmoles m-2s-1; 735 nm (Far Red,) 21 mmoles m-2s-1; 470 nm (Blue) 15 mmoles m-2s-1. Light outputs in low R/FR were: 670 nm, 12 mmoles m-2s-1; 735 nm, 105 mmoles m-2s-1; 470 nm, 15 mmoles m-2s-1. 8-day-old seedlings were harvested after the exposure to low R/FR light for 1 hour and 4 days. As a control, 8-day-old seedlings grown for the entire period in high R/FR light were harvested.	Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Each sample consists of a pool of 200 individuals. Two sets of samples were collected from independent experiments.	7 µg of total RNA was used in a reverse transcription reaction (SuperScript II; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) to generate first-strand cDNA. After second-strand synthesis, double-strand cDNA was used in an in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction to generate biotinylated cRNA (ENZO BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit; ENZO Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). Size distribution of the cRNA and fragmented cRNA, respectively, was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with a RNA 6000 Nano Assay.	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol.
