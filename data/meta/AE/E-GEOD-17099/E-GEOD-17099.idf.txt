Experiment Description	HRE1 and HRE2 are two ERF transcription factors induced by low oxygen. In this work we analyzed the effect of ectopic expression of HRE1 and HRE2 on the arabidopsis transcriptome in aerobic and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. While HRE1 has a moderate effect on the expression of anaerobic genes under hypoxia, HRE2 does not affect them either under aerobic or hypoxic conditions. Experiment Overall Design: We treated Arabidopsis seedling Col-0 (wt) and transgenic 35S::HRE1 and 35S::HRE2 , 7-day old, germinated in 12/12 light/dark photoperiod with: Experiment Overall Design: -Control (23Â°C, dark, 21% O2, 4h). Experiment Overall Design: -Hypoxia (23Â°C, dark, 1% O2, 4h). Experiment Overall Design: Two biological replicates for each condition.

Protocol Description	This sample represents aerobic transgenic 35S::HRE1. Arabidopsis seedlings, 7d-old.	This sample represents hypoxic transgenic 35S::HRE2. Arabidopsis seedlings, 7d-old.	This sample represents aerobic transgenic 35S::HRE2. Arabidopsis seedlings, 7d-old.	This sample represents aerobic wt Col-0. Arabidopsis seedlings, 7d-old.	This sample represents hypoxic 35S::HRE1 Col-0. Arabidopsis seedlings, 7d-old.	This sample represents hypoxic wt Col-0. Arabidopsis seedlings, 7d-old.	Arabidopsis thaliana, Columbia-0 ecotype, was used in all experiments. Seeds were sterilized with ethanol 70% (1 min),  0.85% sodium hypochlorite (10 min) and rinsed with sterile water (6 times). Seedlings were grown on  Murashige and Skoog half-strength medium (agar 0.8%) containing 30 mM sucrose. The plates were incubated in the dark at 4Â°C for two days (vernalization, to promote homogeneous germination) and then transferred to 23Â°C for seven days under light/dark 12/12 photoperiod before the treatments. Seedlings were grown under aerobic conditions.	Arabidopsis thaliana, Columbia-0 ecotype, was used in all experiments.
