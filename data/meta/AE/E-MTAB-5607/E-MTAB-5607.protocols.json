Afterwards, the nematode-water mixture was briefly centrifuged at 800 rpm for 2 minutes. The supernatant was removed to a new Eppendorf tube and was labelled as NemaWater. All steps of NemaWater production were performed under sterile conditions. Twelve-day-old Arabidopsis plants grown in Knop medium, as described above, were removed from agar plates and incubated in NemaWater for one hour each. Whole roots from 10 plants were cut and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Arabidopsis roots treated only with dd H2O were used as a control.","type":"treatment protocol","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1241144,"accession":"P-MTAB-54753","name":null,"text":"RNA was extracted using a Nucleospin RNA extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel, Durren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
