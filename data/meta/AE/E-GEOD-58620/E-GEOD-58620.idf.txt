Investigation Title	Expression data from Arabidopsis seedlings heat-stressed in dark environment						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis seedlings heat-stressed in dark environment
Experiment Description	Plants transcriptome react to environment temperature changes profoundly. In Arabidopsis seedlings, genes respond to temperature fluctuations to adopt the ever-changing ambient environment. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying heat stress response progress in Arabidopsis. Ten-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to explore the heat stress response in transcriptome, thus we treat the plants with heat stress.  While in order to identify the interaction between light and temperature signaling pathways in plant , we treat Arabidopsis with heat stress under both light and dark conditions. To that end, our plant tissues are grouped as: HS-LIGHT, HS-DARK,CONTROL-LIGHT,CONTROL-DARK.

Protocol Name	P-GSE58620-1	P-GSE58620-5	P-GSE58620-6	P-GSE58620-2	P-GSE58620-3	P-GSE58620-4	P-GSE58620-7
Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) algorithm using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 RMA signal intensity	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol.	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	for HS groups, the treatment was 37â„ƒ for 30min	Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants of ecotype Col-0 were used for all experiments. Sterilized seeds were grown in Murashige & Skoog solid medium within glass plates. After a 72 h vernalization at 4â„ƒ in dark condition, plats were transferred to the growth camber (ambient temperature of 23â„ƒ, relative humidity of approximately 70%, and a photoperiod of 16 h light approximately 100 Î¼mol m-2s-1 alternating with 8 h darkness).	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	GeneChips were scanned by using Affymetrix® GeneChip Command Console (AGCC) which installed in GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G.
