In Arabidopsis seedlings, genes respond to temperature fluctuations to adopt the ever-changing ambient environment. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying heat stress response progress in Arabidopsis. Ten-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to explore the heat stress response in transcriptome, thus we treat the plants with heat stress.  While in order to identify the interaction between light and temperature signaling pathways in plant , we treat Arabidopsis with heat stress under both light and dark conditions. To that end, our plant tissues are grouped as: HS-LIGHT, HS-DARK,CONTROL-LIGHT,CONTROL-DARK."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Junyi Song","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Junyi Song","role":"submitter","email":"283693514@qq.com"},{"contact":"Biru Hu","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"cultivar","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["16-day-old seedlings","17-day-old seedlings","18-day-old seedlings","19-day-old seedlings","20-day-old seedlings","21-day-old seedlings"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE","value":["16-day-old seedlings","17-day-old seedlings","18-day-old seedlings","19-day-old seedlings","20-day-old seedlings","21-day-old seedlings"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1038646,"accession":"P-GSE58620-6"},{"id":1038647,"accession":"P-GSE58620-5"},{"id":1038645,"accession":"P-GSE58620-7"},{"id":1038648,"accession":"P-GSE58620-4"},{"id":1038649,"accession":"P-GSE58620-3"},{"id":1038650,"accession":"P-GSE58620-2"},{"id":1038644,"accession":"P-GSE58620-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
