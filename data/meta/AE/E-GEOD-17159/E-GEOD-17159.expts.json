During the initial dark-to-light transition, phy photoactivation induces rapid changes in gene expression that eventually lead to the photomorphogenic development. Recent reports indicate that this process is achieved by phy-induced degradation of Phy-Interacting bHLH transcription Factors (PIFs) PIF1, PIF3 PIF4 and PIF5, which are partly redundant constitutive repressors of photomorphogenesis that accumulate in darkness. In order to test whether light\/phy-regulated gene expression occurs through these PIFs, we have performed whole-genome expression analysis in the pif1pif3pif4pif5 quadruple mutant (pifq).  Wild-type and pifq mutant seeds were plated on GM medium without sucrose at room temperature. During this procedure the seeds were routinely exposed to white light (WL) for a total of 1.5 hours after imbibition. Seeds were then stratified for 5 days at 4ºC in darkness, induced to germinate with a 5-min red pulse (Rp) (46 μmol\/m2\/s) and then incubated in the dark for 3h at 21°C before exposure to a terminal 5-min far red pulse (FRp) (58 μmol\/m2\/s) to suppress pseudo-dark effects. Seeds were then placed in either dark (D) or constant red light (Rc) (6.7 μmol\/ m2\/s) at 21°C for 45h (2d-old seedlings). Alternatively, 2d-old dark-grown seedlings were treated with 1h of red light (R1) (7.5 μmol\/m2\/s). Seed samples were harvested after stratification (5d stratified seeds)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Pablo Leivar","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"James M Tepperman","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"james m tepperman","role":"submitter","email":"jmtepp@berkeley.edu"},{"contact":"Peter H Quail","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19920208,"authors":"Leivar P, Tepperman JM, Monte E, Calderon RH, Liu TL, Quail PH","title":"Definition of early transcriptional circuitry involved in light-induced reversal of PIF-imposed repression of photomorphogenesis in young Arabidopsis seedlings.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seed","seedling"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["pif1pif3pif4pif5 (pifq) mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"developmental stage","value":["seed","seedling"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["pif1pif3pif4pif5 (pifq) mutant","wild type"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["darkness","darkness followed by 1 hour red light","red light","stratification"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":30,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1132804,"accession":"P-GSE17159-24"},{"id":1132805,"accession":"P-GSE17159-23"},{"id":1132799,"accession":"P-GSE17159-26"},{"id":1132800,"accession":"P-GSE17159-25"},{"id":1132807,"accession":"P-GSE17159-20"},{"id":1132812,"accession":"P-GSE17159-9"},{"id":1132803,"accession":"P-GSE17159-22"},{"id":1132808,"accession":"P-GSE17159-21"},{"id":1132814,"accession":"P-GSE17159-16"},{"id":1132815,"accession":"P-GSE17159-17"},{"id":1132802,"accession":"P-GSE17159-18"},{"id":1132801,"accession":"P-GSE17159-19"},{"id":1132816,"accession":"P-GSE17159-15"},{"id":1132818,"accession":"P-GSE17159-14"},{"id":1132817,"accession":"P-GSE17159-13"},{"id":1132806,"accession":"P-GSE17159-12"},{"id":1132813,"accession":"P-GSE17159-11"},{"id":1132811,"accession":"P-GSE17159-10"},{"id":1132798,"accession":"P-GSE17159-4"},{"id":1132810,"accession":"P-GSE17159-3"},{"id":1132809,"accession":"P-GSE17159-2"},{"id":1132793,"accession":"P-GSE17159-1"},{"id":1132794,"accession":"P-GSE17159-8"},{"id":1132795,"accession":"P-GSE17159-7"},{"id":1132796,"accession":"P-GSE17159-6"},{"id":1132797,"accession":"P-GSE17159-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":30,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":30,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":30,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":30,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":30,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":30,"isderived":0}]}]}}
