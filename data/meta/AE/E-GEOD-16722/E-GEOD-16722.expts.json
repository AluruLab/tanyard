Results show the central role of PHR1 and functionally redundant members of its family in the control of transcriptional responses to Pi starvation. The analysis was performed in wild-type plants grown for seven days in complete (+Pi) and Pi-lacking (-Pi) Johnson solid media and the single phr1 and double phr1-phl1 mutants grown for 7 days in –Pi medium. Three independent biological samples of total RNA from shoot and root were hybridized separately."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Regla Bustos","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Javier Paz-Ares","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Gabriel Castrillo","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Regla Bustos","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20838596,"authors":"Bustos R, Castrillo G, Linhares F, Puga MI, Rubio V, Pérez-Pérez J, Solano R, Leyva A, Paz-Ares J","title":"A central regulatory system largely controls transcriptional activation and repression responses to phosphate starvation in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.1001102","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["phr1 mutant","phr1; phl1 double mutant","wild type genotype"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root","shoot"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["phr1 mutant","phr1; phl1 double mutant","wild type genotype"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["control","phosphate deprivation"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["root","shoot"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":24,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1125210,"accession":"P-GSE16722-1"},{"id":1125215,"accession":"P-GSE16722-3"},{"id":1125216,"accession":"P-GSE16722-2"},{"id":1125213,"accession":"P-GSE16722-5"},{"id":1125214,"accession":"P-GSE16722-4"},{"id":1125211,"accession":"P-GSE16722-6"},{"id":1125212,"accession":"P-GSE16722-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":24,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":24,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":24,"isderived":0}]}]}}
