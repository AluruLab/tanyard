Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data in whole Arabidopsis seedlings after treatment with the herbicide dicamba							
Experiment Description	Dicamba is an auxin-like herbicide that can stimulate the production of ethylene and ABA biosynthesis.  The subsequent stomatal closure and build-up of reactive oxygen species is hypothesized to contribute to plant death. In order to further understand the herbicide dicamba's mode of action at the molecular level, we used microarrays to dissect global gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings 10 hrs after dicamba treatment. 4 day old Arabidopsis seedlings (a Columbia line containing a -800GSTF8::LUC reporter) were flooded with water or 7mM dicamba  for 40 minutes before the treatment was poured off.  Ten hours after the start of the treatment, whole seedlings were collected

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA  expression value (signal intensity)	cRNA was hybridized to the GeneChip® Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array using a Genechip instrument system with scanner 3000 7G and autoloader for expression array processing and analysis, following manufacturer's protocol.  Labeling, hybing and scanning were	WT (a Columbia line containing a -800GSTF8::LUC reporter) Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilzed and sown on MS-media plates.  Plates were vernalized 3 days at 4C in dark before being transferred to controlled growth room set at 21ºCwith a 16 hour ligh	The raw data files underwent background correction, normalization, probe specific correction, and summary value computation using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method in the Bioconductor package.  To find the differentially expressed genes we utilized the limma package for R to calculate the Log2 fold change, the moderate t-statistic, B value, and the adjusted p value (BenjaminiHochberg FDR) for each array probe.	Genechips were scanned Affymetrix GeneChip scanner 3000 7G	Plates were flooded with water or 7 mM dicamba (Cadence 0.325 g/mole, Syngenta) for 40 minutes.  The treatments were poured off and the plates incubated for an additional 9 hr 20 min at RT.	RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 2 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
