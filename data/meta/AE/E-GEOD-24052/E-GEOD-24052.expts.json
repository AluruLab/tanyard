The subsequent stomatal closure and build-up of reactive oxygen species is hypothesized to contribute to plant death. In order to further understand the herbicide dicamba's mode of action at the molecular level, we used microarrays to dissect global gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings 10 hrs after dicamba treatment. 4 day old Arabidopsis seedlings (a Columbia line containing a -800GSTF8::LUC reporter) were flooded with water or 7mM dicamba  for 40 minutes before the treatment was poured off.  Ten hours after the start of the treatment, whole seedlings were collected"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Cynthia Gleason","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Karam B Singh","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Cynthia Gleason","role":"submitter","email":"cynthia.gleason@csiro.au"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21408147,"authors":"Gleason C, Foley RC, Singh KB","title":"Mutant analysis in Arabidopsis provides insight into the molecular mode of action of the auxinic herbicide dicamba"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["4 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["GSTF8::LUC"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["dicamba","none"]},{"name":"dose","value":["7 millimolar"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1133077,"accession":"P-GSE24052-4"},{"id":1133075,"accession":"P-GSE24052-3"},{"id":1133076,"accession":"P-GSE24052-2"},{"id":1133070,"accession":"P-GSE24052-1"},{"id":1133071,"accession":"P-GSE24052-8"},{"id":1133072,"accession":"P-GSE24052-7"},{"id":1133073,"accession":"P-GSE24052-6"},{"id":1133074,"accession":"P-GSE24052-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
