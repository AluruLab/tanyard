Experiment Description	"The phytohormone GA controls multiple important developmental processes in plants such as germination, elongation growth and flowering time. In this experiment, we look for early GA response genes in 7 day-old light-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. To this end we compare four data sets: (1) a GA biosynthesis mutant ga-1 (SALK_109115) mock treated for 1 hr; (2) a GA biosynthesis mutant ga-1 (SALK_109115) treated for 1 hr with 100 ÂµM GA3; (3) a gid1a-1 gid1b-1 gid1c-2 GA receptor triple mutant mock treated for 1 hr; (4) a gid1a-1 gid1b-1 gid1c-2 GA receptor triple mutant treated for 1 hr with 100 ÂµM GA3. In a comparison of the two ga-1 samples, GA regulated genes can be identified, and the assumption is that bona fide GA regulated genes are not responding in the gid1a-1 gid1b-1 gid1c-2 GA receptor mutant. Experiment Overall Design: We compare four samples of 7 day-old light-grown growth-medium grown seedlings (3 independent biological replicates each): (1) a GA biosynthesis mutant ga-1 (SALK_109115) mock treated for 1 hr; (2) a GA biosynthesis mutant ga-1 (SALK_109115) treated for 1 hr with 100 ÂµM GA3; (3) a gid1a-1 gid1b-1 gid1c-2 GA receptor triple mutant mock treated for 1 hr; (4) a gid1a-1 gid1b-1 gid1c-2 GA receptor triple mutant treated for 1 hr with 100 ÂµM GA3. In a comparison of the two ga-1 samples, GA regulated genes can be identified, and the assumption is that bona fide GA regulated genes are not responding in the gid1a-1 gid1b-1 gid1c-2 GA receptor mutant."

Protocol Description	"Approximately 80 mg from 7 day old, light grown gid1a-1 gid1b-1 gid1c-2  mutant seedlings were mock-treated for 1h, collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen)."
