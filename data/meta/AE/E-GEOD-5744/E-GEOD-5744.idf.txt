Experiment Description	This experiment was annotated by TAIR (http://arabidopsis.org). This experiment studies the response of gene expression in roots of 25-35 day old plants grown on hydroponics after 6, 48 and 96 hours of potassium starvation. RNA from roots was extracted after transfer to control (control) or potassium free nutrient solution respectively (starvation).
