Comment[Submitted Name]	CPIB Lateral Root timecourse
Experiment Description	In Arabidopsis, lateral roots (LRs) originate from pericycle cells located adjacent to vascular tissues, deep within the primary root. Consequently, new LR organs have to emerge through several overlying tissues. Eight stages of LR primordium development have been defined, with stage I representing a single layer of primordium cells generated by the first round of asymmetric divisions and stage VIII defining primordia that have fully emerged through the outer cell layers. To identify novel genes involved in LR development, we generated a transcriptomic time course dataset encompassing each LR developmental stage from pre-initiation to post-emergence.

Protocol Description	Wild-type Col-0 seedlings were grown vertically on _ MS media supplemented with 1 % (w/v) PGP-type agarose (Park Scientific Ltd., UK) for six days in controlled environmental conditions of 24 degree celsius, continuous light of 150 micromol m-1 s-1. Plants for seed propagation were grown simultaneous in controlled conditions with a 16h light (23 degree celsius), 8h dark (18 degree celsius) cycle. On day 6 the plates were placed in 3l tanks containing 0.5x MS for a 24h aclimatisation period.	Plates were rotated by 90 degrees and left for 9hrs after which approximately 50 roots were dissected to isolate a section of mature root away from the gravitropic bend with no lateral root primordia. Dissected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.	Plates were rotated by 90 degrees and left for 6hrs after which approximately 50 roots were dissected to isolate a section of root around the gravitropic bend. Dissected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.	Plates were rotated by 90 degrees and left for 9hrs after which approximately 50 roots were dissected to isolate a section of root around the gravitropic bend. Dissected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.	Plates were rotated by 90 degrees and left for 12hrs after which approximately 50 roots were dissected to isolate a section of root around the gravitropic bend. Dissected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Plates were rotated by 90 degrees and left for 54hrs after which approximately 50 roots were dissected to isolate a section of root around the gravitropic bend. Dissected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.	RNA was extracted using the Qiagen MicroRNA Kit following the manufacturers recommended protocol (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop ND100 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilimington, USA). All RNA samples were approximately 1 microgram/microliter in a total volume of 10 microliter.	RNA labelling and hybridisation to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays were performed by the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC), according to manufacturers recommended protocol for the IVT-express kit< USA). All RNA samples were approximately 1 microgram/microliter in a total volume of 10 microliters.
