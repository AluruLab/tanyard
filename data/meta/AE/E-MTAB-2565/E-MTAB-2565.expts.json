Consequently, new LR organs have to emerge through several overlying tissues. Eight stages of LR primordium development have been defined, with stage I representing a single layer of primordium cells generated by the first round of asymmetric divisions and stage VIII defining primordia that have fully emerged through the outer cell layers. To identify novel genes involved in LR development, we generated a transcriptomic time course dataset encompassing each LR developmental stage from pre-initiation to post-emergence."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Michael Wilson","role":"submitter","email":"michael.wilson@nottingham.ac.uk"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":26144255,"authors":"Voß U, Wilson MH, Kenobi K, Gould PD, Robertson FC, Peer WA, Lucas M, Swarup K, Casimiro I, Holman TJ, Wells DM, Péret B, Goh T, Fukaki H, Hodgman TC, Laplaze L, Halliday KJ, Ljung K, Murphy AS, Hall AJ, Webb AA, Bennett MJ","title":"The circadian clock rephases during lateral root organ initiation in Arabidopsis thaliana","doi":"10.1038\/ncomms8641","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["lateral root primordium formation stage"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["lateral root primordium","primary root"]},{"category":"provider","value":["Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre"]},{"category":"specimen with known storage state","value":["fresh specimen"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"time","value":["0 hour","12 hour","15 hour","18 hour","21 hour","24 hour","27 hour","30 hour","33 hour","36 hour","39 hour","42 hour","45 hour","48 hour","51 hour","54 hour","6 hour","9 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":72,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1008759,"accession":"P-MTAB-39064"},{"id":1008760,"accession":"P-MTAB-39063"},{"id":1008757,"accession":"P-MTAB-39066"},{"id":1008758,"accession":"P-MTAB-39065"},{"id":1008755,"accession":"P-MTAB-39068"},{"id":1008756,"accession":"P-MTAB-39067"},{"id":1008754,"accession":"P-MTAB-39069"},{"id":1008446,"accession":"P-MTAB-39078"},{"id":1008762,"accession":"P-MTAB-39079"},{"id":1008447,"accession":"P-MTAB-39076"},{"id":1008445,"accession":"P-MTAB-39077"},{"id":1008449,"accession":"P-MTAB-39074"},{"id":1008448,"accession":"P-MTAB-39075"},{"id":1008442,"accession":"P-MTAB-39080"},{"id":1008753,"accession":"P-MTAB-39070"},{"id":1008444,"accession":"P-MTAB-39061"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":1008752,"accession":"P-MTAB-39071"},{"id":1008761,"accession":"P-MTAB-39062"},{"id":1008751,"accession":"P-MTAB-39072"},{"id":1008443,"accession":"P-MTAB-39060"},{"id":1008750,"accession":"P-MTAB-39073"},{"id":90533,"accession":"P-AFFY-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":72,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":72,"isderived":0}]}]}}
