AtMYB30, a transcription factor acts as a positive regulator of a cell death pathway conditioning the HR. We show by microarray analyses of Arabidopsis plants misexpressing AtMYB30 that the genes encoding the four enzymes forming the acyl-coA elongase complex, responsible for very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) biosynthesis, are putative targets. Experiment Overall Design: 18 samples are analyzed : Leaves of 4 week-old plants syringe-infiltrated with the Xcc147 strain (or not) were harvested.  In experiment 1, we selected 4 timepoints : T0 (not inoculated), 90-105 min, 2-4 h and 6 h post inoculation in the wild-type line, and in a transgenic line overexpressing AtMYB30. Experiment 2 is a biological replicate of experiment 1 (except for 6 hpi). In experiment 3, we focused on the early timepoint 90-105 min to compare the wild-type line and an AtMYB30 antisense line. Experiment 4 is a biological replicate of experiment 3. Plant material was pooled when necessary, and frozen before RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays. As a screen for candidate target genes, we looked for genes, i) up-regulated in the wild-type line after inoculation with Xcc147 as compared to time T0 (not inoculated) , ii) over-expressed in the AtMYB30 overexpressor line compared to the wild-type, and iii) down-regulated in the AtMYB30 antisense line compared to the wild-type."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Dominique ROBY","role":"submitter","email":"dominique.roby@toulouse.inra.fr"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":18326828,"authors":"Vailleau Raffaele, Joubès Léger, Huard Miersch, Mongrand Blée, Roby Domergue","title":"A MYB Transcription Factor Regulates Very-Long-Chain Fatty Acid Biosynthesis for Activation of the Hypersensitive Cell Death Response in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.107.054858","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["4 weeks"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["AtMYB30","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["AtMYB30","wild_type"]},{"name":"INOCULATION","value":["none","Xanthomonas campestris pv campestris 147"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":420655,"accession":"P-9674-5"},{"id":420654,"accession":"P-9674-4"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":420657,"accession":"P-9674-3"},{"id":420656,"accession":"P-9674-2"},{"id":420653,"accession":"P-9674-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
