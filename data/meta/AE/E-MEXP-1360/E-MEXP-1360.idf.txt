Experiment Description	In order to identify candidate target genes of the OBP1 (At3g50410) transcription factor we used dexamethasone inducible system (Lloyd et al, 1994). A single inducible over-expression line was compared to an empty vector control line 10h after DEX induction to identify candidate genes that were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR.

Protocol Description	C24 was initially soil grown for 2 weeks in short-days (8 h) at 150 µmol m-2 s-1 light before picking and transfer to long-days (16 h) in a greenhouse at a day/night air temperature of 20 °C/18 °C and a minimum of 200 µmol m-2 s-1 light. 	C24 plants transformed with either empty vector [d143(pBI-GR), Lloyd et al. 1994, Science 266, 436] or OBP1:GR fusion were sprayed with 25µM dexamethasone in 0.025% (v/v) Ethanol. Treatment was performed at 09:00 and plants were harvested at 19:00.	Whole rosettes from 3 individual plants were pooled.	Trizol (Invitrogen) extraction following manual.
