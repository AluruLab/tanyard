Comment[Submitted Name]	Comparative physiology and transcriptional networks underlying the heat shock response in Populus trichocarpa, Arabidopsis thaliana and Glycine max [Arabidopsis]							
Experiment Description	The heat shock response continues to be layered with additional complexity as interactions and cross-talk among heat shock proteins, the reactive oxygen network and hormonal signaling are discovered. However, comparative analyses exploring variation in each of these processes among species remains relatively unexplored. In controlled environment experiments, photosynthetic response curves were conducted from 22 °C to 42 °C and indicated that temperature optimum of light saturated photosynthesis was greater for Glycine max relative to Arabidopsis thaliana or Populus trichocarpa. Transcript profiles were taken at defined states along the temperature response curves and inferred pathway analysis revealed species-specific variation in the abiotic stress and the minor carbohydrate raffinose/galactinol pathways. A weighted gene co-expression network approach was used to group individual genes into network modules linking biochemical measures of the antioxidant system to leaf-level photosynthesis among P. trichocarpa, G. max and A. thaliana. Network enabled results revealed an expansion in the G. max HSP17 protein family and divergence in the regulation of the antioxidant and heat shock module relative to P. trichocarpa and A. thaliana. These results indicate that although the heat shock response is highly conserved, there is considerable species-specific variation in its regulation. fully expanded leaf samples from 4 randomly collected plants per species were harvested at 4 physiological states as determined from prior gas exchange measurements (growth temperature - baseline, photosynthetic optimum, 20% inhibition of optimum and 30% inhibition of optimum).This resulted in 16 separate samples hybridized to independent microarrays totaling 4 – replicates x 4 physiological states).

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA data	Following fragmentation, cRNA was hybridized to the ATH1 Affymetrix slide according to standard protocols (#PM702232; www.affymetrix.com).	Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col-0) were imbibed at 4 °C with distilled water for 4d to facilitate uniform germination.  The seeds were resuspended in 0.05% agarose after the cold treatment and planted in pots containing Fafard 3B mix (Conrad Fafard, Agawam, MA).  Plants were grown in a Conviron BDW80 walk-in growth chamber under the following growth conditions: 22 °C, 60% relative humidity, a 10 h photoperiod, and 350 μmol m-2s-1 light intensity. Plants were watered as needed and fertilized weekly using 125 ppm N of Jack's Professional	All data were analyzed using the limma package in the Bioconductor software (v.2.4). Gene level information for RMA normalized expression values are presented within the matrix for all samples analyzed.	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 according to standard protocol #PM702232; www.affymetrix.com.	For the microarray analysis, fully expanded leaf samples from 4 randomly collected plants per species were harvested at 4 physiological states as determined from prior gas exchange measurements (growth temperature - baseline, photosynthetic optimum, 20% inhibition of optimum and 30% inhibition of optimum). The temperature response curves were created by increasing temperature step-wise (2 °C per 10 mins) from 22 to 42 °C to the desired physiological state and waiting 20-30 mins for photosynthesis to stabilize before sampling. Each curve took 3-4 h to complete.	Total RNA was isolated from 100 mg of tissue using an RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  An on-column DNase 1 treatment (Sigma-Aldrich) was used during RNA extraction to remove any potential genomic DNA contamination.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
