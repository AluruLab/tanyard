Investigation Title	Identification of Direct Targets of SND1 and VND7					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Identification of Direct Targets of SND1 and VND7					
Experiment Description	This study was to find genes directly regulated by SND1 and VND7. SND1XVE- or VND7XVE-expressing cells were treated with cycloheximide alone (control) or with cycloheximide plus estradiol (experimental) to identify genes directly activated by SND1 or VND7.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5 Detection signal<br>ABS_CALL = =Indication of whether the transcript is present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneArray Scanner 3000.	Standard Affymetrix GeneChip Technology.	Total RNA was isolated using the QIAGEN Plant RNA isolation kit. 	Affymetrix One-Cycle Eukaryotic Target Labeling kit.	Expression values are calculated based on the difference of the PM signal and MM signal at each of the probe pairs using the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System (GCOS). This software employs statistical algorithms to calculate qualitative and quantitative expression values for each transcript. It also generates a statistical p-value, which suggests the level of confidence in each of the qualitative measurements.
