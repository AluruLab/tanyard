We identified an essential regulator of cold-responsive genes and used the Affymetrix whole-genome arrays to define downstream targets of this important protein. We used the microarrays to reveal the effect of rcf1-1 mutation on global gene expression with or without cold stress at 4°C. A set of genes differentially expressed in rcf1-1 with or without cold stress are identified. Fourteen-day-old seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (Columbia gl1 expressing CBF2::LUC transgene) and rcf1-1 mutant seedlings subjected to cold stress at 4°C for 0, 12, and 24 h were used for total RNA extraction and hybridizations with Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips. There are two biological replicate per genotype."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Jianhua Zhu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jianmin Wu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Qingmei Guan","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jianhua  Zhu","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Chenglin Chai","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Yanyan Zhang","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Changhua Jiang","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Renyi Liu","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23371945,"authors":"Guan Q, Wu J, Zhang Y, Jiang C, Liu R, Chai C, Zhu J","title":"A DEAD Box RNA Helicase Is Critical for Pre-mRNA Splicing, Cold-Responsive Gene Regulation, and Cold Tolerance in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.112.108340"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["Fourteen-day-old"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedlings"]},{"category":"variation","value":["rcf1-1","wild type"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"TREATMENT","value":["cold at 4ï¿½C","control"]},{"name":"VARIATION","value":["rcf1-1","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":730457,"accession":"P-GSE39090-7"},{"id":730458,"accession":"P-GSE39090-8"},{"id":730459,"accession":"P-GSE39090-6"},{"id":730460,"accession":"P-GSE39090-5"},{"id":730461,"accession":"P-GSE39090-4"},{"id":730462,"accession":"P-GSE39090-3"},{"id":730463,"accession":"P-GSE39090-2"},{"id":730456,"accession":"P-GSE39090-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
