Comment[Submitted Name]	The rcf1-1 mutation affects global gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana with or without cold stress.
Experiment Description	Cold stress is one of the most severe environmental conditions which cause huge losses in crop production worldwide. We identified an essential regulator of cold-responsive genes and used the Affymetrix whole-genome arrays to define downstream targets of this important protein. We used the microarrays to reveal the effect of rcf1-1 mutation on global gene expression with or without cold stress at 4Â°C. A set of genes differentially expressed in rcf1-1 with or without cold stress are identified. Fourteen-day-old seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (Columbia gl1 expressing CBF2::LUC transgene) and rcf1-1 mutant seedlings subjected to cold stress at 4Â°C for 0, 12, and 24 h were used for total RNA extraction and hybridizations with Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips. There are two biological replicate per genotype.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA normalized log2 signal intensity	Following fragmentation, 10 µg of cRNA was hybridized for 16 h at 45°C on Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	Arabidopsis seedlings on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium agar plates (1x MS salts, 2% sucrose, 0.6% agar, pH 5.7) were grown under cool, white light (~120 Î¼mol m-2 s-1) at 21 ± 1â„ƒ with a 16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod.	The datasets were subjected to the Robust Multiarray Averaging (RMA) normalization method. The normalized data were further analyzed and p-values were generated by the affymGUI component of Bioconductor in statistics environment R with the default parameters.Genes were selected by the RankProd (non-paramteric method based on the estimated percentage of false discoveries (p value < 0.05)) method. Normalized expression values presented in Matrix table are log2 values.	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.	Fourteen-day-old wild type and rcf1-1 mutant plants were subjuected to cold stress at 4°C for 0, 12, and 24 h.	Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 µg total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
