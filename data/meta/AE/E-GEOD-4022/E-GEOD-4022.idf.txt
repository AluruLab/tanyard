Experiment Description	The effect of sucrose feeding on gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves was investigated using affymetrix ATH1 microarrays. For this, petioles of detached leaves were put in a solution containing either sucrose or sorbitol (control). Sugars were taken up into the leaf via the respiration stream for 13 hours. After that, leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA was extracted for analysis.

Protocol Description	Source leaves were cut at the end of the day from non-flowering plants. Leaf peteoles were recut under buffer (2mM MES, pH6.5) and placed in buffer + 100mM sucrose for 13hours in the dark. After incubation discs were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
