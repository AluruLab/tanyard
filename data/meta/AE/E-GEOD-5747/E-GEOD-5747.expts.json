Effective analysis of gene expression during the cell cycle depends on achieving a good level of synchronisation. Until recently, analysis of cell cycle processes in plants has been hampered by the lack of synchronizable cell suspensions for Arabidopsis. We have recently developed a cell synchrony system for Arabidopsis cell suspensions MM1 and MM2d, and have developed two methods of synchronization. The first synchronizes cycling cells by blocking cells at the G1\/S boundary using aphidicolin. The second uses sucrose removal and resupply to synchronize cells during re-entry into the cell cycle. Cell cycle synchrony in suspension cultured cells: cells can be reproducibly synchronized by blocking at the G1\/S boundary or in early S phase using aphidicolin for 24 hr and then reversing the block by washing (Menges and Murray, 2002). On aphidicolin removal, the synchronous resumption of S phase and progression through the cell cycle occur and sequential RNA samples were taken at 2-3 hourly intervals over a 19 hour period. We have carried out a transcriptional profiling analysis with the aim to study gene expression during cell cycle progression after aphidicolin treatment of suspension-cultured cells using the near full genome ATH1 arrays (Menges et al., 2003).
