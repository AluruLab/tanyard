Experiment Description	This experiment was provided by TAIR (http://arabidopsis.org). Effective analysis of gene expression during the cell cycle depends on achieving a good level of synchronisation. Until recently, analysis of cell cycle processes in plants has been hampered by the lack of synchronizable cell suspensions for Arabidopsis. We have recently developed a cell synchrony system for Arabidopsis cell suspensions MM1 and MM2d, and have developed two methods of synchronization. The first synchronizes cycling cells by blocking cells at the G1/S boundary using aphidicolin. The second uses sucrose removal and resupply to synchronize cells during re-entry into the cell cycle. Cell cycle synchrony in suspension cultured cells: cells can be reproducibly synchronized by blocking at the G1/S boundary or in early S phase using aphidicolin for 24 hr and then reversing the block by washing (Menges and Murray, 2002). On aphidicolin removal, the synchronous resumption of S phase and progression through the cell cycle occur and sequential RNA samples were taken at 2-3 hourly intervals over a 19 hour period. We have carried out a transcriptional profiling analysis with the aim to study gene expression during cell cycle progression after aphidicolin treatment of suspension-cultured cells using the near full genome ATH1 arrays (Menges et al., 2003).

Protocol Description	20 ml of an early stationary phase MM2d cell suspension (7 days after previous subculture) was transferred into 100 ml fresh MSS-medium (MS-salt, 3% sucrose, 0.5mg/l NAA, 0.05mg/l kinetin) and incubated in the presence of 4.16 ug/ml aphidicolin (not exp.variable) for 24 hours under continuous darkness by rotating at 130 rpm at a temperature of 27C.
