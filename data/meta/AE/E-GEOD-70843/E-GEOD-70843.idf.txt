Investigation Title	Genome-wide expression analysis of bri1-5 and its suppressors brs1-1D, bak1-1D, bri1-1D						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Genome-wide expression analysis of bri1-5 and its suppressors brs1-1D, bak1-1D, bri1-1D						
Experiment Description	bri1-5 is a weak mutant of Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1). Suppressors by activation tagging bri1-1D, brs1-1D and bak1-1D can recover bri1-5 phenotype. We use microarray to investigate which pathways or functional categories have been transcriptionally regulated by bri1-1D, brs1-1D and bak1-1D. Whole seedlings from wild-type (WS2), bri1-5, bri1-5/brs1-1D, bri1-5/bak1-1D, bri1-5/bri1-1D. Three biological replicates for each genotype.

Protocol Name	P-GSE70843-1	P-GSE70843-5	P-GSE70843-6	P-GSE70843-2	P-GSE70843-3	P-GSE70843-4	P-GSE70843-7
Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with EXPANDAR 6.0 and gc-RMA normalization method. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 (gc-RMA)	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol	20 ug of biotin labeled cRNA were hybridized with Arabidopsis ATH1 genome array, according to the Affymetrix manufacturer's instruction.	The 5-days light-grown seedlings were frozen in liquid nitrogen	Seedlings were grown on solid MS medium with 1% sucrose in the light for 5 days.	Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy (QIAGEN)	Scanning of Arrays by Agilent GeneArray Scanner.
