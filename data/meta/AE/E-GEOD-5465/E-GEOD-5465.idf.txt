Experiment Description	10-day-old wild-type and homozygous transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings (overexpressing OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B) grown under normal growth conditions were used for total RNA isolation. The 5 micrograms of each total RNA sample was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix protocol.  Experiment Overall Design: The experiment involves the study of differential gene expression in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing rice topoisomerase 6 subunit A (OsTOP6A3) and subunit B (OsTOP6B) cDNAs as compared to wild-type.Two biological replicates for each sample were used for microarray analysis.

Protocol Type	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	hybridization	feature_extraction		
Protocol Description	Seeds were surface sterilized with 2% sodium hypochlorite and 0.01% triton X-100 for 5 min followed by rinsing in sterile water for 5 times. Seeds were then suspended in 0.1% agar solution and dispensed on 0.8% agar-gelled MS medium containing 2% sucrose. Plates were sealed and shifted to cold room for 72 h to break dormancy and facilitate uniform germination and then transferred to culture room under continuous illumination.
