Therefore, exgeneous H2O2 application mostly impose oxidative stress. To reduce endogenous H2O2 background, we adopted a strategy which is to grow Arabidopsis seedlings in the dark to eliminate light-induced H2O2 production, thus to reduce the endogenous H2O2 level. Exogenous H2O2 was then applied to induce transcriptome changes. Global gene expression is studied and compared between samples collected under 7d dark, 7d H2O2 treatment under dark and 7d light conditions. We cultured seedlings in the dark to reduce endogenous H2O2. Three conditions were used for transcriptome profiling: dark grown (dark); dark grown with exogenous H2O2 treatment (H2O2); and light grown (light). Three types of conditions were used for Arabidopsis seedling culture: dark, dark with 5 mM H2O2 treatment and light. Each condition was performed with two biological replicates. The seedlings were harvested at 7 days old."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Han Cheng","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Dianjing Guo","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedling"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"TREATMENT","value":["5 mM H2O2","control","light"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":634089,"accession":"P-GSE40574-3"},{"id":634086,"accession":"P-GSE40574-2"},{"id":634092,"accession":"P-GSE40574-5"},{"id":634087,"accession":"P-GSE40574-4"},{"id":634088,"accession":"P-GSE40574-7"},{"id":634091,"accession":"P-GSE40574-6"},{"id":634090,"accession":"P-GSE40574-8"},{"id":634085,"accession":"P-GSE40574-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
