The involvement of each of these hormone signaling pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated in response to infection of a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, A. brassicicola. Arabideopsis mutants deficient in these hormone signaling pathways were compared to wild type. Expression profiles were obtained from leaves of wild-type (Col-0), dde2-2, ein2-1, and sid2-2 plants at 9 and 24 hours after A. brassicicola inoculation. In addition, expression profiles were obtained from wild-type at 9 and 24 hours after mock inoculation. The replicates were made from three independent experiments (i.e., biological replicates). Please note that 'Col-0 at 24 hpi with A. brassicicola, biological rep 3' was excluded from data processing because the data did not pass a QC based on affyPML of Bioconducter."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Jane Glazebrook","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Chris Botanga","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jane Glazebrook","role":"submitter","email":"jglazebr@umn.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":24439900,"authors":"Kim Y, Tsuda K, Igarashi D, Hillmer RA, Sakakibara H, Myers CL, Katagiri F","title":"Mechanisms underlying robustness and tunability in a plant immune signaling network.","doi":"10.1016\/j.chom.2013.12.002"},{"accession":24367018,"authors":"Bethke G, Grundman RE, Sreekanta S, Truman W, Katagiri F, Glazebrook J.","title":"Arabidopsis PECTIN METHYLESTERASEs contribute to immunity against Pseudomonas syringae.","doi":"10.1104\/pp.113.227637"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["3 week"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["dde2-2","ein2-1","sid2-2","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf"]},{"category":"sampling site","value":["third to fifth true leaves"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["dde2-2","ein2-1","sid2-2","wild type"]},{"name":"infect","value":["Alternaria brassicicola","mock"]},{"name":"sampling time point","value":["24 hours post infection","9 hours post infection"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":29,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1171504,"accession":"P-GSE50526-7"},{"id":1171505,"accession":"P-GSE50526-6"},{"id":1171506,"accession":"P-GSE50526-5"},{"id":1171508,"accession":"P-GSE50526-4"},{"id":1171507,"accession":"P-GSE50526-3"},{"id":1171509,"accession":"P-GSE50526-2"},{"id":1171503,"accession":"P-GSE50526-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":29,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":29,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":29,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":29,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":29,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":29,"isderived":0}]}]}}
