Investigation Title	Expression data from 7-day-old Arabidopsis emf2 mutant, rescued emf2 mutant harboring 35S::BoEMF2.1, WT Columbia ecotype and WT harboring 35S::BoEMF2.1 named transWT							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from 7-day-old Arabidopsis emf2 mutant, rescued emf2 mutant harboring 35S::BoEMF2.1, WT Columbia ecotype and WT harboring 35S::BoEMF2.1 named transWT
Experiment Description	Arabidopsis emf2 mutants bypass vegetative development and flowering upon seed germination. We introduced a broccoli BoEMF2.1 gene into emf2 mutants and obtained rescued emf2 plants that harbored 35S::BoEMF2.1. We found that BoEMF2.1 can partially rescue the phenotype of emf2 to that of WT. We used microarrays to study the global program of gene expression and to identify genes misexpressed in the Arabidopsis emf2 mutant that had been rescued by 35S::BoEMF2.1. 7-day-old seedlings of WT, transWT, emf2 and rescued emf2 Arabidopsis were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16.5 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Seedlings were grown on 0.8% agar plates with half-strength MS and 1.5% sucrose under short day conditions (8h light/ 16h dark) at 21 degrees Celsius.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as the normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 500.	GeneChips were scanned using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.	Seedlings of rescued emf2 and transWT were grown on plates with 20 mg/mL hygromycin, while those of WT and emf2 were grown on MS-only plates, under short day conditions (8h/16h) for 7 days.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 701021 Rev. 5, Affymetrix).
