Publication Title	The Arabidopsis chromatin modifier ATX1, the myotubularin-like AtMTM and the response to drought.

Experiment Description	Plants respond to environmental stresses by altering transcription of genes involved in the response. The chromatin modifier ATX1 influences gene expression and factors that modulate ATX1 activity would affect indirectly the expression of ATX1-regulated genes.  Here, we demonstrate that dehydration is such a factor indicating that ATX1 is involved in the plantâs response to drought. In addition, we show that a hitherto unknown Arabidopsis gene, At3g10550, encodes MYO1, a phosphoinositide 3â-phosphatase related to the animal myotubularins. By a functional genomics approach, we show that ATX1 and MYO1 participate in overlapping drought-response pathways. The shared set of genes, representing the ultimate targets of an ATX1-MYO1 signaling mechanism responding to drought, provided insights into the relationship of the epigenetic factor and the lipid phosphatase from the other end of the response pathway.  Keywords: control/treatment Arabidopsis thaliana Col0 wild type, atx1 mutant, and MYO-OX line RNA was isolated from control (watered) and treatment (water-deficit) samples for analysis on microarrays with two biological reps.

Protocol Description	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Four week old plants were continued to be watered.	Soil water deficit stress was imposed on four week old plants by withholding water until plants reached a relative water content (RWC) of 65%.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol (reaction at 37C for 16h) from 15 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 15 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C, refer to GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (www.affymetrix.com). GeneChips were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate on an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G; Pixel size: 1.56 um; Filter: 570 nm.	The data was analysed using Affyminer. Arrays were normalised via RMA, and all treatments were compared to the control watered wildtype.  A p-value of 0.05 was taken as significance cutoff, and a 1.5 log2ratio cutoff was also applied.
