The chromatin modifier ATX1 influences gene expression and factors that modulate ATX1 activity would affect indirectly the expression of ATX1-regulated genes.  Here, we demonstrate that dehydration is such a factor indicating that ATX1 is involved in the plant’s response to drought. In addition, we show that a hitherto unknown Arabidopsis gene, At3g10550, encodes MYO1, a phosphoinositide 3’-phosphatase related to the animal myotubularins. By a functional genomics approach, we show that ATX1 and MYO1 participate in overlapping drought-response pathways. The shared set of genes, representing the ultimate targets of an ATX1-MYO1 signaling mechanism responding to drought, provided insights into the relationship of the epigenetic factor and the lipid phosphatase from the other end of the response pathway.
