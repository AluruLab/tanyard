These physiological processes can be affected by various abiotic and biotic stressors. Here we looked at how the two commonly used nanoparticles, nano-titania (TiO2) and nano-ceria (CeO2) can impact the underlying mechanisms associated with germination at genome level. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying various physiological processes associated with growth and development, and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. 12 day old Arabidopsis germinants were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Arabidopsis seeds were individually exposed to 500mg\/L concentration of nano-titania and nano-ceria for 12 days, followed by extraction of RNA for Microarray analysis. 0.1M KCl was used as control for nano-titania, whereas sterilized millipore water was used as control for nano-ceria."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Laxminath Tumburu","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Laxminath Tumburu","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":25242526,"authors":"Tumburu L, Andersen CP, Rygiewicz PT, Reichman JR","title":"Phenotypic and genomic responses to titanium dioxide and cerium oxide nanoparticles in Arabidopsis germinants"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["12 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedling"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["nano-ceria","nano-titania","potassium chloride","water"]},{"name":"dose","value":["0.1 molar","500 milligram per liter"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1132521,"accession":"P-GSE59809-1"},{"id":1132526,"accession":"P-GSE59809-2"},{"id":1132522,"accession":"P-GSE59809-7"},{"id":1132524,"accession":"P-GSE59809-5"},{"id":1132523,"accession":"P-GSE59809-6"},{"id":1132527,"accession":"P-GSE59809-3"},{"id":1132525,"accession":"P-GSE59809-4"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
