Investigation Title	Transcriptome of Arabidopsis APS kinase null mutants						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome of Arabidopsis APS kinase null mutants						
Experiment Description	The aim of the experiment is to look at transcriptional changes in null mutants of APS kinase. There are four APS kinase isoforms in Arabidopsis, we are interested in the double mutant APK1/APK2, created by crossing two single salk lines. The transcriptomes of WT (Col-0) plants and the double knockout (ab) will be compared. The plants were grown under controlled environment conditions of 10h day, 14h night, 22 degrees centigrade, 60% humidity for five weeks. 10 whole rosettes were pooled for each replicate, there are three replicates for each genotype.  Keywords: Expression profiling by array 6 samples were used in this experiment

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5 normalized signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = present, marginal, absent calls<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol	The seeds were kept in water for 3 days at 4 degrees centigrade prior to sowing. Seeds were placed individually on compost and placed in a controlled environment room (CER). The growth regime was 10h light 14h dark, 22 degrees centigrade with 60% humidity. The plants were watered every day. After 5 weeks growth in the CER, the rosettes were harvested by cutting the plant at the top of the root and freezing immediately in liquid nitrogen. Harvesting was done at 12 noon, 4 hours after the lights had come on. Ten rosettes were pooled for each replicate, and three replicates were harvested.	Labelled using protocol described in Affymetrix manual &quot;3' IVT Express Kit User Manual&quot;	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
