There are four APS kinase isoforms in Arabidopsis, we are interested in the double mutant APK1\/APK2, created by crossing two single salk lines. The transcriptomes of WT (Col-0) plants and the double knockout (ab) will be compared. The plants were grown under controlled environment conditions of 10h day, 14h night, 22 degrees centigrade, 60% humidity for five weeks. 10 whole rosettes were pooled for each replicate, there are three replicates for each genotype.
