Experiment Description	The goal of this investigation was to identify putative targets of the TELOMERASE ACTIVATOR 1 transcription factor. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was isolated from leaves of 3 week old plants.  We used three biological replicates of wild type (Columbia) and the tac1-1D activation tagged line (Ren et al., 2004. Plant Cell 16; 2910-2922).
