Investigation Title	Root nitrate response of Col-0 plants and tga1/tga4 mutant plants										
Comment[Submitted Name]	Root nitrate response of Col-0 plants and tga1/tga4 mutant plants										
Experiment Description	Nitrate regulates plant growth and development and acts as a potent signal to control gene expression in Arabidopsis. Using an integrative bioinformatics approach we identified TGA1 and TGA4 as putative regulatory factors that mediate nitrate responses in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. We showed that both TGA1 and TGA4 mRNAs accumulate strongly and quickly after nitrate treatments in root organs in a tissue-specific manner. Phenotypic analysis of tga1/tga4 double mutant plants indicated that TGA1 and TGA4 are necessary for nitrate modulation of both primary and lateral root growth. Global gene expression analysis revealed that 97% of the genes with altered expression in tga1/tga4 double mutant plants are regulated by nitrate treatments indicating these transcription factors have a specific role in nitrate responses in Arabidopsis root organs. Among the nitrate-responsive genes that depend on TGA1/TGA4 for normal regulation of gene expression, we found nitrate transporters NRT2.1, NRT2.2 and nitrite reductase (NIR) genes. Specific binding of TGA1 to its cognate DNA sequence on the target gene promoters was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. These results identify TGA1 and TGA4 as important regulatory factors of the nitrate response in Arabidopsis roots. Arabidopsis seedlings of the Col-0 and tga1/tga4 genotypes were grown on hydroponic medium containing 1X MS salts without Nitrogen, supplemented with 0.5 mM ammonium succinate as Nitrogen source and 3 mM sucrose on a Percival chamber under a photoperiod of 16 hours of light (100 μE/m2/sec) and 8 hours of dark at 22°C for 14 days. The plants were treated at the onset of the light cycle with 5 mM KNO3 or 5 mM KCl as control for 2 hours. Whole roots were cut from seedlings and frozen on liquid Nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using the TriZol reagent. 3 independent biological replicates were performed.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 rma signal	ATH1 chips were hybridized using the GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain kit from Affymetrix	Arabidopsis seedlings of the Col 0 and tga1/tga4 genotypes were grown on hydroponic medium containing 1X MS salts without Nitrogen, supplemented with 0.5 mM ammonium succinate as Nitrogen source and 3 mM sucrose on a Percival chamber under a photoperiod of 16 hours of light (100 μE/m2/sec) and 8 hours of dark at 22�C for 14 days.	The summarized probe set data was generated using R/bioconductor (affy library). Normalization of the data was performed using rma. Normalized data was subjected to a two-way ANOVA analysis with a false discovery rate of 5 %.	Chips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G and the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console Scan Control 1.1.0.845 software	Plants were treated at the onset of the light period on day 15 with 5 mM KNO3 or 5 mM KCl as control for 2 hours. Roots were cut and frozen on liquid nitrogen.	Total RNA was extracted using the TriZol reagent as indicated by the manufacturer.	Bioitinylated cRNA was prepared using the GeneChip 3'IVT kit from Affymetrix
