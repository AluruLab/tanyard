Experiment Description	Arabidopsis nudix hydrolase 7 knock-out mutant Atnudt7-1 exhibits a reduced size phenotype when compared with age-matched Col-0 wildtype plants growing in potting mix of 12 parts vermiculite: 3 parts redi-earth and 1 part sand.  In these array experiments the differences in gene expression caused by this mutation is assessed in comparison to wildtype plants.

Protocol Description	Total RNA was isolated using the Plant RNeasy kit (Qiagen) <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Seeds of WT, transgenic (P35S:AtNudt7), and mutant (Atnudt7-1) lines were stratified in 0.1% Phytagel (Caisson Laboratories) at 4 C for 3 days. Seeds were sown in pots containing either a mixture of 12 parts vermiculite, 3 parts Redi-earth (composition: 55-65% sphagnum peat moss, vermiculite, dolomitic lime; Sun Gro Horticulture) and 1 part sand (12:3:1) or Metro-Mix 200 (MM) potting mix (Scotts) for 4 weeks in a growth chamber. Plants were maintained at 22 C, 45% relative humidity, 100 Âµmol m-2 s-1 light intensity and 10 h day and 14 h dark conditions. Plants were irrigated using tap water. <br>(Parameters: start time = 10, time unit = seconds, min temperature = 18, max temperature = 21, temperature unit = C, media = 12 parts vermiculite: 3 parts redi-earth: 1 part sand)	Arabidopsis Atnudt7-1 mutant plants and wildtype Col-0 plants were grown in 12 parts of vermiculite, 3 parts of redi-earth and 1 part of sand for 4 weeks in growth rooms with 10 h of day length and 14 h of darkness.  The plants were raised in moderate light conditions of 100 micro mols.	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
