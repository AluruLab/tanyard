The pho3 mutant had a P deficient phenotype in vitro and in the leaves of soil grown pho3 plants the total P content was again reduced. pho3 exhibited a number of characteristics normally associated with low-P stress, including severely reduced growth, increased anthocyanin content and starch accumulation. pho3 was shown to have an absolute requirement for exogenous sucrose as pho3 seedlings were arrested in early seedling development on sucrose-free medium and was unaffected by Pi-availability. pho3 was found to be insensitive to high concentrations of exogenous sucrose (10%) but was sensitive to glucose. pho3 also exhibited reduced sensitivity of seed germination to exogenous ABA (abi-phenotype), a response which has been linked to sucrose insensitivity in both sugar-sensing and ABA mutants. Two developmental stages have been selected on the basis of the physiological characterisation of pho3. Seedlings (1.02; 2 rosette leaves) grown in agar and compost-grown plants (3.90; rosette growth complete). Agar will be supplemented with 1% sucrose and 1\/2 strength MS; plants will be grown under a 16 h light\/8 h dark cycle. Comparisons will be made between pho3 and Wassilewskija (the genetic background of the mutant) at each stage.
