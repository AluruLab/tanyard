"Total RNA was extract from ground tissue frozen in liquid nitrogen using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"	One biological replicate consisted of the pooled aboveground tissues plus roots from 30 Arabidopsis plants.	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	"Samples are prepared for hybridisation to the GeneChip by preparing a probe cocktail (cRNA @ 0.05ìg/ul) that includes 1x Hybridisation Buffer (100mM MES, 1m NaCl, 20mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween-20), 0.1mg/ml Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5mg/ml BSA, and 7% DMSO. A total hybridisation volume of 300ìl is prepared for each sample and 200ìl loaded into a GeneChip. The chip is hybridised at 45C for 16 hours in an oven with a rotating wheel at 60rpm.<br>(Parameters: Chamber type = Affymetrix- GeneChip Hyb Oven 640, Quantity of label target used = 10, Mass unit = Micro gram, time = 16, Tiny time unit = hours, Volume = 200, Volume unit = Micro litre, temperature = 45)"	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
