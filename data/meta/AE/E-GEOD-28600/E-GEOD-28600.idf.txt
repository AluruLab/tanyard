Experiment Description	Plant hormones involved in environmental stresses, namely abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), and jasmonic acid (JA), have been shown to interact with each other in a complex manner. To address the network of the hormone interactions, we have investigated the changes in expression under multiple hormone treatments, ABA+SA and ABA+JA. We chose cultured cells to remove the difference in the response to hormones among developmental cells or tissues. The cells were treated for 3hr and 24hr to see the rapid or transient response and steady-state response. The obtained data indicate that ABA and SA affect antagonistically, but these hormones affected many genes collaboratively. Indeed, according to the microarray data, there are many genes that responded only to ABA+SA. In addition, the ABA+SA responsive genes also responded to ABA+JA. These data suggest that hormone crosstalk is more complicated than expected and that more systematic analysis is required to untangle the hormone crosstalk network. To investigate the hormonal interactions, Arabidopsis T87 cultured cells were exposed to ABA, SA, or JA alone, or two hormones simultaneously, ABA+SA or ABA+JA, for 3hr and 24 hr. Comparing the data among those treatments, the relationships among these hormones were deduced.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = probe ID of ATH1 GeneChip<br>VALUE = RMA normalized in log2 expression	30 ug cRNA was hybridized to ATH1 GeneChip arrays.	The cells were incubated and subcultured every seven days in 20 mL of a liquid modified JPL medium (Axelos et al., 1992) in a 100 mL baffled Erlenmeyer flask at 100 rpm on a rotary shake at 24C at a 16 h light and 8 h dark cycle.	RMA normalized using Cel file with affllmGUI.	Arrays were scanned using a GSC3000 scanner according to the manufacturer's recommendations.	Growing T87 cells were exposed to 25 uM ABA for 24hr.	Growing T87 cells were exposed to 25uM ABA and 300 uM SA for 3hr.	Growing T87 cells were exposed to 300 uM SA for 24hr.	Growing T87 cells were exposed to 0.6% EtOH.	Growing T87 cells were exposed to 100 uM MeJA for 24hr.	Growing T87 cells were exposed to 100 uM MeJA for 3hr.	Growing T87 cells were exposed to 25uM ABA and 300 uM SA for 24hr.	Growing T87 cells were exposed to 25 uM ABA for 3hr.	Growing T87 cells were exposed to 25uM ABA and 100 uM MeJA for 3hr.	Growing T87 cells were exposed to 25uM ABA and 100 uM MeJA for 24hr.	Growing T87 cells were exposed to 300 uM SA for 3hr.	Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using a RNase MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen).	First-strand of cDNA was synthesized using 16 ug of total RNA and SuperScript Double-stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The labeled cRNA was synthesized using BioArray RNA Transcripts Labeling Kit (T7) (ENZO Life Sciences inc.). After labeling, the cRNA was digested partially by incubating in 40 mM Tris-acetate, pH8.0, 100 mM KOAc, 30 mM MgOAc, at 94C for 35 min.
