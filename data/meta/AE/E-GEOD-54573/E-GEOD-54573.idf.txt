Investigation Title	Identification of target genes of translation-dependent signalling in Arabidopsis					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Identification of target genes of translation-dependent signalling in Arabidopsis					
Experiment Description	Changes ins organellar gene expression trigger retrograde signalling. Prolyl-tRNA synthetase (PRORS1) is located in chloroplasts and mitochondria. Thus, prors1-2 mutants are impaired in chloroplast and mitochondrial gene expression. The effects of the prors1-2 mutation on the global transcriptome were investigated with microarray analyses. RNA was extracted from Col-0 (WT, 4-weeks-old) and prors1-2 (38-d-old) leaves of the same developmental stage

Protocol Description	Normalization was done with gcRMA implemented in Flexarray. ID_REF =  VALUE = signal intensity	Biotinlylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, Affymetrix).	Hybridisation, washing, staining, and scanning procedures were performed as described in the Affymetrix technical manual. A Hybridisation Oven 640 was used	A. thaliana plants were grown on potting soil (Stender) under controlled growth chamber conditions (16 h/8 h light/dark cycles with ~100 umol photons m-2 s-1 on leaf surfaces). Wuxal Super fertilizer (8% N, 8% P2O5, and 6% K2O; MANNA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	RNA was extracted with the Rneasy Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions	A GeneChip Scanner 3000 was used according to the Affymetrix protocol
