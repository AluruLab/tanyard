We recently isolated Arabidopsis sugar-inducible cotyledon yellow-192 (sicy-192), a gain-of-function mutant of plastidic invertase (INV-E), and showed that following the treatment of this mutant with sucrose, the expression of PhANGs decreased while that of nitrate reductase 1 (NIA1) increased. Plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP)-dependent PGE was markedly suppressed in the sicy-192 mutant by the sucrose treatment.  A double mutant of sicy-192 and gun1-101, a null mutant of GUN1, revealed that metabolic perturbation in the sucrose-treated sicy-192 mutant was, at least in part, dependent on GUN1. To confirm whether there is a relationship between plastid sugar metabolism and nuclear gene expression, we performed a microarray analysis using Suc-treated 3 genotypes consisting of wild-type, sicy-192, and sicy-192 gun1-101 plants. Wild-type, sicy-192, and sicy-192 gun1-101 plants were grown on MS medium containing 100 mM sucrose in a growth chamber kept at 25°C during 16 h of light (100 µmol\/m2\/s) and at 22°C during 8 h of darkness for 4 days. At 4 days of age, cotyledons were collected as samples for microarray analysis."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Kazuya Yoshimura","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Takanori Maruta","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Shigeru Shigeoka","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["sicy-192","sicy-192 gun1-101","wild-type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["cotyledons"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["sicy-192","sicy-192 gun1-101","wild-type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":856296,"accession":"P-GSE50857-7"},{"id":856298,"accession":"P-GSE50857-5"},{"id":856297,"accession":"P-GSE50857-6"},{"id":856301,"accession":"P-GSE50857-3"},{"id":856300,"accession":"P-GSE50857-4"},{"id":856295,"accession":"P-GSE50857-1"},{"id":856299,"accession":"P-GSE50857-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
