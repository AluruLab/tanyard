The conditional flu mutant of Arabidopsis accumulates excess protochlorophyllide in the dark within chloroplast membranes that upon illumination acts as a photosensitizer and generates singlet oxygen. Immediately after the release of singlet oxygen mature flu plants stop growing, whereas seedlings bleach and die. Within the first 30 min after the release of singlet oxygen rapid changes in nuclear gene expression occur. Distinct sets of genes were activated that were different from those induced by other reactive oxygen species, superoxide or hydrogen peroxide. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves were harvested after 30 min, 1h, and 2 h of reillumination following a 8h dark period for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.  Plants were grown on soil for 3 weeks under continuous light at 90 mmol. m-2 . s-1. For each sample, the rosette leaves of five to six 3-week-old plants (before they start bolting) were collected for RNA extraction. Total RNAs from two separate biological experiments were pooled for the preparation of cDNA and the subsequent synthesis of biotin-labeled complementary RNA as recommended by Affymetrix."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Christophe Laloi","role":"submitter","email":"claloi@ethz.ch"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":14508004,"authors":"Roel G L op den Camp, Dominika Przybyla, Christian Ochsenbein, Christophe Laloi, Chanhong Kim, Antoine Danon, Daniela Wagner, Eva Hideg, Cornelia GÃ¶bel, Ivo Feussner, Mena Nater, Klaus Apel","title":"Rapid induction of distinct stress responses after the release of singlet oxygen in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.014662","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["3 weeks"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Landsberg erecta"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["flu mutant","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["rosette leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["flu mutant","wild_type"]},{"name":"LIGHT DURATION","value":["120 minutes","30 minutes","60 minutes"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":454764,"accession":"P-10876-3"},{"id":454761,"accession":"P-10876-4"},{"id":454762,"accession":"P-10876-1"},{"id":454765,"accession":"P-10876-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":454763,"accession":"P-10876-5"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
