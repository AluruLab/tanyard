Experiment Description	We used the flu mutant of Arabidopsis to detail gene expression in response to singlet oxygen. The conditional flu mutant of Arabidopsis accumulates excess protochlorophyllide in the dark within chloroplast membranes that upon illumination acts as a photosensitizer and generates singlet oxygen. Immediately after the release of singlet oxygen mature flu plants stop growing, whereas seedlings bleach and die. Within the first 30 min after the release of singlet oxygen rapid changes in nuclear gene expression occur. Distinct sets of genes were activated that were different from those induced by other reactive oxygen species, superoxide or hydrogen peroxide. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves were harvested after 30 min, 1h, and 2 h of reillumination following a 8h dark period for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.  Plants were grown on soil for 3 weeks under continuous light at 90 mmol. m-2 . s-1. For each sample, the rosette leaves of five to six 3-week-old plants (before they start bolting) were collected for RNA extraction. Total RNAs from two separate biological experiments were pooled for the preparation of cDNA and the subsequent synthesis of biotin-labeled complementary RNA as recommended by Affymetrix.

Protocol Description	Plants were transferred to the dark for 8 h and rosette leaves were harvested at 30 min, 60 min, and 2 h after reillumination.	Plants were grown on soil for 3 weeks under continuous light at 90 mmol. m-2 . s-1	total RNA extraction was performed according to the guanidine-hydrochloride method as described in Melzer, S., Majewski, D. M. & Apel, K. (1990) Plant Cell 2, 953-961.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 20 ug total RNA (Eukaryotic Target Preparation, 2002, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 15 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400, protocol EukGE-WS2v4.	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CHP Analysis (ExpressionStat).
