After 3 days of germination, etiolated seedlings were transfered to light conditions in liquid media similar to previous one but without agar . After 5 hours, auxin (10 micromolar IAA) was added to all treated samples except to controls (Mock treatment). all samples were harvested after one-hour treatment and frozen for further RNA extraction. Aim of the project was to detect impact of exogenous auxin treatment  on each genotype"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Richard Sibout","role":"submitter","email":"rsibout@unil.ch"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":17121469,"authors":"Sibout R, Sukumar P, Hettiarachchi C, Holm M, Muday GK, Hardtke CS.","title":"Opposite root growth phenotypes of hy5 versus hy5 hyh mutants correlate with increased constitutive auxin signaling.","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.0020202","issue":11,"pages":"e202","publication":"PLoS Genet","volume":2,"year":2006,"status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["3 day"]},{"category":"BioSourceType","value":["frozen_sample"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia","Wassilewskija"]},{"category":"GeneticModification","value":["gene_knock_out"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["hy5 hyh double mutant","hy5-215 mutant","hyh mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"InitialTimePoint","value":["germination"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"provider","value":["Hardtke lab","Magnus Holm lab (Magnus Holm et al. 2002, Genes and Development)","Xing-Wang Deng lab (Ang et al, 1998, Mol.
