Experiment Description	Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings comprising hy5 single mutant , hyh single mutant, hy5 hyh double mutant and wild-type plants were germinated in the dark on agar medium on usual Murashig and Skoog medium (pH 5.8) without sucrose. After 3 days of germination, etiolated seedlings were transfered to light conditions in liquid media similar to previous one but without agar . After 5 hours, auxin (10 micromolar IAA) was added to all treated samples except to controls (Mock treatment). all samples were harvested after one-hour treatment and frozen for further RNA extraction. Aim of the project was to detect impact of exogenous auxin treatment  on each genotype

Protocol Description	Etiolated seedlings were germinated on Murashig and Skoog (MS) medium (on agar plates) without sucrose. 3 days after germination, seedling were transfered in liquid MS (in light) and harvested after 6 hours.	After 3 days of germination, etiolated seedlings were transfered to light conditions in liquid Murashig and Skoog medium without sucrose. After 5 hours, 10 microMolar auxin (IAA) was added to all treated samples except to controls (Mock treatment). Samples were harvested one-hour after treatment and frozen for further RNA extraction.	QIAGEN protocol for plants and fungi. Frozen seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen. 450ul of buffer RLT were added to 100mg of powder and the tube was centrifuged (15s,8000g). Lysate was added to 0.5 volume of ethanol and applied to RNeasy mini column and thus centrifuged (15s, 8000g). DNAse treatment was carried out according to the protocol. 700ul of buffer RW1 were added and the column was centrifuged (15s, 8000g) the column was centrifuged once to remove buffer RPE. Total RNA was eluted with 30 ul of rnase-free water 	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	Normalized signal intensities using generated using the Affymetrix MAS 5.0 default algorithm for each CEL file. The caluclation was performed using the RACE web site at University of Lausanne (http://race.unil.ch/). This software is described in: Psarros M, Heber S, Sick M, Thoppae G, Harshman K, Sick B.
