Experiment Description	Global gene expression patterns were compared among wild-type Col-0, teb, atr, teb atr of A. thaliana using shoot apices.	
Protocol Name	P-MEXP-109879	P-MEXP-16627	P-MEXP-109880	P-AFFY-2	P-MEXP-110298	P-AFFY-6	P-MEXP-114005	
Protocol Type	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	pool	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	
Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were sterilized in sterile water, kept 4C for 3-d, and sown on 0.3% (w/v) gellun gum plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, 0.5 g/L MES, pH 5.8, and 2g/L Suc. Plates were incubated for 14 days in growth chamber at 22C under continuous light (50 mmol photons m-2 s-1).	Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL, Cleveland, OH) and subsequently purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer`s instructions.	Leaves with visible petioles were removed from aerial parts of plants. And collected remaining parts from about 50 plants.	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Hybridization using the GeneChip Hybridization, Wash, and Stain Kit in a GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 for 16h, at 45?.	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	Using GeneSpring GX 7.3,  the values less than 0.01 were set to 0.01, and then data from each chip was normalized to the 50th percentile of values taken from that chip. Then, values of each gene were normalized to that of mean values for Col-0.1 and Col-0.2. After that, spread sheet was made, and comberted it to tab delimited text file.
