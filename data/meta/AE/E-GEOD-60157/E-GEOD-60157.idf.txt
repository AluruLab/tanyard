Comment[Submitted Name]	Bird Factors integrate positional signals to coordinate asymmetric cell division and cell fate
Experiment Description	We sorted for GFP+ cells using the enhancer trap J0571 with the UAS promoter driving the expression of different BIRD genes. Different genetic backgrounds are use and listed below. Seedlings were grown for 5 days.  J0571 and J0571-UAS-BIRDS sorted fluorecent cells were harvested for RNA extraction.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 250. ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity	Affy two-cycle labeling (raw 21-26) and one-cycle (everything else) labeling protocol	Standard Operating Procedure performed at the Duke Microarray Facility	Seedling roots, 5 days after germination, either protoplasted cells or tissue	Growth Media: Standard media for 5 days	Quiagen MicroRNAesy kit (total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instruction	Standard Operating Procedure performed at the Duke Microarray Facility
Protocol Type	normalization data transformation protocol	labelling protocol	hybridization protocol	sample treatment protocol	growth protocol	nucleic acid extraction protocol	array scanning protocol
