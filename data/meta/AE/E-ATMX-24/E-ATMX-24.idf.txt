Experiment Description	Umkirch-1/Umkirch-3 hybrid plants and their parents were grown at 23SD and then shifted to 16SD for five days. 10 plants were pooled in each of three sample replicates.								
Protocol Name	P-CAGE-25826	P-CAGE-25829	P-CAGE-25830	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown	P-AFFY-6				
Protocol Type	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction				
Protocol Description	Plants were grown at 23C (short days) for 27 days, then shifted to 16C (short days). Shoot apices were harvested before shift and five days after shift. Short day = 8 hrs light, 16 hrs dark.	Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy plant kit.	1Âµg starting RNA was used. Probes were labeled using the Message Amp II Biotin kit (Ambion).
