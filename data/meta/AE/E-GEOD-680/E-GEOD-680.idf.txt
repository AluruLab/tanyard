Protocol Type	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	
Protocol Description	Plants were grown in a Conviron chamber under continuous light with fluorescent lamps at 20oC and 50% - 70% relative humidity.	Total RNA was extracted using the Hot Borate Method [Stones et. al. PNAS vol 98 no 20: 11806-11811 (2001)]	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared using the ENZO BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Farmingdale, NY).	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
