Experiment Description	Microarray experiments were performed using Arabidopsis wild type plants (Col-0) and srk2dei triple knockout mutant to investigate the functions of ABA-activated protein kinases, SRK2D/SnRK2.2, SRK2E/OST1 and SRK2I/SnRK2.3. Transcription profiles of wild type and mutants were compared under ABA treatment or dehydration stress for 0 and 90 min. The srk2dei mutant was established by crossing T-DNA insertion mutants provided from Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center.

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-30527	P-MTAB-30528			
Protocol Description	Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on GM agar medium for 2-3 weeks in a controlled growth chamber. Then seedlings were harvested and treated with ABA or dehydration stress. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Arabidopsis seedlings (wild type and srk2dei) were grown on GM medium for three weeks. Then they were exposed to 50 uM ABA solution for ABA treatment, or placed on petri dishes for dehydration stress. Each sample name mean as follows; Col-cont means wild type (no treatment). Col-ABA means wild type treated with ABA for 90 min. Col-DH means wild type under dehydration stress for 90 min. dei-cont means srk2dei mutant (no treatment). dei-ABA means srk2dei mutant treated with ABA for 90 min. dei-DH means srk2dei mutant under dehydration stress for 90 min.
