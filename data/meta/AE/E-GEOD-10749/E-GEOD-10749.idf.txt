Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	
Protocol Description	For microarray analysis total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerâs protocol.	1 Â&#956;g of total RNA was linearly amplified and biotinylated using the One-Cycle Target Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Labelling and hybridization were conducted by the microarray facility of the Universitaetsklinikum Tuebingen, Germany.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
