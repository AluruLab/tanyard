We set up 24 experimental landscapes consisting of 2, 4, 8, or 16 patches where the total area was constrained to be equal. Plants that germinated outside the designated suitable patches were removed. In half of the landscapes – which we termed static – the top 2-3 mm of seeds and soil were removed from the surface of the suitable patches after 8 weeks of growth and reproduction. In the other half of the landscapes – which we termed dynamic – a number of Petri dishes, equivalent in size and number to the existing suitable patches, were distributed around the landscape at random, to catch dispersing seeds. The seeds collected by these two methods were cold-treated for one week while all patches were replenished with fresh substrate. Seeds were then returned to the surface of the new patches at the beginning of the next generation. Thus, in dynamic landscapes, seeds must disperse to have any chance of entering the next generation, while in static landscapes, only seeds that do not disperse have any chance of further propagation. After five generations of such selection, a single pod from approximately 70 individuals from each landscape was removed. Single individuals derived from such pods were reared under standardized conditions to measure several phenotypic characters, such as seed mass, height, presence of the erecta mutation, flowering time etc.","type":"specified_biomaterial_action","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":416106,"accession":"P-MTAB-4192","name":"P-MTAB-4192","text":"Flowers for DNA extraction from each population (? 50 plants\/population) and leaves from the parental accessions Cvi and Ler, were collected for DNA extraction.

The means and sum of squared deviations were calculated for each feature. The SAM d-statistic was calculated, which is similar to a t-statistic except that a constant (s0) was added to the denominator. This guards against large d-statistics for small mean differences between genotypes when the error is also small. To estimate the False Discovery Rate (FDR) the null distribution of the ordered d-statistic was determined. Labels on the 4 Cvi and 4 Ler arrays were shuffled as if the experiment was performed without keeping track of the genotypes. In each permutation, d-statistics were calculated for all features. 70 permutations were used to estimate the FDR. The d-statistics were sorted for each permutation and averaged to estimate the null distribution. The assumption here was that the ordered d-statistics for each feature come from the same ordered distribution. The FDR was then calculated at different thresholds by counting the number or ordered d-statistics greater than a threshold in both the original data and in each permuted data set. The average number of d-statistics that exceed a threshold among the permuted data sets was an estimate of the number of false positives. The false discovery rate was this number divided by the number of SFPs identified (d-statistics exceeding a threshold) in the original data and was chosen to be below 5% for identification of SFPs. Subsequently SFPs were used for bulk segregant analysis to identify allele frequency shifts between generations 1 and 5 of the experimental landscapes. The first step of bulk segregant mapping is to scale each SFP so that the difference between the two parental genotypes (Cvi and Ler) is 1 and the mean is 0. With each SFP ont eh same scale, homozygous Cvi genotypes = 0.5, heterozygous = 0, and Ler = -0.5. The allele frequency of any single SFP is noisy however an accurate estimate can be made by considering multiple SFPs along a region. We were interested in deviations from equal proportions of Cvi and Ler genotypes in a pool, an allele frequency of 0 on our scale. To identify these regions, the genotype of the Ler pool is subtracted from the Cvi pool. The resulting vector of allele frequency differences for each chromosome is then smoothed by loess.

Analysis scripts were adapted as follows. Since the parental accessions were Ler and Cvi and not Col, which is the basis of the targets located on the ATH1 Affymetrix Genechips®, two-tailed modified t-tests were performed instead of one-tailed. To minimize the possibility that identified SFPs represent duplications between Cvi and Ler accessions, potential SFP duplications were mapped using two-tailed t-test on previously published microarray data for Col\/Ler (1382 duplications) and Col\/Cvi (754 duplications) at the threshold used for mapping SFPs in Cvi\/Ler accessions. Of these duplications 1937 were unique and 1054 SFP markers matched in the Cvi\/Ler population and were thus removed from further analysis leaving a total of 26638 SFP markers for bulk segregant analysis."],"type":"bioassay_data_transformation","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null}]}}
