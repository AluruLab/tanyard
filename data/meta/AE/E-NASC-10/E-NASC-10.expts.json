We have chosen to study this by comparing mRNA populations from the axillary buds of the auxin over-responding, apically dominant axr3-1 mutant of Arabidopsis,with those from the axillary buds of the auxin resistant axr1-12 bushy mutant. Preliminary investigation using cDNA AFLP has been successful in identifying differentially expressed transcripts in the buds of these two genotypes, thus demonstrating the importance of this study, however this is a time consuming procedure. Axillary buds from axr3-1 are seen to arrest at an early stage when the buds are approximately 2mm long and harvested at this point. Buds of a similar size were harvested from axr1-12 plants and the RNA extracted using Qiagen columns.These two mRNA samples will represent the dormant and active buds to be comparedin this experiment. The plants from which these buds were harvested were grown in adjacent p40 trays in a plant growth room. Between two and three buds were harvested from each plant."}],"provider":[{"contact":"David J Craigon","role":"data_coder submitter","email":"david@arabidopsis.info"},{"contact":"Janet Higgins","role":"investigator","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"},{"contact":"Sally Ward","role":"biosource_provider","email":"spw6@york.ac.uk"},{"contact":"Joan Jotham","role":"investigator","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"},{"contact":"John Y Okyere","role":"investigator","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"GeneticModification","value":["induced_mutation"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["axr1-12","axr3-1"]},{"category":"NASC:StockCode","value":["N3076","N57504"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["axillary buds approx. 2 mm elongated"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"Genotype","value":["axr1-12","axr3-1"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":2,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":90334,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Scan"},{"id":143,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4"},{"id":90396,"accession":"NASCLabelProtocol:1"},{"id":20050,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Percentile"},{"id":480325,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:218"},{"id":385756,"accession":"P-MTAB-24020"},{"id":385755,"accession":"P-MTAB-24021"},{"id":385754,"accession":"P-MTAB-24019"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":2,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":2,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":2,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":2,"isderived":0}]}]}}
