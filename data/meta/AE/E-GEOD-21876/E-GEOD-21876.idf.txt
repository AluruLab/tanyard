Investigation Title	Transcriptional regulation of ROS controls the transition from proliferation to differentiation in the root							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptional regulation of ROS controls the transition from proliferation to differentiation in the root							
Experiment Description	We isolated the meristematic and elongation zones of Col-0, upb1-1 mutant and 35S::UPB1-3YFP/upb1-1 plants by micro-dissection and extracted RNA from each section independently. To identify genes that might mediate UPB1 function we conducted a series of microarray experiments. The spatial distribution of the UPB1 protein suggested that it might exert a different effect on gene expression in the meristematic and elongation zones. Therefore, we isolated the meristematic and elongation zones by micro-dissection and extracted RNA from each section independently. Total RNA was isolated from approximately 60 meristem- and elongation zones of Col-0, upb1-1 and 35S::UPB1-3YFP #2 6 day old plants. Two biological replicates were performed for each experiment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Signal<br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Samples were submitted to Duke Microarray Facility (Durham, NC) for hybridization to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.	Seeds were surface sterilized for 5 minutes in 30% Bleach and 0.02% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes. Seeds were rinsed 3 times with sterile water, stratified for 4ËšC for 2 days, then placed on standard media. Standard media is 1X Murashige and Skoog salt mixture, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH and seeds were planted at 5 seeds/cm in two rows.	MAS5	Samples were submitted to Duke Microarray Facility (Durham, NC) for hybridization to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.	Seedlings were grown for 6 days.  Roots were cut into the meristematic and elongation zone with a razor blade under microscope and collected into RNA extraction buffer.  Approximately 60 roots were collected per replicate, with two biological replicates being performed per sample.  Samples were briefly sonicated to disrupt the tissue.	Approximately 60 roots were collected per replicate.  Samples were briefly sonicated to disrupt the tissue.  RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen).	Fragmented cRNA probes were prepared using the two-cycle amplification protocol by Affymetrix.
