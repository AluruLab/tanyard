To identify genes that might mediate UPB1 function we conducted a series of microarray experiments. The spatial distribution of the UPB1 protein suggested that it might exert a different effect on gene expression in the meristematic and elongation zones. Therefore, we isolated the meristematic and elongation zones by micro-dissection and extracted RNA from each section independently. Total RNA was isolated from approximately 60 meristem- and elongation zones of Col-0, upb1-1 and 35S::UPB1-3YFP #2 6 day old plants. Two biological replicates were performed for each experiment."}],"provider":[{"contact":"HIRONAKA TSUKAGOSHI","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Hironaka Tsukagoshi","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Wolfgang Busch","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21074051,"authors":"Tsukagoshi H, Busch W, Benfey PN","title":"Transcriptional regulation of ROS controls transition from proliferation to differentiation in the root","doi":"10.1016\/j.cell.2010.10.020","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["6 days"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["35S::UPB1-3YFP #2\/upb1-1","upb1-1","wild_type"]},{"category":"growth media","value":["Standard media (1xMS, 1% Sucrose, 1% agarose)"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["root elongation zone","root meristem zone"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["35S::UPB1-3YFP #2\/upb1-1","upb1-1","wild_type"]},{"name":"ORGANISM PART","value":["root elongation zone","root meristem zone"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":445007,"accession":"P-GSE21876-8"},{"id":445004,"accession":"P-GSE21876-1"},{"id":445011,"accession":"P-GSE21876-2"},{"id":445009,"accession":"P-GSE21876-3"},{"id":445010,"accession":"P-GSE21876-4"},{"id":445006,"accession":"P-GSE21876-5"},{"id":445005,"accession":"P-GSE21876-6"},{"id":445008,"accession":"P-GSE21876-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
