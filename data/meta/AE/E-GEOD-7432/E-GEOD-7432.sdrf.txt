Control for the IAA treatment.:  Wild-type Col-0 seeds were surface-sterilized and deposited onto a Nylon membrane (Sefar filtration, 03-100/47) that had been previously autoclave-sterilized and laid on the surface of sterile AT plates. Seeds were stratified for three days at 4ÂºC in the dark, and then exposed to light for one hour at room temperature. Plates with seeds were placed in a vertical orientation and incubated for three days in the dark at 22ÂºC.  Seedlings were then sprayed with a 0.01% EtOH solution (mock treatment) under safe green light and incubated in the dark for four hours. 50 ml of RNAlater solution were then poured into the plates and the membranes with the seedlings were transferred to new plates containing 50 ml of fresh RNAlater solution. Using a razorblade, the roots were dissected from the hypocotyls while still submerged into the RNAlater solution, transferred to a microfuge tube and frozen at â80ÂºC.. Wild-type Arabidopsis seeds (Col-0) were germinated in the dark for 72 hours in sterile vertical plates. Seedlings were sprayed with 0.01% EtOH (mock treatment) under safe green light and incubated for 4 additional hours in the dark.

IAA treatment.:  ein2-5 mutant seeds were surface-sterilized and deposited onto a Nylon membrane (Sefar filtration, 03-100/47) that had been previously autoclave-sterilized and laid on the surface of sterile AT plates. Seeds were stratified for three days at 4ÂºC in the dark, and then exposed to light for one hour at room temperature. Plates with seeds were placed in a vertical orientation and incubated for three days in the dark at 22ÂºC. Seedlings were then sprayed with 1 microMolar IAA in a 0.01% EtOH solution under safe green light and incubated in the dark for four hours. 50 ml of RNAlater solution were then poured into the plates and the membranes with the seedlings were transferred to new plates containing 50 ml of fresh RNAlater solution. Using a razorblade, the roots were dissected from the hypocotyls while still submerged into the RNAlater solution, transferred to a microfuge tube and frozen at â80ÂºC..

Plates with seeds were placed in a vertical orientation and incubated for three days in the dark at 22ÂºC.  Hydrocarbon-free air supplemented with 10ppm of ethylene was flushed through the plates with seedlings for four hours. 50 ml of RNAlater solution were then poured into the plates and the membranes with the seedlings were transferred to new plates containing 50 ml of fresh RNAlater solution.
