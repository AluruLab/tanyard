For this purpose, three independent amiR-tor lines (amiR-tor9, amiR-tor17 and amiR-tor 20) and EV lines 3 and 6 days after EST- or non-induction were used for expression profile analysis using Affymetrix microarray. Two weeks-old transgenic seedlings were transferred to MS plate with 20ÂµM estradiol to induce the overexpression of amiR-tor (consequently, repression of AtTOR levels) under the control of an estradiol-(EST) inducible promoter. Identically treated wild-type Col-0 and pER8 empty-vector (EV) transformed seedlings were served as controls. Seedlings were harvested after 3 and 6 (amiR-tor lines) days. genetic modification"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Camila Caldana","role":"submitter","email":"camila.caldana@bioetanol.org.br"},{"contact":"Patrick Giavalisco","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Camila Caldana","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"cultivar","value":["Arabidopsis Col-0 background, inducible artificial micro RNA"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedlings"]},{"category":"variation","value":["amiR-tor 17","amiR-tor 20","amiR-tor 9","WT (Empty Vector)"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"TREATMENT","value":["3 days estradiol-treated","3 days non-treated","6 days estradiol-treated","6 days non-treated"]},{"name":"VARIATION","value":["amiR-tor 17","amiR-tor 20","amiR-tor 9","WT (Empty Vector)"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":16,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":706907,"accession":"P-GSE38878-7"},{"id":706909,"accession":"P-GSE38878-6"},{"id":706910,"accession":"P-GSE38878-5"},{"id":706911,"accession":"P-GSE38878-4"},{"id":706908,"accession":"P-GSE38878-8"},{"id":706906,"accession":"P-GSE38878-1"},{"id":706913,"accession":"P-GSE38878-2"},{"id":706912,"accession":"P-GSE38878-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0}]}]}}
