Comment[Submitted Name]	Identification of ORB1 target genes using inducible overexpression system
Experiment Description	The aim was to identify  genes associated to the  down-regulation TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) pathway in Arabidopsis. For this purpose, three independent amiR-tor lines (amiR-tor9, amiR-tor17 and amiR-tor 20) and EV lines 3 and 6 days after EST- or non-induction were used for expression profile analysis using Affymetrix microarray. Two weeks-old transgenic seedlings were transferred to MS plate with 20ÂµM estradiol to induce the overexpression of amiR-tor (consequently, repression of AtTOR levels) under the control of an estradiol-(EST) inducible promoter. Identically treated wild-type Col-0 and pER8 empty-vector (EV) transformed seedlings were served as controls. Seedlings were harvested after 3 and 6 (amiR-tor lines) days. genetic modification

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 GCRMA signal	performed by Atlas Biolabs	Transgenic amiR-tor seeds were surfaced sterilized and germinated in MS plates with hygromycin at continuous light.	The data were analyzed with GCRMA (Wu et al., 2004).	performed by Atlas Biolabs	Two weeks-old transgenic seedlings were transferred to MS plate with 20µM estradiol to induce the overexpression of amiR-tor (consequently, repression of AtTOR levels) under the control of an estradiol-(EST) inducible promoter. Identically treated wild-type Col-0 and pER8 empty-vector (EV) transformed seedlings were served as controls. All the genotypes were also transferred to MS plate without EST as an additional control. Seedlings were harvested after 0, 3 and 6 (amiR-tor lines) days.	RNA extraction performed using Rneasy Plant MiniKit (Qiagene)	Labling procedure performed using MessageAmpTM II-Biotin Enhanced Kit
