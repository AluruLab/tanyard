Experiment Description	Gene expression profile in Arabidopsis stems of T-DNA insertion lines Atwrky12-1 and Atwrky12-2 were compared with Columbia wild-type plants at 45 days after germination.

Protocol Type	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	specified_biomaterial_action	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation
Protocol Description	"Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type Col-0 and T-DNA insert lines were grown in growth chambers at 22 oC under long day condition (16 hrs light). Stems of 45 days old plants were used for all experiments.<br><br><br>(Parameters: start time = 45, time unit = days, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C, media = Potting soil mix)"	"Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent, treated with DNaseI (Ambion), and column purified with an RNeasy MinElute CleanUp kit (Qiagen).<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"	"For Arabidopsis, 1/3 of the bottom part of stems of Atwrky12-1 and Atwrky12-2 homozygous plants and Columbia wild type plants were used."	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	The normalized data was obtained by using RMA. All chips were normalized together using robust multichip average.  Median polish was used for the probe level summary.
