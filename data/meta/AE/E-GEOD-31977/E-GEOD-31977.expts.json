As toxicity is a major factor leading to root growth inhibition in plants.  However, the molecular mechanisms of plants in response to As has not been extensively characterized.  In this study, Arabidopsis ecotypes that are As-tolerant (Col-0) and -sensitive (Ws-2) were used to conduct a transcriptome analysis of the response to As (V).  To begin elucidating the molecular basis of As toxicity and tolerance in Arabidopsis, seedlings of Col-0 and Ws-2 were subjected to As treatment.   The root elongation rate of Col-0 was significantly higher than that of Ws-2 when exposed to As.  The tolerant ecotype (Col-0) demonstrated lower accumulation of As when compared to the responses observed in the sensitive Ws-2.  Subsequently, the effect of As exposure on genome-wide gene expression was examined in the two ecotypes.  Comparative analysis of microarray data identified groups of genes with common and specific responses to As between Col-0 and Ws-2.  The genes related to heat responses and oxidative stresses belonged to common responses, indicating conserved stress-associated changes across two ecotypes.  The majority of specific responsive genes were those encoding heat shock proteins, heat shock factors, ubiquitin and transporters.  The data suggested that metal transport and maintenance of protein structure may be important mechanisms for toxicity and tolerance to As.  This study presents comprehensive surveys of global transcriptional regulation and identifies stress- and tolerance-associated genes in response to As. Comparison of Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 and Ws-2 in response to As with the Affymetrix GeneChip were performed by the Affymetrix Gene Expression Service Lab (<a href=\"http:\/\/ipmb.sinica.edu.tw\/affy\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/ipmb.sinica.edu.tw\/affy\/<\/a>), supported by Academia Sinica, Taiwan"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Chung-Yi Lin","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Tsai-Lien Huang","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Po-Yu Chen","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Guan-Ru Zeng","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Hao-Jen Huang","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Shih-Feng Fu","role":"submitter","email":"sffuplant@cc.ncue.edu.tw"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":24734953,"authors":"Fu SF, Chen PY, Nguyen QT, Huang LY, Zeng GR, Huang TL, Lin CY, Huang HJ","title":"Transcriptome profiling of genes and pathways associated with arsenic toxicity and tolerance in Arabidopsis"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["4 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0","Ws-2"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["arsenic","none"]},{"name":"dose","value":["100 micromolar","200 micromolar"]},{"name":"ecotype","value":["Col-0","Ws-2"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":15,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1135961,"accession":"P-GSE31977-4"},{"id":1135963,"accession":"P-GSE31977-3"},{"id":1135962,"accession":"P-GSE31977-2"},{"id":1135956,"accession":"P-GSE31977-1"},{"id":1135957,"accession":"P-GSE31977-8"},{"id":1135958,"accession":"P-GSE31977-7"},{"id":1135959,"accession":"P-GSE31977-6"},{"id":1135960,"accession":"P-GSE31977-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":15,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":15,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":15,"isderived":0}]}]}}
