Investigation Title	Gene expression data from Arabidopsis C24 wild-type and ros1-1 seedlings.					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Gene expression data from Arabidopsis C24 wild-type and ros1-1 seedlings.
Experiment Description	We carried out a microarray experiment by using Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genechips in order to identify genes that show reduced expression in ros1-1 plants. 2 samples examined: C24 wild-type and ros1-1 mutant (in C24 background).

Protocol Name	P-GSE52669-1	P-GSE52669-4	P-GSE52669-5	P-GSE52669-2	P-GSE52669-3	P-GSE52669-6
Protocol Description	Microarray data were extracted from scanned GeneChip images and analyzed by use of Microarray Suite version 5.0.1. Target value (TGT value) was set to 500 global scaling. ID_REF =  VALUE = Signal ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M) DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol.	The Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 genome array GeneChips were used and hybridization, washing, and staining were carried out as directed in the manufacturerâ€™s manual.	Seedlings were grown om MS medium for 15 days at 22 °C with a cycle of 16 hr of light and 8 hr of darkness.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	GeneChips were scanned using HP GeneArray Scanner G2500A.
