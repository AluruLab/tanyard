Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = dchip2008 intensity value<br>ABS_CALL = 	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on a GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	The seeds of the indicated genotype were surface steriled, planted on an MS plate, and grown at 23Â°C under long day (16h light, 8h dark) conditions for ten days before harvest.	Gcos1.4 (GeneChip Operating Software) was used for single array analysis. Invariant set Normalization and Model-base Expression index in dchip2008 package were used for further expression analysis.	The reads were aligned to the TAIR9 assembly using the ELAND extended program (Illumina) allowing up to two mismatches. The MASC program was used to shift the reads and convert the data to WIG format. WIG files were visualized with the Integrated Genome Browser (IGB).	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.	No treatment applied.	Nuclear lysates were clarified from sonicated nuclei, and crosslinked histone-DNA complexes were isolated with antibody. DNA was purified after reverse crosslinking. Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the single end DNA Sample Kit (Part# 0801-0303). After adapter ligation, DNA was size-fractionated to obtain 300bp fragments from an agarose gel. The library was PCRed for 18 cycles and gel purified before sequencing.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
