Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Log2 GCRMA normalized signal	Array scanning was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix) by the  Affymetrix Microarray Core Facility of the University of Tennessee.	cDNA samples were hybridized to the Affymetrix ATH1 array (July 01, 2002) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix) by the  Affymetrix Microarry Core Facility of the University of Tennessee. Probe set ID, Locus and Description refer to the Arabidopsis thaliana genome release TAIR 9 (June 19, 2009).		Polysome gradient and RNA purification were carried out essentially as decribed in Kim et al. (2007) Genome Biology 8:R60 (PMID 17439654). The top 6 fractions were pooled as non-polysomal (NP), and the bottom 6 fractions were pooled as polysomal (PL).	Harvest method: Under room light, flood seedlings with liquid Nitrogen and scrape off into liquid nitrogen with spatula; Timing: 4 hours after light on.	Medium: GM medium with 1% sucrose and 0.8% agar, in petri plates wrapped with parafilm that was pierced to allow gas exchange; Light: 16 h long day, from fluorescent bulbs at ~80umole/m2/second; Temperature: 22oC.	cDNA were generated and labeled according to the standard protocol by the  Affymetrix Microarray Core Facility of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.	Data were GCRMA normalized.	Data were GCRMA normalized. TL states (Log(2)[PL/NP]) were calculated (=Log(2)PL - Log(2)NP).
