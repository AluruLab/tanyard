Protocol Description	RNA was extracted from 25 pooled shoot apices from corresponding samples using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Plants were grown at 27ï¾ºC or 23ï¾ºC in short days for 4 weeks and the meristem tissue along with young leaves was used for RNA extraction. <br>(Parameters: start time = 4, time unit = weeks, temperature unit = C, media = Soil). Apices from 25 plants per genotype/treatment were pooled and RNA was extracted	Plants grown at 23ï¾ºC or 27ï¾ºC short days for 4 weeks were carefully dissected and the meristematic tissue along with young leaves was used for RNA extraction and subsequent array hybridisation.
