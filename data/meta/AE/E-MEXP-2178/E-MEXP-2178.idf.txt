Protocol Type	specified_biomaterial_action	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation
Protocol Description	Leaves (ca. 80 mg) were harvested and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen	"Seeds were sown directly on soil and pots were placed in medium day conditions (12h light 150 uA.cm-2, 22 C, 60% humidity, 12h dark 18 C, 60% humidity).<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)"	"Total RNA were extracted with the RNeasy PLant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA were removed using the DNAse I (RNAse free) from Ambion (Applied Biosystem) and the RNA were purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Complete removal of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA was checked by PCR on diluted RNA and RNA quality was assessed on the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) prior to reverse transcription with random primers (Superscript III, Invitrogen). <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = PCR)"	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
