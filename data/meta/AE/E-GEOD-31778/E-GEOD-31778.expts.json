Suppression of AhNAS2 expression by RNAi resulted in strongly reduced root NA accumulation and a concomitant decrease in root-to-shoot-translocation of Zn but not of other micronutrients. Few secondary effects on the root transcriptome were detected by microarray analysis. Vegetatively propagated clones of A. halleri wildtype plants and a line with strong suppression of AhNAS2 were grown hydroponically for weeks in two different media (control Hoagland and 10 µM Zn2+ added). Roots were harvested and analyzed. Three plants were pooled for one sample. Three independent experiments were performed."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Stephan Clemens","role":"submitter","email":"stephan.clemens@uni-bayreuth.de"},{"contact":"Stephan Clemens","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Ulrich Deinlein","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":22374395,"authors":"Deinlein U, Weber M, Schmidt H, Rensch S, Trampczynska A, Hansen TH, Husted S, Schjoerring JK, Talke IN, Krämer U, Clemens S","title":"Elevated nicotianamine levels in Arabidopsis halleri roots play a key role in zinc hyperaccumulation"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["5 week"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Langelsheim"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["NAS2-RNAi line","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis halleri ssp halleri"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["none","sulfate zinc"]},{"name":"dose","value":["10 micromolar"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["NAS2-RNAi line","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1135944,"accession":"P-GSE31778-6"},{"id":1135947,"accession":"P-GSE31778-2"},{"id":1135946,"accession":"P-GSE31778-3"},{"id":1135945,"accession":"P-GSE31778-4"},{"id":1135943,"accession":"P-GSE31778-5"},{"id":1135942,"accession":"P-GSE31778-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
