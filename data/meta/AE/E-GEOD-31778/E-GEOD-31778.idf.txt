Investigation Title	AhNAS2 suppression in Arabidopsis halleri roots					
Comment[Submitted Name]	AhNAS2 suppression in Arabidopsis halleri roots					
Experiment Description	The model Zn hyperaccumulators Arabidopsis halleri and Noccaea caerulescens share elevated nicotianamine synthase (NAS) expression relative to non-accumulators among a core of alterations in metal homeostasis gene expression. Suppression of AhNAS2 expression by RNAi resulted in strongly reduced root NA accumulation and a concomitant decrease in root-to-shoot-translocation of Zn but not of other micronutrients. Few secondary effects on the root transcriptome were detected by microarray analysis. Vegetatively propagated clones of A. halleri wildtype plants and a line with strong suppression of AhNAS2 were grown hydroponically for weeks in two different media (control Hoagland and 10 µM Zn2+ added). Roots were harvested and analyzed. Three plants were pooled for one sample. Three independent experiments were performed.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA signal intensity	Hybridized arrays were washed and stained in an Affymetrix Fluidics Station FS450, and the fluorescent signals were measured with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.	cRNA products were hybridized to the array for 16 h at 45C in a rotating chamber.	RNA was extracted from homogenized A. halleri root tissue with Trizol (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	250 ng of total RNA, purified with RNeasy Mini columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's directions, were used to generate double-stranded cDNA and subsequently biotin-labeled cRNA. The length of the cRNA products was assessed using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA)	CEL files from the Affymetrix microarray hybridization were processed by use of the R program and Bioconductor packages (Gentleman et al., 2004). The Robust Multi-chip Average (RMA) normalization was performed using the default settings of the corresponding R function (Irizarry et al., 2003). To estimate the amount of expressed mRNAs, the present call information of the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test (PMA values) was computed with the 'affy' package (Gautier et al., 2004). Hybridization data from three biological replicates were generated for each Langelsheim wild-type and RNAi line 1-2.
