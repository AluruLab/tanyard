Protocol Description	The data were analzyed using the Affymetrix Command Console v3.2.4 using the RMA algorithm. ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA signal	Single stranded amplified RNA (aRNA) was prepared from 500 ng of total RNA as per the Affymetrix 3' IVT Express kit manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).	12.5Î¼g of fragmented end-labeled aRNA was hybridized for 16 hours at 45°C to Arabidopsis Genome ATH1 arrays for five cycles in 2x SSC and three cylces in 0.1x SSC.	Seedlings were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 (5Î¼L at an OD600 1.5) and cocultivated for 8 hours.	Arabidopsis seedlings were spotted onto semi-solid Murashige-Skoog plates for germination and growth in 16/8 hour light-dark periods with 24/18 degrees celsius. At 3 weeks, seedlings were transferd into hydroponic system and sustained by liquid MS media.	Qiagen Plant RNeasy column based extraction was performed according to the manufacturere's protocol.	GeneChips were scanned using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.
