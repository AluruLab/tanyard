Protocol Name	P-MTAB-595	P-MTAB-594	P-AFFY-2	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown	P-AFFY-6	P-MTAB-596	
Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	grow	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	
Protocol Description	For 24 hour germinating seeds, total RNA was extracted using an RNAaqueous kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Wild type (Col-0 ecotype) seeds were grown in liquid medium (0.5x MS salts, 1x Gamborg's vitamins, pH 5.7) supplemented with 2.5 uM EL6, 2.5 uM GR24 or DMSO (control) on a rotary shaker at 50 rpm at 25 C under continuous light.  Three biological replicates for each condition were performed.<br>(Parameters: start time = 24, time unit = hours, min temperature = 25, temperature unit = C, media = liquid 0.5x MS medium)	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	Advanced data analysis was performed in Genespring 7.3.1.  A per-chip normalization was performed using the 50th percentile of all measurements in order to adjust total signal intensity in each chip. Experimental filtering was performed for presence or marginal in all gene chips.  For each experimental condition, 3 biological replicates were performed.  RMA normalized values expressed as log base2.
