This high-resolution dataset shows how different cell types are predisposed to react to auxin with discrete transcriptional responses. The sensitivity provided by the analysis lies in the ability to detect cell-type specific responses diluted in organ-level analyses. This dataset provides a novel resource to examine how auxin, a widespread signal in plant development, influences differentiation and patterning in the plant through tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. To analyze the effect of auxin in separate spatial domains of the root, early transcriptional changes in response to auxin treatment were assayed by means of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and microarray analysis in four tissues of the Arabidopsis root (wild type Col-0). The samples covered inner and outer as well as proximal and distal cell populations; including the stele (reporter line pWOL::GFP), xylem-pole (xp) pericycle (enhancer trap line E3754), epidermis\/lateral root cap (reporter line pWER::GFP) and columella (enhancer trap line PET111). One-week-old seedlings of the individual lines were treated with auxin (two hours, 5ÂµM indole-3-acetic acid [IAA]) or mock treated, after which roots were harvested and cells were dissociated by cell wall digestion (1 hour; including 5uM IAA) . GFP-positive cells were sorted and used for microarray transcriptome analysis (as in Bargmann and Birnbaum, Plant Phys. 2010). For comparison, transcriptional responses to auxin were also assayed in intact (undigested) roots."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Bastiaan Otto Robert Bargmann","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Kenneth D Birnbaum","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Bastiaan O Bargmann","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["1 week"]},{"category":"cultivar","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["columella","epidermis","pericycle","stele","whole root"]},{"category":"strain","value":["E3754","PET111","pWER::GFP","pWOL::GFP"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["indole-3-acetic acid","none"]},{"name":"dose","value":["5 micromolar"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["columella","epidermis","pericycle","stele","whole root"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":30,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1127054,"accession":"P-GSE35580-6"},{"id":1127055,"accession":"P-GSE35580-5"},{"id":1127053,"accession":"P-GSE35580-7"},{"id":1127058,"accession":"P-GSE35580-2"},{"id":1127052,"accession":"P-GSE35580-1"},{"id":1127056,"accession":"P-GSE35580-4"},{"id":1127057,"accession":"P-GSE35580-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":30,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":30,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":30,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":30,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":30,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":30,"isderived":0}]}]}}
