Investigation Title	Transcriptome of the exo70A1 mutant					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome of the exo70A1 mutant					
Experiment Description	We characterized two independent insertional mutants of the AtEXO70A1 gene, encoding a subunit of the exocyst complex. Homozygous mutants exhibit a suite of phenotypic defects: polar growth of root hairs and stigmatic papillae is disturbed; organs are generally smaller; plants show loss of apical dominance and an indeterminate growth where instead of floral meristems new lateral inflorescences are initiated in a reiterative manner; exo70A1 mutants have dramatically reduced fertility. These results suggest that EXO70A1 is involved in cell and organ morphogenesis.  Keywords: Expression profiling by array 4 samples were used in this experiment
