The stress is created through inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis. Isoxaben is a drug that inhibits cellulose biosynthesis in a dose dependent manner. We used a concentration of 600 nM isoxaben which should inhibit appr. 80% of cellulose biosynthesis. We performed a time course experiment where seedlings were treated for 36h with isoxaben and in parrallel untreated seedlings were grown. At 8 different timepoints treated and untreated samples were harvested."}],"provider":[{"contact":"thorsten hamann","role":"submitter","email":"thamann@stanford.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19036034,"authors":"Hamann T, Bennett M, Mansfield J, Somerville C.","title":"Identification of cell-wall stress as a hexose-dependent and osmosensitive regulator of plant responses","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-313X.2008.03744.x","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["6 day"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["isoxaben","none"]},{"name":"dose","value":["600 nanomolar","Unspecified"]},{"name":"sampling time point","value":["0 hour","12 hour","18 hour","20 hour","24 hour","36 hour","4 hour","8 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":16,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":143,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4"},{"id":79337,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4[]"},{"id":504261,"accession":"P-MEXP-24223"},{"id":77,"accession":"P-AFFY-2"},{"id":504260,"accession":"P-MEXP-24224"},{"id":79789,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-[]"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":504262,"accession":"P-MEXP-24225"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
