Experiment Description	We are interested in understanding how plants respond to cell wall stress. The stress is created through inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis. Isoxaben is a drug that inhibits cellulose biosynthesis in a dose dependent manner. We used a concentration of 600 nM isoxaben which should inhibit appr. 80% of cellulose biosynthesis. We performed a time course experiment where seedlings were treated for 36h with isoxaben and in parrallel untreated seedlings were grown. At 8 different timepoints treated and untreated samples were harvested.

Protocol Description	For expression profiling experiments 25mg (per flask) of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia seeds were surface sterilised with 70% ethanol and 5% calciumhypochloride for 45 minutes,  then cold treated for 3 days at 4º celsius.  They were grown for exactly 6 days in media containing 1% sucrose and 1/2 strength MS and pH adjusted to 5.7 using 1M KOH, on a shaker at 180 rpm under continuous fluorescent light (75µmol m-2s-1).    	At the start of treatment, media in the flasks was exchanged either against fresh media containing 600nM Isoxaben or fresh media without isoxaben. Samples (consisting of the content of one flask) were harvested from treated and untreated material at the following timepoints: 0h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 18h, 20h, 24h, 36h Upon harvest, plant material was washed with dd H2O, dried and frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Samples were stored at -80 degrees celsius until further processing. 	For isolation of total RNA samples were ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Subsequently total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit by following the kits instructions. 	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 		Title: Fluidics Station Protocol.
