Investigation Title	Expression data from WT, camta1/2, camta1/3, camta2/3, camta1/2/3 mutants						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from WT, camta1/2, camta1/3, camta2/3, camta1/2/3 mutants						
Experiment Description	CAMTA3 is known to be involved in regulation of induction of early cold-responsive genes, CBF1 and CBF2 at cold conditions and of suppression of SA production at warm temperature. Considering a functional redundancy of CAMTA family members in both warm and cold conditions, high-order of camta mutants, camta double and triple mutants, were generated and used to determined the effects of their regulation using microarray analysis. Global gene expression profile of WT and camta mutants was compared with the plants at warm temperature or at cold condition, 4°C for 24 hrs.
