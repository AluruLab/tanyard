Interestingly, a number of these mutants exhibited altered developmental characteristics in response to exogenous sucrose supply, such as bleaching of the cotyledons.  A preliminary microarray experiment has already been conducted on one of the mutants, acn1-2.  The gene expression analysis was done using 3 day-old seedlings of acn1-2 and the parent, Col-7, which were germinated on agar plates with and without exogenous sucrose.  A cross-comparison of acn1-2 and Col-7 revealed that the expression of a number of carbohydrate responsive genes was altered in the mutant.  The request for further microarray analysis is to confirm this result.
