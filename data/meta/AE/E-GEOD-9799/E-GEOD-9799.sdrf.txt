GSE9799GSM246375	Cardamine sp. SIM-2007	Chasmogamous flower:  This data was calibrated by gDNA hybridization of Accession no. GSM246369 in GEO.. Cardamine kokaiensis Yahara (Brassicaceae) is an annual cleistogamous herb that grows only near the Kokai River, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan (36Â°1' N, 140Â°0' E). This plant was discovered by T. Yahara (Kyushu University, Japan) and has not been described yet. However, this plant will be described this species name in the near future (Yahara in preparation). After the plants were self-pollinated and cultivated for four generations, the single descendant seeds were used in experiments. The chilling treatments were performed at 4Â°C in darkness after germination for 14 days. The first flowers of plants produced CH flowers.
