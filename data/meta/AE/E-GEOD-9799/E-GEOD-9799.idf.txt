Experiment Description	The annual cleistogamous herb Cardamine kokaiensis is an endemic plant along the Kokai River in Japan. We examined the differences in gene expression patterns among cleistogamous (CL), intermediate (INT), and chasmogamous (CH) flower by cross-species microarray analysis using an Arabidopsis thaliana Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide microarray (GeneChip ATH1). We then discuss the molecular basis of the evolution of cleistogamy. Our results help to clarify the molecular basis of the evolution of plant mating systems that depend on environmental conditions.

Nagano, Saori Miyazaki, Minoru Kubo, Taku Demura, Hiroo Fukuda, Satoki Sakai, Mitsuyasu Hasebe Experiment Overall Design: gDNA hybridyzation data was used to calibration of cross-species microarray using Affymetrix ATH1. CH, INT, and CL flowers of C. kokaiensis were induced the chilling treatment before germination for 14 days or after germination for 14 or 28 days, respectively. We performed two biological replications per flower. Data analysis was conducted according to Hammond et al. (2005) that described the methods of calibration by gDNA hybridization.

Protocol Description	A primordium of a first inflorescence with primordia of the first to eighth flowers was collected from each plant when the first flower primordium was visible. We collected 160 inflorescence primordia and placed them in the same microtube. The total RNA of sample was extracted using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Japan). The quality and quantity of total RNA were checked using an RNA Nano Labchip and 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA).	Total genomic DNA was extracted from 100mg of C. kokaiensis leaf tissue no chilling treatment using a DNeasy Plant mini kit (QIAGEN Ltd, Crawley, UK).	According to the manufacturer's instructions (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx).	Genomic DNA (1ug) was labeled by 500 ng using the BioPrime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to Hammond et al. (2005). The Total labeled DNA from 1ug purified Nucleotide Removal kit (QIAGEN Ltd).	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
