We examined the differences in gene expression patterns among cleistogamous (CL), intermediate (INT), and chasmogamous (CH) flower by cross-species microarray analysis using an Arabidopsis thaliana Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide microarray (GeneChip ATH1). We then discuss the molecular basis of the evolution of cleistogamy. Our results help to clarify the molecular basis of the evolution of plant mating systems that depend on environmental conditions. CITATION: Ecogenomics of cleistogamous and chasmogamous flowering: genome-wide gene expression patterns from cross-species microarray analysis in Cardamine kokaiensis (Brassicaceae); Journal of Ecology 2008; Shin-Ichi Morinaga, Atsushi J. Nagano, Saori Miyazaki, Minoru Kubo, Taku Demura, Hiroo Fukuda, Satoki Sakai, Mitsuyasu Hasebe Experiment Overall Design: gDNA hybridyzation data was used to calibration of cross-species microarray using Affymetrix ATH1. CH, INT, and CL flowers of C. kokaiensis were induced the chilling treatment before germination for 14 days or after germination for 14 or 28 days, respectively. We performed two biological replications per flower. Data analysis was conducted according to Hammond et al. (2005) that described the methods of calibration by gDNA hybridization."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Shin-Ichi Morinaga","role":"submitter","email":"smoriscb@mbox.nc.kyushu-u.ac.jp"}],"bibliography":[{"authors":"Shin-Ichi Morinaga, Atsushi J.
