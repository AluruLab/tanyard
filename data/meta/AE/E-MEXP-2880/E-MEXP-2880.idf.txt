Experiment Description	We analyzed changes in gene expression of Arabidopsis in response to 2 mM formaldehyde (HCHO) stimulation using cDNA microarray in the present study. The aim of our study was to identify HCHO-responsive genes and clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of Arabidopsis to HCHO stress.

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-16562	P-MTAB-16563	P-MTAB-16564	P-MTAB-16565	P-MTAB-16566	P-MTAB-16567
Protocol Description	Total RNA (1 ﾵg to 15 ﾵg) or mRNA (0.2 ﾵg to 2 ﾵg) is first reverse transcribed using a T7-Oligo(dT) Promoter Primer in the first-strand cDNA synthesis reaction. Following RNase H-mediated second-strand cDNA synthesis, the double-stranded cDNA is purified and serves as a template in the subsequent in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction. The IVT reaction is carried out in the presence of T7 RNA Polymerase and a biotinylated nucleotide analog/ribonucleotide mix for complementary RNA (cRNA) amplification and biotin labeling. The biotinylated cRNA targets are then cleaned up, fragmented, and hybridized to GeneChip expression arrays.(Parameters: Amount of nucleic acid labeled = 15, Amplification = none, Mass unit = Micro gram)	Raw CEL files are normalized using the MAS5 algorithm.The single array analysis generates two characteristic values: the signal value which assigns a relative abundance to the transcript, and the p-value which indicates whether the signal is reliably detected or not.	TRIzol Reagent from Invitrogen Life Technologies has been used to isolate total RNA from Arabidopsis and poly-A mRNA has been successfully isolated using QIAGENﾒs Oligotex products. (Parameters: Extracted product = polyA_RNA, Amplification = none)	Both formaldehyde-treated sample and control sample were mixtures of seedlings treated for 0.5 h, 2 h, 4 h and 17 h.	0.5 g of Arabidopsis seedlings were dipped into 2 mM HCHO solution (50 ml) containing 5 mM KHCO3 and 0.1% MES for 0.5 h, 2 h, 4 h and 17 h under the same conditions. The plants treated in the same solution without HCHO were used as the control.	Sterilized seeds were initially geminated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar medium (pH 5.7) containing 1% sucrose and grown in a growth chamber at 25oC under constant light (100 mol m-2 s-1). Two weeks later, the seedlings were transferred to the same fresh medium and grown under the same conditions for another two weeks. (Parameters: start time = 4, time unit = weeks, min temperature = 25, temperature unit = C, media =  Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar medium (pH 5.7))
