Experiment Description	Dark grown Arabidopsis seedlings (Columbia gl1) were grown in the dark at 23Â°C for 4 days before adding 90 mM sucrose for 6h.  Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia glabra (gl1-1) was used in this study. Seeds were sterilized with diluted bleach (10 min incubation in 1.7% sodium hypochlorite, rinsing and washing thoroughly in sterile water), and incubated in 2.5 ml liquid growing medium [Murashige-Skoog (MS) half strength solution] in 6-well plates (fully aerobic, with shaking). Plates were incubated in the darkness at 4Â°C for 2 days and finally transferred to 23Â°C for 4 days before the sugar treatments (with 90 mM sucrose, lasting 6h). Two independent, replicated experiments were performed for sucrose treatments. Each independent experiment consisted of four replicated seedlings cultures, pooled after RNA extraction.  Experiment Overall Design: AIR EXPERIMENT 1: Control without added sucrose Experiment Overall Design: AIR EXPERIMENT 2: Control without added sucrose Experiment Overall Design: Sucrose 90 mM, 6h treatment in the dark, Biological Replicate 1 Experiment Overall Design: Sucrose 90 mM, 6h treatment in the dark, Biological Replicate 2

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia glabra (gl1-1) was used in this study. Seeds were sterilized with diluted bleach (10 min incubation in 1.7% sodium hypochlorite, rinsing and washing thoroughly in sterile water), and incubated in 2.5 ml liquid growing medium [Murashige-Skoog (MS) half strength solution] in 6-well plates. Plates were incubated in the darkness at 4Â&deg;C for 2 days and finally transferred to 23Â&deg;C for 4 days before the sugar treatments. Two independent, replicated experiments were performed for sucrose treatments. Each independent experiment consisted of four replicated seedlings cultures, pooled after RNA extraction.	Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia glabra were grown for 4 days in the dark at 23Â&deg;C in multiwell plates containing half-strenght murashige skoog medium without added sucrose. Sample was subsequently kept for 6h under the same conditions with addition of 90 mM sucrose(shaking, thus aerobic).	Total RNA was extracted from the seedlings samples using the Ambion RNAqueous extraction kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA). RNA quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry.	RNA was processed for use on Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) as as described in the Affymetrix technical manual.
