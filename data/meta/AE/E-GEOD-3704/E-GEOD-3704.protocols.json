Seeds were sterilized with diluted bleach (10 min incubation in 1.7% sodium hypochlorite, rinsing and washing thoroughly in sterile water), and incubated in 2.5 ml liquid growing medium [Murashige-Skoog (MS) half strength solution] in 6-well plates. Plates were incubated in the darkness at 4Â°C for 2 days and finally transferred to 23Â°C for 4 days before the sugar treatments. Two independent, replicated experiments were performed for sucrose treatments. Each independent experiment consisted of four replicated seedlings cultures, pooled after RNA extraction.","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0},{"id":57958,"accession":"P-G3704-2","name":"P-G3704-2","text":"Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia glabra were grown for 4 days in the dark at 23Â°C in multiwell plates containing half-strenght murashige skoog medium without added sucrose.
