GSE3704GSM38614	Arabidopsis thaliana	EFO	http://purl.org/obo/owl/NCBITaxon#NCBITaxon_3702	4 days old, dark grown seedlings:  Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia glabra were grown for 4 days in the dark at 23Â°C in multiwell plates containing half-strenght murashige skoog medium without added sucrose. Sample was subsequently kept for 6h under the same conditions (aerobic)  RNA was extracted using a Ambion RNaqueous kit. Targets were produced using standard Affymetrix procedures from about 10ug of total RNA.  Each independent experiment consisted of four replicated seedlings cultures, pooled after RNA extraction. Keywords = Arabidopsis, aerobic, seedling, dark grown.

Seeds were sterilized with diluted bleach (10 min incubation in 1.7% sodium hypochlorite, rinsing and washing thoroughly in sterile water), and incubated in 2.5 ml liquid growing medium [Murashige-Skoog (MS) half strength solution] in 6-well plates. Plates were incubated in the darkness at 4Â°C for 2 days and finally transferred to 23Â°C for 4 days before the sugar treatments. Two independent, replicated experiments were performed for sucrose treatments. Each independent experiment consisted of four replicated seedlings cultures, pooled after RNA extraction. This datasets refers to one of the biological replicates.. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia glabra were grown for 4 days in the dark.
