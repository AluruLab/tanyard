Investigation Title	Transcriptome analysis of dark-grown cop1 and cop1BBX22-GFPox plants  						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome analysis of dark-grown cop1 and cop1BBX22-GFPox plants  
Experiment Description	The proper accumulation of BBX22 mediated by COP1 is crucial for plants to maintain better growth fitness when growing in the dark environment as well as responding to seasonal changes in day-length.  The constitutive-photomorphogenic development of the cop1 mutant is enhanced in cop1BBX22-GFPox plants, which show a short hypocotyl, high anthocyanin accumulation and expression of light-responsive genes.  Target genes responsible for the exaggerated light phenotype in cop1BBX22-GFPox plants were revealed by comparing transcriptomes among dark-grown wild-type, cop1 and cop1BBX22-GFPox plants.  Expression of genes regulated by light and multiple hormones are altered in plants over-accumulating BBX22, implying a coordination role of BBX22 in light- and hormone-mediated seedling development. Three biological replicates for 4-day-old etiolated seedlings of wild type (Col-0) and two mutants (cop1-4 and cop1-4BBX22-GFPox).

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = <br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16.5 hr at 45C on the GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Pine Tree Method as described in Chang et al, Plant J 54, 205 (2008) (PMID 18182030).	Seeds were surface sterilized and plated on 1/2 MS plates supplemented with 1% sucrose and grown 4 days at 21oC under the dark.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 701021 Rev. 5, Affymetrix).	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 500.
