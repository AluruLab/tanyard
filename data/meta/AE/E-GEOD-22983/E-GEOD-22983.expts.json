The constitutive-photomorphogenic development of the cop1 mutant is enhanced in cop1BBX22-GFPox plants, which show a short hypocotyl, high anthocyanin accumulation and expression of light-responsive genes.  Target genes responsible for the exaggerated light phenotype in cop1BBX22-GFPox plants were revealed by comparing transcriptomes among dark-grown wild-type, cop1 and cop1BBX22-GFPox plants.  Expression of genes regulated by light and multiple hormones are altered in plants over-accumulating BBX22, implying a coordination role of BBX22 in light- and hormone-mediated seedling development. Three biological replicates for 4-day-old etiolated seedlings of wild type (Col-0) and two mutants (cop1-4 and cop1-4BBX22-GFPox)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Shu-Hsing Wu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Chiung-Swey J Chang","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Chiung-Swey Joanne Chang","role":"submitter","email":"spike@gate.sinica.edu.tw"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21427283,"authors":"Chang CS, Maloof JN, Wu SH","title":"COP1-Mediated Degradation of BBX22\/LZF1 Optimizes Seedling Development in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1104\/pp.111.175042"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["4 days"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0","Columbia (Col-0)"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["cop1-4","cop1-4BBX22-GFPox","wild type"]},{"category":"growth condition","value":["dark"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"tissue","value":["whole seedlings"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"ECOTYPE","value":["Col-0","Columbia (Col-0)"]},{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["cop1-4","cop1-4BBX22-GFPox","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":220987,"accession":"P-GSE22983-2"},{"id":220991,"accession":"P-GSE22983-3"},{"id":220990,"accession":"P-GSE22983-1"},{"id":220985,"accession":"P-GSE22983-6"},{"id":220988,"accession":"P-GSE22983-7"},{"id":220989,"accession":"P-GSE22983-4"},{"id":220986,"accession":"P-GSE22983-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
