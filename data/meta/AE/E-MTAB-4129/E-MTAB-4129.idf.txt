Experiment Description	In order to decipher the molecular alterations caused by the growing medium, we harvested the roots of plants grown in hydroponics and on soil for 6 weeks under 10-hour short days.  The temperature was 20Â°C (day and night), the relative humidity was 70 %, and the light was provided by cool-white fluorescent tubes at 100 Î¼E.mâ2.sâ1 during the  first 10 days, 60 Î¼E.mâ2.sâ1 later. The soil was composed of a mixture of peat compost and sand (3:1 v/v), which was watered daily with tap water. Plants were transferred to 1-liter containers (six plants/container) 18 days after sowing. Plants grown in hydroponics were sown on agar-containing (6.7 g.lâ1; Kalys, France) seed-holders placed on 2-liter black containers and accessories (http://www.araponics.com). The hydroponic solution, changed every two weeks, was prepared as described in Tocquin et al. (2003). During the first three weeks of growth, the number of plants per 2-liter tank was 35 and 18 afterwards. Harvesting was performed 8 hours after the beginning of the light period (16h30), and the roots from 35 to 45 individuals were pooled. Three independent biological replicates were performed for plants grown on both media.

Protocol Description	Tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen, and RNA was extracted with TRizol according to manufacturerâs instructions (www.lifetechnologies.com).  The quality of the RNA samples was assessed using the Experion(tm) automated electrophoresis system (www.bio-rad.com).	The RNA samples were labeled using 3â IVT Expressed kit according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Affymetrix, www.affymetrix.com).	15 Âµg of fragmented cRNA was used in a 300-Âµl hybridization mixture containing added hybridization controls. 200 Âµl was hybridized on arrays for 16 h at 45Â°C. Standard post-hybridization wash and double-stain protocols (EukGE-WS2v5_450) were used on an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450. ATH1 GeneChip hybridizations, were performed by the GIGA Genomics facility (GIGA, University of LiÃ¨ge, Belgium)	Three biological replicates obtained from independent experiments were hybridized on ATH1 Genome arrays (Affymetrix).The array scanning were performed by the GIGA Genomics facility (GIGA, University of LiÃ¨ge, Belgium), using a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).	Bioinformatic analyses were performed using R programming language (R Core Team). We analysed raw microarray (â.CELâ  les) data using the limma package (Ritchie et al., 2015). Data were GCRMA-normalized, and probesets were  filtered for an absolute expression level of at least 100 in â¥ 33.3 % of the arrays. We  fitted the data to a linear model using the ebayes() function and corrected the p-value for multiple testing using Benjamini and Hochbergâs method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We considered genes as being differentially expressed when the adjusted p-value was â¤ 0.001 and fold change â¥ 2.	Root samples were collected on 6-week old plants grown in hydroponics and on soil. Harvesting was performed 8 hours after the beginning of the light period (16h30), and the roots from 35 to 45 individuals were pooled. Plants grown in soil were brushed to remove soil particles. Roots were stored at â80Â°C until used.	The temperature was 20Â°C (day and night), the relative humidity was 70 %, and the light was provided by cool-white fluorescent tubes at 100 Î¼E.mâ2.sâ1 during the  first 10 days, 60 Î¼E.mâ2.sâ1 later. The soil was composed of a mixture of peat compost and sand (3:1 v/v), which was watered daily with tap water. Plants were transferred to 1-liter containers (six plants/container) 18 days after sowing. Plants grown in hydroponics were sown on agar-containing (6.7 g.lâ1; Kalys, France) seed-holders placed on 2-liter black containers and accessories (http://www.araponics.com).  The hydroponic solution, changed every two weeks, was prepared as described in Tocquin et al. (2003). During the  first three weeks of growth, the number of plants per 2-liter tank was 35 and 18 afterwards.
