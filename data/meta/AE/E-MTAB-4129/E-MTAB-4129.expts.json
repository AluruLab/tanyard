The temperature was 20°C (day and night), the relative humidity was 70 %, and the light was provided by cool-white fluorescent tubes at 100 μE.m–2.s–1 during the  first 10 days, 60 μE.m–2.s–1 later. The soil was composed of a mixture of peat compost and sand (3:1 v\/v), which was watered daily with tap water. Plants were transferred to 1-liter containers (six plants\/container) 18 days after sowing. Plants grown in hydroponics were sown on agar-containing (6.7 g.l–1; Kalys, France) seed-holders placed on 2-liter black containers and accessories (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.araponics.com\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.araponics.com<\/a>). The hydroponic solution, changed every two weeks, was prepared as described in Tocquin et al. (2003). During the first three weeks of growth, the number of plants per 2-liter tank was 35 and 18 afterwards. Harvesting was performed 8 hours after the beginning of the light period (16h30), and the roots from 35 to 45 individuals were pooled. Three independent biological replicates were performed for plants grown on both media."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Pierre Tocquin","role":"investigator","email":"ptocquin@ulg.ac.be"},{"contact":"Claire Périlleux","role":"investigator","email":"cperilleux@ulg.ac.be"},{"contact":"Frédéric Bouché","role":"submitter","email":"bouche.fred@gmail.com"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":27352932,"authors":"Bouché F, DAloia M, Tocquin P, Lobet G, Detry N, Périlleux C.","title":"Integrating roots into a whole plant network of flowering time genes in Arabidopsis thaliana.","doi":"10.1038\/srep29042","issue":"None","pages":29042,"year":2016}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["6 week"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"growth condition","value":["hydroponic plant culture media","soil"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root structure"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["hydroponic plant culture media","soil"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1176621,"accession":"P-MTAB-47871"},{"id":1176619,"accession":"P-MTAB-47872"},{"id":1176618,"accession":"P-MTAB-47873"},{"id":1176617,"accession":"P-MTAB-47874"},{"id":1176616,"accession":"P-MTAB-47875"},{"id":1176622,"accession":"P-MTAB-47869"},{"id":1176620,"accession":"P-MTAB-47870"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":1,"isderived":0}]}]}}
