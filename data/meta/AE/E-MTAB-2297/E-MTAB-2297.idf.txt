Protocol Description	seeds were surface sterilized and sown in vitro on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.9% agar and different glucose concentrations. Seeds were then stratified for 3 days at 4degreeC and then grown in continuous light at 22degreeC. For dark development experiments, seeds were grown on MS medium containing 1% glucose, exposed to light for 8h and then grown vertically in complete darkness for 2 weeks. 	For glucose treatment experiments, seedlings were grown on MS medium containing 0.5% glucose for 7 days and transferred in MS liquid medium without glucose. After 24 hours, the medium was changed to MS medium containing 3% glucose and seedlings were collected 6 hours later. 	Total RNA was extracted and DNase treated using the RNeasy Plant mini kit (QIAGEN). 	Enzo BIoArray High Yield Transcript Labelling Kit	GeneSpring
