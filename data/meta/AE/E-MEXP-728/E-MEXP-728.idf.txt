Experiment Description	Plants were grown on soil for 35 days under short day conditions (8hrs light/16hrs dark)  at 16¡ÄC and  65% relative humidity. Flowering was induced by shifting either to long day conditions (16/8) at 16¡ÄC and 65% relative humidity or to 25¨¬C in short days (8/16). Samples were taken at day 0, 2, 5 and 9 after shifting.

Protocol Description	Plants grown at 16 C in short day conditions (8hrs light/16hrs dark) were shifted either to 16 C long days (16hrs light/8 hrs dark; Light shift) or to 25 C short days (8hrs light/16 hrs dark; Temperature shift).	Plants were grown on soil for 35 days under short day conditions (8hrs light/16hrs dark)  at 16 C and  65% relative humidity. Flowering was induced by shifting to long day conditions (16/8) at 16 C and 65% relative humidity or to 25 C in short day conditions (8/16). Samples were taken at day 0, 2, 5 and 9 after shifting. 	Apices from 25 plants per genotype/treatment were pooled and RNA was extracted.	RNA was extracted from 25 pooled shoot apices from corresponding samples using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
