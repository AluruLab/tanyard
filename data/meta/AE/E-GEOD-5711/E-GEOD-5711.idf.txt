Experiment Description	Arabidopsis sfr mutants are deficient in cold acclimation during exposure to coolnon-freezing temperatures. Although not visibly affected by the cold they have lost the ability to survive subsequent freezing. We plan to investigate how the sfr2 and sfr6 mutants respond to low temperature on the gene expression level. Wild type plants that have undergone identical treatments in parallel are necessary controls. The cold treatment of plants in the rosette stage (soil grown in a 8/16 hours day/night cycle) will be carried out in a cooled growth chamber at 4 degrees for 24 hours (same light regimetreatment starting/ending at the 4th hour of light). The aerial parts of the treated and untreated plants will be collected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. Comparison of the cold response of thousands of Arabidopsis genes in the wild type to the situation in our freezing sensitive mutants will enhance our understanding of the cold response itself and illuminate the effect of the mutations on the cold acclimation process.
