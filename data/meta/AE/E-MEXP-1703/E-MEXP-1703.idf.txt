Protocol Type	growth protocol	nucleic acid extraction protocol	treatment protocol					
Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana seeds (ecotype Columbia-0) were surface sterilized and water imbibed in the dark for 3 d at 4oC. The seeds were then inoculated in 1/2MS medium supplemented with 0.8% agar and 1% sucrose. Once the plant material was uniformly germinated, the experimental conditions were applied. 5d old light-grown uniformly germinated seedlings were washed seven times with sterile water with last wash given by 1/2MS liquid medium to remove residual exogenous sugar and the plant material was kept in 1/2MS liquid without sucrose in the dark for all subsequent steps. Cultures were shaken at 140 rpm at 22oC for 24 h and then 3h treatment was given with liquid 1/2MS without glucose and liquid 1/2MS supplemented with IAA (1?M), glucose (3%), glucose (3%) + IAA (1?M). <br>(Parameters: start time = 3, time unit = hours, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C, media = 1/2MS, 1%sucrose, 0.8% agar)	Qiagen RNAeasy kit<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Arabidopsis thaliana seeds (ecotype Columbia-0) were surface sterilized and water imbibed in the dark for 3 d at 4oC.
