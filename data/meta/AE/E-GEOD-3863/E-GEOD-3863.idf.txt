Experiment Description	Transcript profiling analysis of vfb (Vier F-Box) mutant  seedlings compared to wild type using Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip array.								
Protocol Name	P-G3863-2	P-G3863-1	P-G3863-5						
Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling						
Protocol Description	Approximately 80 mg from 5 day old light grown VFB triple mutant seedlings were collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 80 mg from 10 day old light grown Col-0 wild type seedlings were collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 6 Ã‚&#956;g of total RNA was processed to produce biotinylated cRNA targets.
