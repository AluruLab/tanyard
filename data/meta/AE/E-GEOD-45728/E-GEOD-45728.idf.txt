Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from low R:FR - SA crosstalk in Arabidopsis							
Experiment Description	Low R:FR signaling through phytochromes induces shade avoidance responses, including petiole elongation. Salicylic acid-mediated defense against pathogens is inhibited under these conditions. Using microarrays we studied the crosstalk between low R:FR and SA at the global gene expression level in Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants were exposed for 2 h. to the following treatments: high R/FR with mock spray, low R/FR with mock spray, high R/FR with SA spray, low R/FR with SA spray. Gene expression was determined in petioles.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 RMA signal	The (#900720) GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit was used for hybridization, washing, staining and scanning of the chips.	Arabidopsis thaliana plants were sown, stratified (4˚C) for 3 days and then transferred to a growth chamber (9 h. light (180 �mol / m2 / s, 20�C, 70% RH, R/FR = 2.2), 15 h dark) where they were transferred to individual pots after 10 d and gwon until 4 weeks old.	Data were processed using the Bioconductor packages in R and using the RMA normalization algorithm.	The software program Affymetrix 'GeneChip Command Console (v3.1)' was used to operate the staning, washing and scanning of the GeneChips and visual inspection of the array images. Chips were scanned using the Affymetrix 3000G scanner	Plants were put in each of the four conditions (control light with mock spray, control light with 0.5 mM SA spray, low R:FR (0.2) with mock spray, low R:FR (0.2) with 0.5 mM SA spray) for 2h. One petiole (approx. 5 mm length) per plant was harvested in liquid N2. 3 petioles/biological replicate were pooled.	Total RNA was isolated from homogenized material using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNA digestion following the company’s instructions	The Affymetrix 3'IVT-Express Labeling Kit was used to synthesize Biotin-labeled cRNA. From each RNA sample 100 ng was used as input for the labelling reactions.
