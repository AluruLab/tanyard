In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana there are 13 MBD proteins are there. To understand the gene regulation we performed microarray analysis of mutants of three genes (atmbd4, atmbd6 and atmbd11). Ten day old seedlings of these three mutant were compared  with the wild type plants grown in same condition. Surface sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were grown in MS media. Ten days old seedlings were used for isolation of RNA. The wild type plants along with T-DNA mutants of atmbd4, atmbd6 and atmbd11 were used to isolate the RNA. Three biological replicates of each sample were analyzed representing wild type, atmbd4, atmbd6 and atmbd11 of Arabidopsis."					Term Source Name	ArrayExpress	EFO				Term Source File	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/efo.owl				Person Last Name	Parida	Parida	Kapoor	Sharma		Person First Name	Adwaita	Adwaita	Sanjay	Arun		Person Mid Initials	Prasad	P		K		Person Email	adwaitaparida@gmail.com					Person Affiliation	"university of delhi, south campus"					Person Address	"plant molecular biology, university of delhi, south campus, Benito Juarez Road, delhi, Delhi, India"					Person Roles	submitter					Protocol Name	P-GSE59133-1	P-GSE59133-4	P-GSE59133-5	P-GSE59133-2	P-GSE59133-3	P-GSE59133-6Protocol Description	Data were RMA-normalized using R (v.2.11) and filterd by p_value 0.05. ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA	Biotinylated aRNA were prepared according to the revised 3' IVT Affymetrix protocol from 500ng total RNA.	"Following fragmentation, 12.5 ug of aRNA were hybridized for 16 h at 450C on ATH1 Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450."	"Seeds of each genotype were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol followed by 2 % sodium hypochloride with repeated rinses with dd-water, and were grown in MS media for ten days."	Trizol extraction of total RNA of whole seedlings was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions followed by cleanup using the Qiagen RNA mini kit.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix Gene Chip Scanner 3300.Protocol Type	normalization data transformation protocol	labelling protocol	hybridization protocol	growth protocol	nucleic acid extraction protocol	array scanning protocolExperimental Factor Name	genotype					Experimental Factor Type	genotype					Comment[SecondaryAccession]	GSE59133					Comment[GEOReleaseDate]	2014-07-09					Comment[ArrayExpressSubmissionDate]	2014-07-07					Comment[GEOLastUpdateDate]	2014-07-10					Comment[AEExperimentType]	transcription profiling by array					SDRF File	E-GEOD-59133.sdrf.txt
