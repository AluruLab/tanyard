Comment[Submitted Name]	"Expression data from dark-grown BR double mutant bzr1-1D;bri1-116, single mutant bri1-116, and wildtype"							
Experiment Description	"Molecular genetic analyses support a central role of BZR1 in Brassinosteroid (BR) regulation of plant development. The dominant bzr1-1D mutation, which stabilizes the BZR1 protein, completely suppresses the de-etiolated phenotype of the null bri1-116 mutant grown in the dark. Using microarray analysis, we identified genes differentially expressed in bri1-116 compared to wild type and genes differentially expressed in the bzr1-1D;bri1-116 double mutant compared to the bri1-116 single mutant.  Consistent with the phenotypic suppression of bri1-116 by bzr1-1D, about 80% of the genes affected in bri1-116 were affected oppositely  by bzr1-1D BZR1 regulated genes were generated from comparing genes differentially expressed by bzr1-1D;bri1-116 and bri1-116.  Genes affected by BRI1 were generated from comparing differentially expressed genes of bri1-116 and Col control. ANOVA was used to find genes whose expression was different between bzr1-1D;bri1-116 and bri1-116 or between bri1-116 and Col samples [see Supplementary file below]."

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = value	"20 μg of labeled and fragmented cRNA were hybridized with Arabidopsis ATH1 genome array, according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Affymetrix)."	"Homozygote bzr1-1D;bri1-116, segregating bri1-116, and wild type Col were grown on solid ½ MS medium with 1% sucrose in the dark for 108 hours."	"Microarray data were analyzed using Genespring software (version 7, Silicon Genetics). Data that were flagged as absent using mismatch probes were removed from the analysis.  GC_RMA signal intensities were generated.  However, note that MAS5.0 signal intensities are presented in the table below."	Arrays were scanned using Agilent GeneArray Scanner.	The seedlings were frozen in liquid nitrogen in complete darkness and then the homozygote seedlings of bri1-116 were picked individually from the heterozygous population.	"Total RNA was extracted by Plant RNA Purification Reagent (Invitrogen), treated with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen), and cleaned up using RNeasy Plant Mini column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions."	Biotinylated cRNA were preparedfrom 10ug of total RNA according to the Eukaryotic Target Protocol (Affymetrix).
