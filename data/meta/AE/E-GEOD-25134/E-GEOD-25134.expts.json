The dominant bzr1-1D mutation, which stabilizes the BZR1 protein, completely suppresses the de-etiolated phenotype of the null bri1-116 mutant grown in the dark. Using microarray analysis, we identified genes differentially expressed in bri1-116 compared to wild type and genes differentially expressed in the bzr1-1D;bri1-116 double mutant compared to the bri1-116 single mutant.  Consistent with the phenotypic suppression of bri1-116 by bzr1-1D, about 80% of the genes affected in bri1-116 were affected oppositely  by bzr1-1D BZR1 regulated genes were generated from comparing genes differentially expressed by bzr1-1D;bri1-116 and bri1-116.  Genes affected by BRI1 were generated from comparing differentially expressed genes of bri1-116 and Col control. ANOVA was used to find genes whose expression was different between bzr1-1D;bri1-116 and bri1-116 or between bri1-116 and Col samples [see Supplementary file below]."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Zhiyong Wang","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Yu Sun","role":"submitter","email":"yusun05@gmail.com"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21074725,"authors":"Sun Y, Fan XY, Cao DM, Tang W, He K, Zhu JY, He JX, Bai MY, Zhu S, Oh E, Patil S, Kim TW, Ji H, Wong WH, Rhee SY, Wang ZY.","title":"Integration of brassinosteroid signal transduction with the transcription network for plant growth regulation in Arabidopsis.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["bri1-116 null mutant","bzr1-1D;bri1-116 double mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["bri1-116 null mutant","bzr1-1D;bri1-116 double mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1127754,"accession":"P-GSE25134-3"},{"id":1127753,"accession":"P-GSE25134-4"},{"id":1127748,"accession":"P-GSE25134-1"},{"id":1127755,"accession":"P-GSE25134-2"},{"id":1127750,"accession":"P-GSE25134-7"},{"id":1127749,"accession":"P-GSE25134-8"},{"id":1127752,"accession":"P-GSE25134-5"},{"id":1127751,"accession":"P-GSE25134-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
