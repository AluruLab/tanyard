Experiment Overall Design: We firstly compared the transcriptomes in pER22-AGL24 seedlings induced by estradiol- relative to mock-treatment, which revealed the differentially expressed genes corresponding to the elevated AGL24 expression induced by estradiol. As a chemical, estradiol itself could trigger a series of elevated or repressed genes, which might represent a large portion of false positive targets of AGL24. To rule out the genes expressed exclusively in response to estradiol instead of induced AGL24 activity, we also compared the estradiol-induced transcriptomes in pER22-AGL24 relative to those in estradiol-induced wild-type seedlings because only the former contained the induced AGL24 expression. The genes showing different expression in these two comparisons only responded to induced AGL24 activity rather than estradiol- or mock-treatment.  Experiment Overall Design: Two replicates of microarray experiments were performed with biologically independent pools of samples. For pER22-AGL24 seedlings treated by estradiol- relative to mock-treatment, gene expression in mock-treated seedlings was used as the baseline, while for estradiol-treated pER22-AGL24 and wild-type seedlings, gene expression in estradiol-treated wild-type seedlings was used as the baseline."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Hao Yu","role":"submitter","email":"dbsyuhao@nus.edu.sg"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":18339670,"authors":"Chang Liu, Hongyan Chen, Hong Ling Er, Hui Meng Soo, Prakash P Kumar, Jin-Hua Han, Yih Cherng Liou, Hao Yu","title":"Direct interaction of AGL24 and SOC1 integrates flowering signals in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1242\/dev.020255","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["9 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["pER22-AGL24","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND","value":["estradiol","none"]},{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["pER22-AGL24","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":424758,"accession":"P-G6954-1"},{"id":424757,"accession":"P-G6954-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
