Experiment Description	The aim of this study was to examine the roles of Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) in flower gene expression. Flowers from arf6 arf8 plants undergo a developmental arrest at approximately stage 12, just prior to flower opening. Wild-type, ARF6/arf6 arf8/arf8, and arf6 arf8 plants were treated with 10 uM indole-3-acetic acid for thirty minutes to identify genes that respond rapidly to auxin in an ARF6/ARF8-dependent manner.    Experiment Overall Design: Wild-type, ARF6/arf6 arf8/arf8, and arf6 arf8 plants were sprayed with 10 mM indole-3-acetic acid in 1% methanol, 0.05% Tween-20. Thirty minutes after treatment, flowers (stage 1-14) were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and used for RNA extraction.
