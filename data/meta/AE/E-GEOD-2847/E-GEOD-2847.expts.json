Flowers from arf6 arf8 plants undergo a developmental arrest at approximately stage 12, just prior to flower opening. Wild-type, ARF6\/arf6 arf8\/arf8, and arf6 arf8 plants were treated with 10 uM indole-3-acetic acid for thirty minutes to identify genes that respond rapidly to auxin in an ARF6\/ARF8-dependent manner.    Experiment Overall Design: Wild-type, ARF6\/arf6 arf8\/arf8, and arf6 arf8 plants were sprayed with 10 mM indole-3-acetic acid in 1% methanol, 0.05% Tween-20. Thirty minutes after treatment, flowers (stage 1-14) were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and used for RNA extraction."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Christine Ellis","role":"submitter","email":"cellis@email.unc.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":16107481,"authors":"Punita Nagpal,Christine M Ellis,Hans Weber,Sara E Ploense,Lana S Barkawi,Thomas J Guilfoyle,Gretchen Hagen,Jose M Alonso,Jerry D Cohen,Edward E Farmer,Joseph R Ecker,Jason W Reed","title":"Auxin response factors ARF6 and ARF8 promote jasmonic acid production and flower maturation.","issue":18,"pages":"4107-18","publication":"Development","volume":132,"year":2005}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"BioSourceType","value":["frozen_sample"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["stages 1-14"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["arf6 arf8","arf6\/arf6 ARF8\/arf8","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["flower"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"Compound","value":["indole-3-acetic acid","mock","none"]},{"name":"Genotype","value":["arf6 arf8","arf6\/arf6 ARF8\/arf8","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":7,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":56461,"accession":"P-G2847-7"},{"id":56460,"accession":"P-G2847-5"},{"id":56459,"accession":"P-G2847-6"},{"id":56464,"accession":"P-G2847-3"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":56463,"accession":"P-G2847-4"},{"id":56462,"accession":"P-G2847-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":7,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":7,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":7,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":7,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
