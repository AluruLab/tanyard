Experiment Description	The Arabidopsis transcription factor WRKY27 was found to be involved in plant defense towards Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000. To identify target genes of WRKY27, we introduced a functional tagged version of WRKY27 into two independent Arabidopsis wrky27 knockout lines (ecotype Columbia) under the control of the estrogen receptor-based chemical-inducible system. 18 days old  plants grown on soil (Metro Mix 200) at 22oC under a 10/14 h light/dark cycle were treated for 6h with 10 microM beta-estradiol after which RNA was immediately isolated. The two independent knockout lines transformed with the empty vectors (pMD::XVE-SALK and pMD::XVE-ETL)  served as controls and were grown under the same conditions and treated identically as the experimental plants.
