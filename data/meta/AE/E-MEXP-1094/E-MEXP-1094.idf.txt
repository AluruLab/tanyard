Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type Col-0 and transgenic 35S::AtFAAH lines (OE2a-1, OE7a-1, and OE11a-1) were grown in growth chambers at 20 oC under short day condition (8 hrs light).  Four to five-week-old plants were used for inoculation in all experiments.	For bacterial inoculation, bacteria were grown in KB medium with appropriate antibiotics for 12 hrs and were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 rpm. Bacterial pellets were washed three times and suspended in sterile water to stated concentrations. To reduce variation in infection, vacuum infiltration was used for experiments involving microarray analysis and SA quantification. A final concentration of 0.01% of Silwet L-77 (OSI, Danbary, CT) was added to facilitate infection in spraying and vacuum infiltration experiments. After inoculation, clear plastic domes were used to cover plants to facilitate disease development.	Total RNA was isolated from 0.5 g of M. truncatula suspension cells using 5 ml of Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA) following the manufacturerÂ’s protocol. RNA was further purified by MinElute (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 		Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
