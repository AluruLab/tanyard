After 7 days, the seedling clusters were subjected to the treatments for 1 hr followed by total RNA isolation using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion). Each treatment was performed in triplicate or quadruplicate. All labeling (Enzo) and hybridization (Affymetrix) procedures were performed as directed by the manufacturers.  Raw probe intensities output by the Affymetrix MAS software were processed using the RMA algorithm to obtain an expression measure for each gene on each array."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Guixia Yu","role":"submitter","email":"gyu@berkeley.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":15466695,"authors":"Joshua I Armstrong,Shiaulou Yuan,Joseph M Dale,Vanessa N Tanner,Athanasios Theologis","title":"Identification of inhibitors of auxin transcriptional activation by means of chemical genetics in Arabidopsis.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["4-thiazolidione appended with derivatized acetic acid","control","furyl acrylate ester of thiadazole heterocycle","indole-3-acetic acid","indole-3-acetic acid and 4-thiazolidione appended with derivatized acetic acid","indole-3-acetic acid and furyl acrylate ester of thiadazole heterocycle"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":21,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":21,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":21,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":21,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":21,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
