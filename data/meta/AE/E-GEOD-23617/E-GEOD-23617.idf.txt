Investigation Title	The impact of BRCA2A and SSN2 on plant defense genes										
Comment[Submitted Name]	The impact of BRCA2A and SSN2 on plant defense genes										
Experiment Description	BRCA2A: We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes. We focused on those genes that were dramatically salicylic acid-induced (>2-fold) and BRCA2A-dependent in npr1 sni1 double mutants. SSN2: We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes. We focused on those genes that were dramatically salicylic acid-induced (P<0.05) and SSN2-dependent in npr1 sni1 double mutants. BRCA2A: 3-week old npr1 sni1 and npr1 sni1 brca2a mutants were treated with salicylic acid for 16 hours. Replicates are derived from three independent biological experiments. SSN2: 3-week old npr1 sni1 ssn2 mutants were treated with salicylic acid for 16 hours. Replicates are derived from two (SA treated) or three (water treated) independent biological experiments.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = normalized data	"Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized on Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip (Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A)."	"Arabidopsis seedlings were grown at 21-24Â°C, 16-hour day length, 60% relative humidity"	"The GSE23617_SSN2_raw_data.txt data refer to the linear data which has been summarized using a summarization algorithm (RMA16, PLIER 16 and Iterative PLIER 16). All summarization algorithms also do variance stabilization by adding 16.The normalized data are generated after the log transformation and baseline transformation step."

All summarization algorithms also do variance stabilization by adding 16. The normalized data are generated after the log transformation and baseline transformation step."	GeneChips were scanned using the Axon Genepix Scanner (Genepix 4000B).	GeneChips were scanned according to Affymetrix protocol.	3-week old npr1 sni1 brca2a mutants were treated with 0.5 mM salicylic acid for 16 hours.  Replicates are derived from two (SA treated) or three (water treated) independent biological experiments.	3-week old npr1 sni1 and npr1 sni1 brca2a mutants were treated with 0.5 mM salicylic acid for 16 hours. Replicates are derived from three independent biological experiments.	Total RNA was isolated from the frozen material using Qiagen Rneasy Plant Mini kit	RNA probes were labelled using the Ambion MessageAmp Premier.
