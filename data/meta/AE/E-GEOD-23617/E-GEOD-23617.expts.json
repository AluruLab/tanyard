We focused on those genes that were dramatically salicylic acid-induced (>2-fold) and BRCA2A-dependent in npr1 sni1 double mutants.

BRCA2A: 3-week old npr1 sni1 and npr1 sni1 brca2a mutants were treated with salicylic acid for 16 hours. Replicates are derived from three independent biological experiments.
