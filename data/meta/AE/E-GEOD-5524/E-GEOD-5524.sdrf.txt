GSE5524GSM128714	Arabidopsis thaliana	EFO	http://purl.org/obo/owl/NCBITaxon#NCBITaxon_3702	Col-0:  stratification: 2 days at 4Â°C Growth protocol: Plants were grown in Levington?s Plant Protection compost in a growth room with a 9/15 day/night cycle at 20Â°C until they reached growth stage 1.14. For Cold acclimation plants were then transferred to a growth room at 4Â°C with the same day/night cycle. Location: Growth Room Sample description: Samples were either from a cold acclimated plant or such a plant that had been frozen and allowed to recover at 20Â°C in the dark for either 3 hours or 24 hours..
