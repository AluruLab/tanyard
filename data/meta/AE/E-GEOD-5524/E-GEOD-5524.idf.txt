Experiment Description	Freezing causes physiological changes even in a hardy, cold-acclimated wild type. During recovery from freezing, gene expression will reflect the induction of damage-repair processes distinct from the damage-prevention associated with cold acclimation. This will be detected by observing the wild-type transcriptome at two time points during recovery from a freezing episode. The appropriate control is the unfrozen, cold-acclimated wild type.

Protocol Description	For cold acclimation plants were transferred to a growth room at 4Â&deg;C with a 9/15 hour day/night cycle. Material was harvested after 11 days of growth at hour 5 of the light cycle (cold acclimated control). At the end of the light cycle plants were frozen at 6.0Â&deg;C for 20 hours, then placed at 20Â&deg;C in the dark for 3 hours, at which time a sample was collected. Plants were left in the dark at 20Â&deg;C for a total of 24 hours at which time a second sample was collected.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
