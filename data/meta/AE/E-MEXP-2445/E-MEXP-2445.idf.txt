Experiment Description	To investigate the regulation mechanism of secondary cell wall synthesis during xylem vessel differentiation, we analyzed the function of two Arabidopsis MYB transcription factors, MYB46 and MYB83. Microarray analysis was performed for 11-day old seedlings of wild-type, MYB46 over-expressor, MYB83 over-expressor, and myb46 myb83 double mutant using Affymetrix ATH-1 Genome Array. Gene expressions in MYB46 over-expressor, MYB83 over-expressor, and myb46 myb83 double mutant were compared to those in wild-type.
