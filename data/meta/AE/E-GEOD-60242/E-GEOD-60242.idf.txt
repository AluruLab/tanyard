Investigation Title	Expression data from early Arabidopsis thaliana embryo						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from early Arabidopsis thaliana embryo
Experiment Description	After zygote division, the resulting daughter cells progressively give rise to two very different tissue types. With the use of microarrays, global nuclear expression profiles were generated. Tissue-specific marker lines were used to isolate nuclei from early Arabidopsis embryos by flow cytometry. Subsequently, RNA was extracted, and after amplification, hybridized to in Affymetrix ATH1 chips.

Protocol Description	The data was analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using &quot;affy&quot; package (v1.32.1). ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M) DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the ENZO BioArray™ Single-round RNA amplification and biotin labeling system.	Following fragmentation, 12.5 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on ATH1 array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Ovules including embryos from 2-16 cell stage were dissected from siliques and fixed with 0.1% PFA (paraformaldeyhde).	Long day 16 hours light/8 hours dark.	Nuclear extraction with CelLyticTM PN kit (Sigma). RNA extraction with buffer containing proteinase K.	GeneChips were scanned using Affymetrix GeneChip scanner 3000.
