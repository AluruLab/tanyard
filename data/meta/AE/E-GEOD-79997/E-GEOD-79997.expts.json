In the genome of the model tree Populus trichocarpa, 12 SnRK2 genes have been identified, and some are upregulated by abiotic stresses. In this study, we heterologously overexpressed the PtSnRK2 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and found that overexpression of PtSnRK2.5 and PtSnRK2.7 genes enhanced stress tolerance. In the PtSnRK2.5 and PtSnRK2.7 overexpressors, chlorophyll content and root elongation were maintained under salt stress conditions, leading to higher survival rates under salt stress compared with those in the wild type. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PtSnRK2.7 overexpression affected stress-related metabolic genes, including lipid metabolism and flavonoid metabolism, even under normal growth conditions. However, the stress response genes reported to be upregulated in Arabidopsis SRK2C\/SnRK2.6 and wheat SnRK2.8 overexpressors were not changed by PtSnRK2.7 overexpression. Instead, PtSnRK2.7 overexpression widely and largely influenced the transcriptome in response to salt stress; genes related to transport activity, including anion transport-related genes, were characteristically upregulated, and a variety of metabolic genes were specifically downregulated. We also found that the salt stress response genes were greatly upregulated in the PtSnRK2.7 overexpressor. Taken together, poplar subclass 2 PtSnRK2 genes can modulate salt stress tolerance in Arabidopsis, through the activation of cellular signaling pathways in a different manner from that by herbal subclass 2 SnRK2 genes. Total RNAs of the transgenic plants expressing 35S:PtSnRK2.7 treated with or without 200 mM NaCl.  As a control experiment, the wild-type plants were treated similarly. The total RNAs were used for microarray analysis to reveal genes affected by the PtSnRK2.7 overexpression."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Qiang Zhuge","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Xueqing Song","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Taku Demura","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Misato Ohtani","role":"submitter","email":"misato@bs.naist.jp"},{"contact":"Misato Ohtani","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["Nine-day old"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["35S:PtSnRK2.7:NOS, Columbia strain","wild type, Columbia strain"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["Whole seedlings"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["35S:PtSnRK2.7:NOS, Columbia strain","wild type, Columbia strain"]},{"name":"treatment","value":["Seven-day-old plants grown in the 1\/2 strength MS medium were transferred to the 1\/2 MS medium plates with 200 mM NaCl, and then cultured for additional 2 days.","Seven-day-old plants grown in the 1\/2 strength MS medium were transferred to the 1\/2 MS medium plates, and then cultured for additional 2 days."]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1214452,"accession":"P-GSE79997-7"},{"id":1214451,"accession":"P-GSE79997-1"},{"id":1214456,"accession":"P-GSE79997-2"},{"id":1214455,"accession":"P-GSE79997-3"},{"id":1214457,"accession":"P-GSE79997-4"},{"id":1214454,"accession":"P-GSE79997-5"},{"id":1214453,"accession":"P-GSE79997-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
