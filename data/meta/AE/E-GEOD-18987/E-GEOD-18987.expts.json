We reveal that Arabidopsis axillary buds located at axil of rosette leaves show dormancy and that this is broken by the decapitation of main stem, resulting in the bud outgrowth. To investigate about the molecular mechanisms of dormancy and outgrowth, we carried out gene expression analysis during axillary shoot outgrowth in Arabidopsis wild type Columbia accession. Since axillary buds did not initiate outgrowth (dormancy) at 5 day after bolting of main stem, we used 5-day bolted plants as a control (before decapitation). Then, main stems were decapitated, and axillary shoots were collected at 24 hours after decapitation (named as growing shoot). Total RNA was prepared from either control or growing shoots and used for the microarray analysis. We carried out duplicate microarray analysis using independent plant materials.Ref):Tatematsu et al., Plant Physiol. 138: 757-766 (2005).
