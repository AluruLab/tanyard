Investigation Title	Transcriptome analysis during axillary shoot outgrowth							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome analysis during axillary shoot outgrowth							
Experiment Description	In plant axillary bud dormancy and outgrowth are regulated by phytohormones, but it is still unknown about its molecular mechanism. We reveal that Arabidopsis axillary buds located at axil of rosette leaves show dormancy and that this is broken by the decapitation of main stem, resulting in the bud outgrowth. To investigate about the molecular mechanisms of dormancy and outgrowth, we carried out gene expression analysis during axillary shoot outgrowth in Arabidopsis wild type Columbia accession. Since axillary buds did not initiate outgrowth (dormancy) at 5 day after bolting of main stem, we used 5-day bolted plants as a control (before decapitation). Then, main stems were decapitated, and axillary shoots were collected at 24 hours after decapitation (named as growing shoot). Total RNA was prepared from either control or growing shoots and used for the microarray analysis. We carried out duplicate microarray analysis using independent plant materials.Ref):Tatematsu et al., Plant Physiol. 138: 757-766 (2005).  Keywords: Expression profilling by array 4 samples were used in this experiment
