Experiment Description	"Entry into the S phase of the cell cycle is controlled by the E2F transcitption factors that induce the transcription of genes required for cell cycle progression and DNA replication. To identify E2F target genes of Arabidopsis on a genome-wide scale, the transcriptome of wild-type plants was compared with that one of plants ectopically expressing the E2Fa-DPa genes. In four independent experiments, E2Fa-DPa overexpressing plants were grown side-to-side with wild type (Col-0) plants. RNA was extracted from 6-day-old seedlings. Each biological sample was harvested and processed independently, and finally all probed individually to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays, resulting into 8 hybridization signals for each probeset.
