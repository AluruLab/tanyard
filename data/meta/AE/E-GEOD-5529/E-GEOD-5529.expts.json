To identify E2F target genes of Arabidopsis on a genome-wide scale, the transcriptome of wild-type plants was compared with that one of plants ectopically expressing the E2Fa-DPa genes. In four independent experiments, E2Fa-DPa overexpressing plants were grown side-to-side with wild type (Col-0) plants. RNA was extracted from 6-day-old seedlings. Each biological sample was harvested and processed independently, and finally all probed individually to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays, resulting into 8 hybridization signals for each probeset.
