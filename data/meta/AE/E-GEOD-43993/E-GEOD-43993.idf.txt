Investigation Title	Transcript profiling of Arabidopsis epiF3 plants					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcript profiling of Arabidopsis epiF3 plants
Experiment Description	Arabidopsis msh1 mutants display developmental reprogramming (dr) phenotypes, include reduction in growth, enhanced branching, and delayed maturation and flowering time. MSH1-epi lines were derived by crossing msh1 lines with Col-0 wild type, followed by selection for homozygous MSH1/MSH1 F2 plants and serial self-pollination. MSH1-epiF3 plants displayed phenotypic variation in plant growth, showing enhanced growth, larger rosette diameter, thicker floral stems and earlier flowering time. We carried bisulfite sequencing and uncover the methylome changes accompany the heritable MSH1-epi phenotypes that condition dramatic variation in plant growth. Arabidopsis Col-0 wild type and epiF3 plant tissues were collected for RNA extration and hybridization on Affymetrix.

Protocol Description	Expression data from Affymetrix genechips were normalized using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method using Bioconductorâ€™s affy package in the R language ID_REF =  VALUE = Bioconductor RMA normalized value	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol	RNA was hybridized to individual Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide ATH1 array using manufacturers instructions	Arabidopsis Col-0 and epiF3 plants were grown in metro mix with 12hr daylight at 22°.	total RNA was extracted from each plant using TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction procedure followed by purification on RNeasy columns (Qiagen).	GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) and the GCS 3000 7G scanner for scanning, image acquisition and data processing.
