MSH1-epi lines were derived by crossing msh1 lines with Col-0 wild type, followed by selection for homozygous MSH1\/MSH1 F2 plants and serial self-pollination. MSH1-epiF3 plants displayed phenotypic variation in plant growth, showing enhanced growth, larger rosette diameter, thicker floral stems and earlier flowering time. We carried bisulfite sequencing and uncover the methylome changes accompany the heritable MSH1-epi phenotypes that condition dramatic variation in plant growth. Arabidopsis Col-0 wild type and epiF3 plant tissues were collected for RNA extration and hybridization on Affymetrix."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Sally A Mackenzie","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Ying-Zhi Xu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Ying-Zhi Xu","role":"submitter","email":"ying-zhi2@unl.edu"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["30-day-old old plant"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["aerial part"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":912435,"accession":"P-GSE43993-1"},{"id":912436,"accession":"P-GSE43993-6"},{"id":912437,"accession":"P-GSE43993-5"},{"id":912440,"accession":"P-GSE43993-3"},{"id":912438,"accession":"P-GSE43993-4"},{"id":912439,"accession":"P-GSE43993-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
