Experiment Description	Nine accessions of Arabidopsis were sampled before and after 14d of cold acclimation at 4°C. Transcript data were combined with metabolite data and related to quantitative measurement of plant freezing tolerance as determined by leaf electrolyte leakage assays.

Protocol Type	grow	specified_biomaterial_action	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	normalization	feature_extraction	
Protocol Description	Soil grown in a greenhouse with a 16 h photoperiod at a minimum of 200 &#956;mol m-2 s-1 and a day/night temperature of 20&deg;C/18&deg;C. Nonacclimated plants were harvested for all measurements at the common developmental stage of bolting (0.5-2 cm inflorescence growth). Each sample was made up of whole rosettes pooled from 10 plants.	At the same time as nonacclimated plants were harvested replicate plants were transferred to a 4&deg;C growth chamber with a 16 h photoperiod at 90 &#956;mol m-2 s-1 for an additional 14 d.
