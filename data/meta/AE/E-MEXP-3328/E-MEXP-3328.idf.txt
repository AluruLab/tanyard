Experiment Description	Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays were used to analyse changes in transcript abundance between Col-0 (wild-type) Arabidopsis seedlings and either single T-DNA insertional KO mutants of LETM1 (At3g59820)(T-DNA lines; SALK_067558C (letm1-1) and SALK_058471 (letm1-2)) or LETM2 (At1g65540) (T-DNA line; SALK_068877 (letm2-1)). Additionally, letm1 and letm2 knock out Arabidopsis lines were crossed to generate double mutants, however a double knock-out of these two genes results in an embryo lethal phenotype. Hemizygous plants were generated that were homozygous knock out for LETM1 and heterozygous knock out for LETM2, and visa versa, termed (letm1(-/-)LETM2(+/-) and (LETM1(+/-)letm2(-/-) respectively. Note that (letm1(-/-)LETM2(+/-) displays a mild developmental defective phenotype in the first 10-14 days of growth, while (LETM1(+/-)letm2(-/-) shows no phenotype. Microarray analysis was carried out on all three single homozygous knock out lines, and also on both combinations of the hemizygous mutation between the two genes, and compared with a wild-type Col-0 control to gain insight into global transcript abundance changes in these mutant lines. Arrays were performed in triplicate for each genotype, from RNA isolated from 3 independent pools of 5-10 Arabidopsis seedlings at 10 days old.

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-22400	P-MTAB-22401	
Protocol Description	Arabidopsis plants, ecotype Columbia, and T-DNA insertional lines were sown in individual pots in soil media and stratified at 4ﾺC for 48 hours before being transfered to long day growth conditions (16 hours light and 8 hours dark cycle) at a light intensity of 150 uEinsteins, 22ﾺC, 55% relative humidity and watered as needed. <br>(Parameters: start time = 16, time unit = days, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C, media = Soil mix in pots)	Leaf samples were collected, snap frozen and ground under liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit(Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions, quality was verified using a Bioanalyzer and spectrophotometric analysis was carried out to determine the A260:A280 and A260:A230 ratios to ensure both ratios were between 1.9 - 2.1<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)
