However, no reduction in vascular cell division has been reported in pxy mutants. This suggests that a compensatory mechanism promotes vascular cell division in the absence of PXY. To uncover this mechanism, the transcriptome of pxy mutants was compared to wild type counterparts."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Leo Zeef","role":"submitter","email":"leo.zeef@man.ac.uk"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23166504,"authors":"Etchells JP, Provost CM, Turner SR","title":"Plant vascular cell division is maintained by an interaction between PXY and ethylene signalling.","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.1002997","issue":11,"pages":"e1002997","publication":"PLoS Genet","volume":8,"year":2012,"uri":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pgen.1002997"},{"accession":23578929,"authors":"J.
