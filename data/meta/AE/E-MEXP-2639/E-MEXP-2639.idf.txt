Experiment Description	In gain of function studies, phloem intercalated with xylem (PXY) signalling has previously been shown to promote vascular cell division. However, no reduction in vascular cell division has been reported in pxy mutants. This suggests that a compensatory mechanism promotes vascular cell division in the absence of PXY. To uncover this mechanism, the transcriptome of pxy mutants was compared to wild type counterparts.

Protocol Description	Six inflorescence stems from the same pot were dissected out and the top half discarded. RNA was then isolated from the upper half of the remaining tissue using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). i.e. 6 samples pooled per extract.	For comparison of wild type and pxy transcriptomes, previously described Col-0 (wild type) and pxy-3 (mutation of At5g61480) lines were used (Fisher K, Turner S (2007) PXY, a receptor-like kinase essential for maintaining polarity during plant vascular-tissue development. Current Biology 17: 1061-1066). For each replicate, plants were germinated on MS agar plates prior to transfer to soil (6 plants per 10cm pot), where they were grown on for 5 weeks under long day conditions. Pots were randomised and rotated daily. For each replicate, 6 inflorescence stems from one pot were dissected out and the top half discarded. RNA was then isolated from the upper half of the remaining tissue using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen).<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C)	Six inflorescence stems from the same pot were dissected out and the top half discarded.
