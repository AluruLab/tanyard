Protocol Description	Total RNAs used for microarray analyses were prepared from the aboveground tissues of 2-week-old plants of the sGsL, Enh-ASML1, and 35S-ASML1 lines using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and subsequently purified using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) as described.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Arabidopsis seeds were kept at 4ºC for 4 days, sterilized in sterile<br><br>water, and sown on 0.3% gellan gum plates containing Murashige-Skoog medium (pH 5.8), 100 mg/L myo-inositol, 10 mg/L thiamine-HCl, 1 mg/L nicotinic acid, 1 mg/L pyridoxine-HCl, and 1% sucrose. Plates were incubated in a growth chamber at 22ºC under continuous fluorescent light at an intensity of 50 ?mol/m2/s.<br>(Parameters: start time = 2, time unit = weeks, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C)	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
