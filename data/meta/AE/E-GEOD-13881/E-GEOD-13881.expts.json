Without dexamethasone (DEX) treatment, this line is identical to the wild-type, while DEX treatment leads to strong inhibition of ARF-dependent transcription. To remove all endogenous MP-inhibiting Aux\/IAA proteins, we treated mp or GR-bdl seedlings during 1 hour with auxin (50 micromolar Indole-3-Acetic Acid), either with or without a pretreatment with 10 micromolar DEX for 1 hour. Genes that are activated by MP are expected to br downregulated in mp seedlings and in the GR-bdl line afer DEX treatment. We used biological duplicates for each of the three treatments.  Keywords: Transcriptional profiling of transcription factor targets Mp mutant and GR-bdl seeds were germinated on solid 1\/2MS media, and transferred to liquid medium after 9 days of horizontal growth. Duplicate cultures were generated for mp mutants, and quadruplicates for the GR-bdl line. 10 micromolar DEX was added to both mp cultures and to two of the GR-bdl cultures, and seedlings were gently shaken during 1 hour. Then, 50 micromolar IAA was added to all 6 cultures and seedlings were incubated with gentle shaking for another hour. Total RNA was isolated from the seedlings using a QIAgen RNeasy kit, and reverse transcription, in-vitro transcription, cRNA labling and fragemntation was done according to established methods (Schmid et al., Nature Genetics [2005] 37, 501-506). Labeled cRNA was hybridized to Arabidopsis ATH1 arrays."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Gerd Juergens","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Dolf Weijers","role":"submitter","email":"dolf.weijers@wur.nl"},{"contact":"Alexandra Schlereth","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20220754,"authors":"Schlereth A, Möller B, Liu W, Kientz M, Flipse J, Rademacher EH, Schmid M, Jürgens G, Weijers D.","title":"MONOPTEROS controls embryonic root initiation by regulating a mobile transcription factor.","doi":"10.1038\/nature08836","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["9 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["mp-B4149","pRPS5A-Myc-GR-bdl"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["mp-B4149","pRPS5A-Myc-GR-bdl"]},{"name":"TREATMENT","value":["dexamethasone and indole-3-acetic acid","indole-3-acetic acid"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":451751,"accession":"P-GSE13881-6"},{"id":451750,"accession":"P-GSE13881-5"},{"id":450848,"accession":"P-GSE13881-8"},{"id":450846,"accession":"P-GSE13881-7"},{"id":450849,"accession":"P-GSE13881-2"},{"id":450847,"accession":"P-GSE13881-1"},{"id":451753,"accession":"P-GSE13881-4"},{"id":451752,"accession":"P-GSE13881-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
