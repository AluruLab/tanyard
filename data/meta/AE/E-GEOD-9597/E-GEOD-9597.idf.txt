Experiment Description	Trichomes are found on the leaf surface of many plant species. They can be classified into either glandular or non-glandular types. Glandular trichomes are usually multicelluar structures and have long been known to participate in defense against pathogens through the production of specialized chemical products. Non-glandular trichomes, such as those in Arabidopsis thaliana, have been hypothesized to have roles in physical defense against insects, UV protection, detoxification, and heat dispersal. However, it has been difficult to separate a physical role from other possible functions for non-glandular trichomes. We have taken advantage of several mutants in the trichome developmental pathway and gene expression analyses to identify a set of genes expressed predominantly in Arabidopsis trichomes. Experiment Overall Design: We compared the gene expression between the wild type and three trichomeless mutants: gl1, ttg1 and gl3egl1 to see which genes' transcripts are enriched in trichomes.

Protocol Description	Long day condition, 16 hours light and 8 hours dark. 22 degree.	22 degree, long day condition, 16 hours light and 8 hours dark.	RNA was extracted with Qiagen RNeasy Plant RNA extraction kit.	Qiagen RNeasy Plant RNA extraction kit	Following confirmation of RNA quality, Ovationâ¢ Biotin RNA Amplification and Labeling System (NuGen Technologies, Inc., San Carlos, CA) is used to prepare amplified, biotin-labeled cDNA from total RNA for following manufacturerâs instructions. Briefly, first strand cDNA is synthesized from 25 ng of total RNA using a unique first strand DNA/RNA chimeric primer and reverse transcriptase. Following double strand cDNA generation, amplification of cDNA is achieved by utilizing an isothermal DNA amplification process that involves repeated SPIAâ¢ DNA/RNA primer binding, DNA duplication, strand displacement and RNA cleavage. The amplified SPIAâ¢ cDNA is purified and subjected to a two-step fragmentation and labeling process. The fragmented/biotinylated cDNA content is measured in a ND-1000 spectrophotometer and the quality was analyzed on an RNA 6000 Nano LabChip (Agilent) using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.
