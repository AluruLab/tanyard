Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	grow	specified_biomaterial_action	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation		
Protocol Description	Total RNA were extracted with the RNeasy PLant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA were removed using the DNAse I (RNAse free) from Ambion (Applied Biosystem) and the RNA were purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Complete removal of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA was checked by PCR on diluted RNA and RNA quality was assessed on the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) prior to reverse transcription with random primers (Superscript III, Invitrogen). <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = PCR)	Seeds were sown directly on soil and pots were placed in medium day conditions (12h light 150 uA.cm-2, 22ºC, 60% humidity, 12h dark 18ºC, 60% humidity).<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)	Leaves (ca. 80 mg) were harvested and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CHP Analysis (ExpressionStat). Description:
