The NMD core comprises seven proteins, from SMG1 to SMG7. Arabidopsis has orthologues of most of these proteins. Studies on yeast, Drosophila, Humans and Arabidopsis reveal that NMD not only functions to target PTC-containing mRNAs but also acts as a global regulator of gene expression. It has also been reported that the NMD pathway branches with some target genes being dependent on specific NMD factors. In order to determine the extent to which different NMD factors co-regulate or independently regulate Arabidopsis genes, transcriptome analysis of smg7b-1 mutants will be carried out and added to existent data of upf1, upf3 and smg5 NMD mutants for comparison. RNA will be extracted from 17 day-old mutant and wild type seedlings grown at 22-24 C under constant light. 4 samples were used in this experiment"}],"provider":[{"contact":" Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC)","role":"submitter","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"},{"contact":"Luis Arciga-Reyes","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Col-0","Col-0 (Columbia, N60000)"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["smg7 mutant","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["smg7 mutant","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":441808,"accession":"P-GSE32672-6"},{"id":441810,"accession":"P-GSE32672-4"},{"id":441809,"accession":"P-GSE32672-5"},{"id":441812,"accession":"P-GSE32672-2"},{"id":441811,"accession":"P-GSE32672-3"},{"id":441807,"accession":"P-GSE32672-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0}]}]}}
