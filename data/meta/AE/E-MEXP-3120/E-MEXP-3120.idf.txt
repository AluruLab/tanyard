Protocol Name	P-MTAB-19339	P-MTAB-19340	P-MTAB-19341		
Protocol Description	The Arabidopsis thaliana (Wassilewskija ecotype) plants were cultured in 1/2 MS medium without hormones at 22C in 16 h/8 h light/dark cycle.(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)	RNA of six plant samples was prepared from each of the following tissue types: the wild-type calli cultured on SIM for 0 day (W0), 4 days (W4), and 6 days (W6); the met1 mutant calli cultured on SIM for 0 day (T0), 4 days (T4), and 6 days (T6), Three biological replicates of each plant tissue type were carried out and evaluated. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Pistils were excised from sterile Arabidopsis plants and transferred onto callus-inducing medium (CIM, MS medium with 0.5 mg/L 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) and 1.0 mg/L 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA)). The explants were incubated for 20 days on CIM to induce callus production, and calli were then transferred onto shoot induction medium (SIM, MS medium with 0.01 mg/L indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 2 mg/L zeatin (ZT))
