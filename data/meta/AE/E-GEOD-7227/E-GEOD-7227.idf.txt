Experiment Description	"The expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix ATH1 arrays. Comparisons among the Col-0, ARF10 and mARF10 sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by ARF10. Experiment Overall Design: Germinating seeds (22 hr imbibition) from three independent biological replicates of Col-0, ARF10 and mARF10 samples, which contain three independent seed lots each, were analyzed."

Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	
Protocol Description	"Total RNA was extracted from germinating seeds (22 hr imbibition) using standard phenol-SDS extraction as described before (Sambrook et al., 1989), and then checked for RNA integrity with Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). Five Î¼g of total RNA was used to produce double-strand cDNAs which were transcribed to aRNAs (amplified RNA)."	"aRNAs were labeled with biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP in vitro according to the MessageAmpTM aRNA Amplification Kit Instruction Manual (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA)"	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
