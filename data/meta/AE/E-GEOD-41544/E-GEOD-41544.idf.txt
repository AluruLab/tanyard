Investigation Title	Arabidopsis thaliana roots at 7DAG; Col-0, scl3 (LOF) and SCL3 OE (GOF)						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Arabidopsis thaliana roots at 7DAG; Col-0, scl3 (LOF) and SCL3 OE (GOF)
Experiment Description	Transcriptional profiling of root part comparing wild type with scl3 mutant and SCL3 OE.  We used Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays to determine the effect of GRAS transcription factor SCL3 on growth and development of Arabidopsis root system by global transcriptome analysis and to identify new regulators in the regulatory pathway. Three-condition experiments, Col-0, scl3 and SCL3 OE. Biological triplicates: 3 WT, 3 scl3 and 3 SCL3 OE

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity Detection =  Detection p-value = 	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G	Following fragmentation, fragmented cDNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on Affymetrix GeneChip® Chicken Genome Array. The GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturer protocol	plant were grown on MS medium under 16 h light/ 8 h dark cycle at 22°C	Biotinylated cDNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 300 ng total RNA (GeneChip® 3â€™ IVT Express Kit User Manual P/N 702646 Rev. 1, Affymetrix).	The Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) algorithm implemented in Affymetrix Expression Console software (version1.1) was used to normalize the raw data. To reduce noise for the significance analysis, probe sets that were called Present by the MAS5 detection call in 100% of the samples were selected. Highly expressed genes that showed over 2-fold difference between the signal values of control and test samples were selected for further study.
