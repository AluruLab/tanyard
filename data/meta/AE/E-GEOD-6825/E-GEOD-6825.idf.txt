Experiment Description	At high concentrations ceasium (Cs) is toxic to plant growth. This toxic effect may occur when Cs blocks potassium (K) uptake mechanisms in plants. Consequently, plants starved of K and plants exposed to toxic concentrations of Cs should have similar gene expression patterns. To test this hypothesis, Arabidopsis will initially be grown on agar containing 1/10 MS salts before being transferred to either 1/10 MS nutrient solution (control plants), 1/10 MS nutrient solution containing 2 mM Cs, or 1/10 MS nutrient solution with no K. Roots and shoot will then be harvested seven days after transfer and used to challenge ATH1 GeneChips.
