To elucidate the biological activities of phytoprostanes in comparison to OPDA as well as the metabolism we performed genome-wide expression analysis. Experiment Overall Design: In order to get a comprehensive view of the biological activity of non-enzymatically formed reactive oxylipins the regulation of gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana was analyzed using the ATH1 chip representing 22500 genes. A mixotrophic cell culture of Arabidopsis was treated with 75 ÂµM phytoprostane A1 or with 0.5% methanol in water (Control) and harvested after 4 h. Three independent replicates of each treatment were analyzed and the fold change of normalized signals from PPA1-treated cell culture versus control cell culture was calculated."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Susanne Berger","role":"submitter","email":"berger@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":18334669,"authors":"Stefan Mueller, Beate Hilbert, Katharina Dueckershoff, Thomas Roitsch, Markus Krischke, Martin J Mueller, Susanne Berger","title":"General detoxification and stress responses are mediated by oxidized lipids through TGA transcription factors in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.107.054809","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"cell type","value":["mixotrophic"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["methanol","phytoprostane A1"]},{"name":"dose","value":["0.5 volume percent","75 micromolar"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":1124784,"accession":"P-G10719-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":1124783,"accession":"P-G10719-1"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
