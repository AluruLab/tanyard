The interest is in genes that are regulated by the circadian clock and the diurnal component (i.e. light, metabolite changes). Plants were grown on soil in a 12\/12 h light\/dark rythm at 20Â°C day and night. 5 weeks after germination the rosettes of the non-flowering plants were harvested, 15 plants per sample. Plants were harvested at 6 timepoints every 4 hours beginning with the end of the night (still in darkness)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Oliver E.
