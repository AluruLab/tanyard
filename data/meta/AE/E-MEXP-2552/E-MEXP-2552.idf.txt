Protocol Description	Total RNA was extracted from 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Seeds were sterilized and plated on 1/2 MS medium, and then stratified for 4 days before growing in a growth chamber at 23C under long-day conditions.<br>(Parameters: start time = 2, time unit = weeks, min temperature = 23, temperature unit = C, media = 1/2 MS medium)	Five micrograms of total RNA was used to generate double-stranded cDNA using a GeneChip one-cycle cDNA synthesis kit (Affymetrix) with a T7 promoter-containing oligo(dT) primer. Sythesized cDNA was in vitro transcribed and biotinylated using the GeneChip IVT labeling kit (Affymetrix).<br>(Parameters: Amount of nucleic acid labeled = 5, Amplification = none, Mass unit = Micro gram)	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 h at 45C on Affymetrix ATH1 genome arrays using and Affymetrx Fluidics Station 450.<br>(Parameters: Chamber type = OTHER: Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450, Quantity of label target used = 10, Mass unit = Micro gram, time = 16, Tiny time unit = hours, Volume unit = Nano litre, temperature = 45)	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	The data were analyzed with Micorray Suit version 5.0 (MAS5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis setting and Quantile as nomalization method.
