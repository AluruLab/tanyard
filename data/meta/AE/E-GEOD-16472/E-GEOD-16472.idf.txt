Experiment Description	The goal of this experiment was to identify the early responsive genes activated by the 22 amino acid peptide of bacterial flagellin (flg22) in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells that are involved in the initial responses important for plant innate immunity. We used the microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying intial cellular and molecular responses to microbial associated molecualr patterns (MAMPs). Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were treated with 100 nM flg22 for 30 min and 60 min.  Transcript profiles were analyzed and compared between control and treated cells to identify early flg22 responsive genes.

Protocol Description	Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerâs protocol	Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were grown in a controlled room for 28 days at 22oC, 60% relative humidity, 75 uE light and 12 hr photoperiod.	Isolated protoplasts (0.4 million) were incubated in 10 ml 0.5 M mannitol, 4 mM MES pH 5.7 and 20 mM KCl for 4 hr at 28oC before treatment with 100 nM flg22 for 30 min and 60 min.	Total RNA (1.5-4.5 Âµg) were amplified, biotinylated and fragmented using the BioArrayTM HighYieldTM RNA transcript labelling kit (Enzo) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized on the Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChips using the Affymetrix 640 Hybridization Oven. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	GeneChips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 7G with AutoLoader.	The data were analyzed in FlexArray with RMA including background correction and normalization.	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA log(2) signal intensity
