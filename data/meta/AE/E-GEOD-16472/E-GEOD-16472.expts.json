We used the microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying intial cellular and molecular responses to microbial associated molecualr patterns (MAMPs). Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were treated with 100 nM flg22 for 30 min and 60 min.  Transcript profiles were analyzed and compared between control and treated cells to identify early flg22 responsive genes."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Horim Lee","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Matthew McCormack","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jen Sheen","role":"submitter","email":"sheen@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20164835,"authors":"Boudsocq M, Willmann MR, McCormack M, Lee H, Shan L, He P, Bush J, Cheng SH, Sheen J.","title":"Differential innate immune signalling via Ca(2+) sensor protein kinases","doi":"10.1038\/nature08794","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["28 days"]},{"category":"CellType","value":["mesophyll protoplast"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND","value":["flg22","none"]},{"name":"TREATMENT TIME","value":["0 minutes","30 minutes","60 minutes"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":448897,"accession":"P-GSE16472-6"},{"id":448895,"accession":"P-GSE16472-7"},{"id":448893,"accession":"P-GSE16472-8"},{"id":448899,"accession":"P-GSE16472-2"},{"id":448896,"accession":"P-GSE16472-3"},{"id":448898,"accession":"P-GSE16472-4"},{"id":448894,"accession":"P-GSE16472-5"},{"id":448892,"accession":"P-GSE16472-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
