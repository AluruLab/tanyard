Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Signal<br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Affymetrix standard protocol	Seedlings were grown for 7 days at 22 degrees.	MAS5.0	Affymetrix Gene Array Scanner 2500A with the original setting (This means that scanning steps are conducted at a high level of sensitivity to focus on those genes that function in hormone signaling, because their transcripts are relatively less abundant. Under these conditions, signals of highly abundant transcripts may reach saturation)	Seedlings were treated with plant hormones for 30 min, 1 h, or 3 h.	guanidine-hydrochloride method	One-cycle target labeling reagents (Affymetrix)
