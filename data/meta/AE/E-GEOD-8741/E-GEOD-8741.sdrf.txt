Two transgenic lines were used: one induces the expression of a dominant, gibberellin non-responsive DELLA protein (rga-delta17); the other is a control line that carries the same vector, but lacks the rga-delta17 transgene. A time course study on the accumulation the inducible DELLA protein as well as quantitative PCR for transcripts of early gibberellin responsive genes indicated that 2h and 4h were optimal to look at DELLA-regulated genes that are also responsive to gibberellins. Strain: Transgenic line carrying a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible construct that induces the expression of a dominant form of a DELLA protein (rga-delta17) when treated with DEX.

GSE8741GSM216947	Arabidopsis thaliana	EFO	http://purl.org/obo/owl/NCBITaxon#NCBITaxon_3702	shoot	8	days	Landsberg erecta	DEX-inducible construct with reg-delta17	shoots, 4h GA4:  The aim of this study is to identify early DELLA protein-responsive genes that are also regulated by gibberellins using a DEX-inducible system. Two transgenic lines were used: one induces the expression of a dominant, gibberellin non-responsive DELLA protein (rga-delta17); the other is a control line that carries the same vector, but lacks the rga-delta17 transgene. A time course study on the accumulation the inducible DELLA protein as well as quantitative PCR for transcripts of early gibberellin responsive genes indicated that 2h and 4h were optimal to look at DELLA-regulated genes that are also responsive to gibberellins. Strain: Transgenic line carrying a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible construct that induces the expression of a dominant form of a DELLA protein (rga-delta17) when treated with DEX.
