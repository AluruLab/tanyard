Experiment Description	The aim of this study is to identify early DELLA protein-responsive genes using a Dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible system. Two transgenic lines were used: one induces the expression of a dominant, gibberellin non-responsive DELLA protein (rga-delta17); the other is a control line that carries the same vector, but lacks the rga-delta17 transgene. By comparing the gene expression changes in the line that expresses the rga-delta17 protein in the presence or absence of DEX it is possible to identify putative targets of DELLA proteins. An empty vector transgenic line was included in this study to identify genes that might be regulated by the DEX inducible system that are not dependent on the DELLA protein. Experiment Overall Design: Seedlings of both transgenic lines were pretreated for 16 h with 2 uM GA4 to enhance gibberellin responses. Because DELLA proteins are strong signaling repressors, this pretreatment should maximize the effect of DELLA induction. Eight-day old seedlings were treated with 2 uM GA4 or a combination of 2 uM GA4 plus 10 uM DEX to induce the rga-delta17 transgene. Three biological replicas for the transgenic line that carries the DEX-inducible rga-delta17 transgene were generated at 2h and 4h. For the empty vector line, only 2 biological replicas were generated at 4h of treatment with 2 uM GA with or without 10 uM DEX.

Protocol Description	Whole seedlings were sprayed with 2 uM GA4 with a fine mister, 16 h prior to the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the seedlings were resprayed with 2 uM GA4 plus 10 uM DEX and shoots were collected 2h after treatment by cutting with a razor blade.

Seeds were germinated on MS agar plates supplemented with 2% sucrose on a piece of nylon mesh as support. Seedlings were grown vertically for 8 days under continuous light at 22C. On day 7, seedlings were pretreated with 2 micromolar GA4 in maximize gibberellin responses. On day 8, seedlings were sprayed with either 2 uM GA4 (mock) or a combination of 2 uM GA and 10 uM DEX. Tissue was collected after 2h and 4h.	Qiagen RNeasy Plant minikit was used to extract RNA from 100 mg of tissue	Standard protocol from Affymetrix	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
