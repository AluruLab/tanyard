Gene Expression studies were performed using Arabidopsis wild type seedlings treated with and without salicylic acid (SA). In this study we examined pathogenesis related genes are upregulated. We used Affymetrix GeneChip to study the genome wide gene expression with and without induction of defense by treatment with SA Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis seedlings Col-0 were grown for 9 days in controlled environment rooms at 22°C temperature and a photoperiod of 16 h light 100 µm m2 s_1 cool-white fluorescent illumination. After 9 days seedlings were transferred into water as a mock treatment and with the defense related signaling molecules salicylic acid (SA) for one day. The concentration of SA (Sigma, St. Louis) was 2mM and pH 6.5. RNA extracted from SA and mock treated seedling and hybridize with Affymetrix GeneChip to examine the change in plant defence gene expression due to induction of SA."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Samir Sawant","role":"submitter","email":"deept_mbi@yahoo.co.in"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND","value":["none","salicylic acid"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":5,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":449857,"accession":"P-G14961-2"},{"id":449855,"accession":"P-G14961-1"},{"id":449856,"accession":"P-G14961-4"},{"id":449854,"accession":"P-G14961-3"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":5,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":5,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":5,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":5,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
