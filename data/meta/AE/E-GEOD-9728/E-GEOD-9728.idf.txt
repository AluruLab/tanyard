Protocol Description	Approximately 80 mg from 7 day old light grown  csn3-1 mutant seedlings were collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 80 mg from 7 day old light grown  csn5 (csn5a-2 csn5b) mutant seedlings were collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 80 mg from 7 day old dark grown  csn3-1 mutant seedlings were collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 80 mg from 7 day old dark grown  csn5 (csn5a-2 csn5b) mutant seedlings were collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 80 mg from 7 day old dark grown Col wild type seedlings were collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 80 mg from 7 day old dark grown  csn4-1 mutant seedlings were collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 80 mg from 7 day old light grown  csn4-1 mutant seedlings were collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 80 mg from 7 day old light grown CSN4-1 in Col wild type seedlings were collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 6 Â&#956;g of total RNA was processed to produce biotinylated cRNA targets.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description:
