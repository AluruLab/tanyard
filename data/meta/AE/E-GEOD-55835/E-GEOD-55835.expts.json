This is accompanied by many physiological, biochemical and molecular changes that have been extensively investigated. In addition, many cold acclimated plants become more freezing tolerant during exposure to mild, non-damaging sub-zero temperatures. There is hardly any information available about the molecular basis of this adaptation. However, Arabidopsis thaliana is among the species that acclimate to sub-zero temperatures. This makes it possible to use the molecular and genetic tools available in this species to identify components of sub-zero signal transduction and acclimation. Here, we have used microarrays and a qRT-PCR primer platform covering 1880 genes encoding transcription factors to monitor changes in gene expression in the accessions Columbia-0, Rschew and Tenela during the first three days of sub-zero acclimation at -3°C. The results indicate that gene expression during sub-zero acclimation follows a tighly controlled time-course. Especially AP2\/EREBP and WRKY transcription factors may be important regulators of sub-zero acclimation, although the CBF signal transduction pathway seems to be less important during sub-zero than during cold acclimation. Globally, we estimate that approximately 5% of all Arabidopsis genes are regulated during sub-zero acclimation. Particularly photosynthesis-related genes were down-regulated and genes belonging to the functional classes of cell wall biosynthesis, hormone metabolism and RNA regulation of transcription were up-regulated. Collectively, these data provide the first global analysis of gene expression during sub-zero acclimation and allow the identification of candidate genes for forward and reverse genetic studies into the molecular mechanisms of sub-zero acclimation. We used whole genome microarrays to monitor changes in gene expression in the Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Columbia-0, Rschew and Tenela during three days of acclimation to sub-zero temperature at -3°C after cold acclimation Plants from Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Columbia-0, Rschew and Tenela were cold acclimated at 4°C for two weeks. Detached leaves were then sub-zero acclimated at -3°C for 8 h, 1 d or 3 d at -3°C. Leaves of cold acclimated plants and sub-zero acclimated leaves were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays in order to explore temporal transcriptome changes during sub-zero acclimation. For each sample total RNA was isolated from a pool of three leaves from three different plants. The experiment was performed in three idenpendent biological replicates."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Dirk K Hincha","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Mai Q Le","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Majken Pagter","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Majken Pagter","role":"submitter","email":"pagter@mpimp-golm.mpg.de"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":25311197,"authors":"Le MQ, Pagter M, Hincha DK","title":"Global changes in gene expression, assayed by microarray hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR, during acclimation of three Arabidopsis thaliana accessions to sub-zero temperatures after cold acclimation","doi":"10.1007\/s11103-014-0256-z"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["42 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0","Rschew","Te-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"ecotype","value":["Col-0","Rschew","Te-0"]},{"name":"environmental stress","value":["cold acclimation","sub-zero acclimation"]},{"name":"time","value":["0 hour","24 hour","72 hour","8 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":34,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1169240,"accession":"P-GSE55835-6"},{"id":1169239,"accession":"P-GSE55835-7"},{"id":1169243,"accession":"P-GSE55835-2"},{"id":1169242,"accession":"P-GSE55835-3"},{"id":1169244,"accession":"P-GSE55835-4"},{"id":1169241,"accession":"P-GSE55835-5"},{"id":1169238,"accession":"P-GSE55835-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":34,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":34,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":34,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":34,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":34,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":34,"isderived":0}]}]}}
