Comment[Submitted Name]	Microarray hybridization data from the root tips of 5-day-old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown on tilted, hard agar surfaces							
Experiment Description	The growth behavior of plant roots on tilted, hard agar surfaces is determined by many basic cellular processes, including microtubule dynamics and cell wall expansion.  Among Arabidopsis thaliana accessions there is natural variation for these behaviors, including one known as skewing or slanting.  The root skewing pattern on hard, tilted agar surfaces may be a clue to adaptations of an accession to its environment. Here, we compare expression profiles of two accessions with diverse skewing behavior grown on the wave assay, which consists of seedlings growing two days vertically and 3 days tilted on hard agar plates.  Cvi has a strong skew on tilted, hard agar sufaces, and Ler-2 has a weaker one.  We also include a near isogenic line, 170G-55-16 a.k.a HGI2.1, that is mostly Ler-2 in background but has a segment of Cvi introgressed into chromosome 2.  This line has an intermediate skew between its two parents. 3 biological replicates of each of 3 genotypes (Cvi, Ler-2, and 170G-55-16/HGI2.1) were subjected to the wave assay.  After the assay, approximately 600 root tips from each biological replicate were pooled for RNA extraction and hybridization on the Affymetrix ATH1 microarray.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Quantile normalized data	For each sample, the labeled cDNA was hybridized overnight on an ATH1 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) in an AFX HybOven 480 (Affymetrix).  Post processing was done on an automated Fluidics 450 Station (Affymetrix).	Sterilized seeds of 170G-55-16, Cvi and Ler were placed on 1/2 LSPS + 1.5% agar E plates, stratified for 8 days at 4° C, and then placed in a 22° C growth chamber on a 16 h day/8 h night cycle.  Each replicate consisted of two rows of 60 seeds per row over five plates for a total of ~600 seedlings per replicate.  The plates were positioned vertically for 2 days, and then tilted back 30° for the final 3 days of growth.	Quality of microarray hybridization was determined using the Affymetrix MAS5 algorithm.  Expression differences were analyzed using ArrayStar 3 (DNAStar, Madison, WI).  The data were preprocessed using RMA and a quantile normalization method.  For statistical comparisons of expression levels, the student’s t-test option was employed with a FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg correction) multiple testing correction algorithm.	Chips were scanned with the GC 3000 G7 scanner (Affymetrix).	On the fifth day, approximately 7 mm of root tip was harvested for each seedling and pooled for each replicate.  The order of sample collection was randomized.  The root tips were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80° C until the time of RNA extraction.	RNA extraction of the ground root tissue was carried out with the RNAeasy kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer instructions.	Biotin-labeled cDNA was generated using the MessageAmp II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to manufacturer instructions.
