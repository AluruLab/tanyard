Investigation Title	Molecular responses to external pH changes in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Molecular responses to external pH changes in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana					
Experiment Description	Plants live in soils that vary considerably, both spatially and over time, in terms of nutrient composition and pH. Consistently, plants have to recognize and adapt to these changes by altering their structure and metabolism. The goal of this array analysis is to characterize the global transcriptional response to external pH changes in roots, which to date is almost unexplored. Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0) were grown in hydroponic cultures in basic nutrient solution. Two days before treatment the media was shifted to nutrient solution containing 5mM MES, pH 6. At the time of the treatment start (4 hours after light on) the plants were shifted to nutrient solutions of pH 4.5 and 6.0 (control). Root RNA samples from time point 1 and 8 hour after treatment start is used for array analyzes.  Keywords: Expression profilling by array 12 samples were used in this experiment
