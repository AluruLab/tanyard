Total RNA quantity was assessed by running 1ul of each RNA sample on a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed according to the Affymetrix Manual II, using 5ug of total RNA. Second strand cDNA synthesis was performed with minor modifications to the Affymetrix Manual II. Brieflly, cDNA termini were not blunt ended and the reaction was not terminated using EDTA. Instead Double-stranded cDNA products were immediately purified following the “Phase Lock Gel Cleanup of Double-Stranded cDNA” protocol (Affymetrix Manual II). cDNA was resuspended in 22ul of RNAse free water. cRNA preparation was performed with minor modifications to the Affymetrix Manual II.  Briefly, 11ul of cDNA was used as a template to produce biotinylated cRNA using half the recommended volumes of the ENZO BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit. Labelled cRNAs were purified following the “Qiagen RNeasy Cleanup and Quantification of Biotin-Labeled cRNA” protocol (Affymetrix Manual II). cRNA quality was assessed by on Agilent RNA6000nano LabChips (Agilent Technology 2100 Bioanalyzer Version A.01.20 SI211). cRNA quantity was assessed by running 1ul of each cRNA sample on a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies).","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0,"parameter":["Amount of nucleic acid labeled","Amplification","Label used"]}]}}
