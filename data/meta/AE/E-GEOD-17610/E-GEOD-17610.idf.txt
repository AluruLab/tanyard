Experiment Description	Transcript accumulation was measured using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array [ATH1-121501] to document changes in response to the MADS-domain transcription factor AGAMOUS-Like 15 during somatic embryogenesis. A somatic embryo system was used where mature seed is allowed to complete germination in liquid MS media containing 2,4-D and seedlings produce somatic embryos from the shoot apical meristem (SAM) region. The frequency with which these embryos are produced directly correlates with AGL15 accumulation. Experiment Overall Design: Wild type Arabidopsis (Columbia ecotype) with normal amounts of AGL15 were compared to (1) 35S:AGL15 that constitutively expresses AGL15 and produces more somatic embryos from the shoot apical region than wild type and (2) agl15 agl18 double loss-of-function mutants that produce less somatic embryos from the shoot apical region than wild type.

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis seeds (Columbia wild type, agl15-4 agl18-1 double mutant, and 35S:AGL15) were surface sterilized and grown to complete germination in liquid MS media with 2% w/v sucrose, 10 mM MES and 4.5 micromolar 2,4-D under a 23 hour light/1 hour dark cycle on a rotary shaker.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 4 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2007, Affymetrix).	The data was scaled using the Affymetrix analysis software to a target intensity of 500 and log2 transformed.	Tissue was collected 10 days after the start of culture and flash frozen for RNA isolation.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the RNA was further purified using the RNeasyÂ® plant mini kit (Qiagen, www.qiagen.com).
