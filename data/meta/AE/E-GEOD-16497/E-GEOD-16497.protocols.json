Seeds were kept in 0.1% Phytagar (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 24 h at 4°C prior to planting on Cornell mix (Landry, Chapple & Last, 1995) with Osmocoat fertilizer (Scotts). Plants were grown in Conviron growth chambers in 20x40 cm nursery flats at a photosynthetic photon flux density of 200 mmol\/m2s and a 16h photoperiod. The temperature in the chambers was 23°C and the relative humidity was 50%. Unless stated differently, plants were grown for 3 weeks and used in experiments before flowering. Aphids: All experiments were conducted with a tobacco-adapted red lineage of M. persicae. Aphids were raised on cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. Wisconsin Golden Acre; Seedway) with a 16h day (150 mmol\/m2s at 24°C) and an 8h night (19°C) at 50% relative humidity.","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1128420,"accession":"P-G16497-2","name":null,"text":"Fifty aphids were allowed to feed from 50 μL artificial diet containing sucrose and amino acids (Kim & Jander, 2007) between two layers of Parafilm (Alcan Packaging). After 24 h, artificial diet from 20 aphids and control (0 aphids) diet cups was collected and infiltrated into leaves of intact Arabidopsis plants using a 1-mL syringe without the needle. Plants for control diet and aphid saliva containing diet were grown in the same pot to allow for a paired comparison. Eighteen leaves (3 leaves from 6 plants) treated with control and aphid saliva containing diet were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.
