Similarly, infiltration of aphid saliva into Arabidopsis leaves causes only a local increase in aphid resistance. Further characterization of the defense-eliciting salivary components indicates that Arabidopsis recognizes a proteinaceous elicitor with a size between 3 to 10 kD. Genetic analysis using well-characterized Arabidopsis mutant shows that saliva-induced resistance against M. persicae is independent of the known defense signaling pathways involving salicylic acid, jasmonate, and ethylene. Among 78 Arabidopsis genes that were induced by aphid saliva infiltration, 52 had been identified previously as aphid-induced, but few are responsive to the well-known plant defense signaling molecules salicylic acid and jasmonate. Quantitative PCR analysis confirms expression of saliva-induced genes. In particular, expression of a set of O-methyltransferases, which may be involved in the synthesis of aphid-repellent glucosinolates, was significantly up-regulated by both M. persicae feeding and treatment with aphid saliva. However, this did not correlate with increased production of 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate, suggesting that aphid salivary components trigger an Arabidopsis defense response that is independent of this aphid-deterrent glucosinolate.
