Investigation Title	Epigenetic mutant gene expression analysis					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Epigenetic mutant gene expression analysis					
Experiment Description	The aim of this project is to identify endogenous targets of yet unidentified epigenetic mutants. Mutants were discovered in a forward genetic approach using T-DNA insertion mutagenesis.Pools of each 50 seedlings, grown in-vitro, will be used to examine changes in gene-expression.  Keywords: Expression profilling by array 9 samples were used in this experiment

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5 normalized signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = present, marginal, absent calls<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol	Labelled using protocol described in Affymetrix manual &quot;3' IVT Express Kit User Manual&quot;	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
