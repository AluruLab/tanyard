Experiment Description	We performed microarray experiments with RNAs from dissected immature anthers (stages 4-7) from wild-type, dyt1  and ams mutant plants, using the Affymetrix ATH1 chip. Experiment Overall Design: Anthers from Arabidopsis thaliana were selected at 4-7 stages of early development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  Samples from two mutants and wild-type anther.

Protocol Type	grow	bioassay_data_transformation	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	specified_biomaterial_action
Protocol Description	All plants were grown at 22ËšC under long day photoperiod (16 hours in light and 8 hours in darkness)	RMA to normalize and converted to logarithm base 2	RNA were extracted by using Plant RNase Mini kit (Qiagen).	Standard Affymetrix protocol.	The anthers at stages 4-7 were dissected and collected from the young floral buds of the plants of 3-4 weeks. Three biological replicates from each genetic background (Col., dyt1, and ams) were used for microarray analyses.
