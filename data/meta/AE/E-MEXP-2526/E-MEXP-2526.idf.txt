Experiment Description	Transcript profiling was performed on samples derived from plants grown under long day conditions. Time series were harvested under diurnal (L/D; light/dark cycles) at control temperature (20 C) and cold (4 C); and under circadian conditions (L/L; continuous light) at control temperature (20 C). Leaves were sampled at time 0 and after 2 h (to coincide with light-dark transitions) and then every 4 h until 58 h.

Five biological replicates at each timepoint were pooled before RNA extraction	Arabidopsis thaliana accession Columbia (Col-0) was initially grown on soil for four weeks in short days (8 h light/16 h dark) before transfer to long days (16 h light/8 h dark) at a day/night air temperature of 20 C/18 C and 150 umol m-2 s-1 light. Experiments were started when the rosette was mature (40-45 d after germination) and completed before the inflorescence reached 1 cm. <br>(Parameters: start time = 0, stop time = 6, time unit = weeks, min temperature = 18, max temperature = 20, temperature unit = C, media = soil)	RNA extraction was performed with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, http://www.qiagen.com). <br><br>aRNA was synthesized with the MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced Amplification Kit (Ambion, http://www.ambion.com) using 1 µg total RNA and 7h in vitro transcription.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = OTHER: aRNA)	aRNA was labeled with biotin using the MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced Amplification Kit (Ambion, http://www.ambion.com, starting from 1 µg total RNA and 7h in vitro transcription<br>(Parameters: Amount of nucleic acid labeled = 1, Amplification = OTHER: aRNA, Mass unit = Micro gram)	Labeled aRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 Genome arrays (ATH1) at ATLAS Biolabs (Berlin, Germany).<br>(Parameters: Chamber type = OTHER: hybridization performed at ATLAS Biolabs (Berlin, Germany), Quantity of label target used = 20, Mass unit = Micro gram, Tiny time unit = seconds, Volume unit = Nano litre, temperature = 45)	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
