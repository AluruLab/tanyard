Protocol Description	Plants were sprayed with 5uM beta-estradiol in water.	Plants were grown in growth chambers at 70% humidity and daily cycles of 16 h light and 8 h darkness at the specified temperature.	plant material of the specified number of plants was pooled per replicate	Total RNA was using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction. The quality of the isolated RNA was determined with a NanoDrop ND 1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Delaware, USA) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). Only samples with a 260 nm/280 nm ratio between 1.82.1 and a 28S/18S ratio within 1.52 were processed further.
