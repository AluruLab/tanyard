These included the WT Ler (low DOG1 expression), the near isogenic line NILDOG1-Cvi (strong DOG1 expression) and the non-dormant dog1-1 mutant (absence of DOG1 expression). NILDOG1-Cvi is the Ler WT containing an introgression of the Cvi accession on chromosome 5, which includes the DOG1 gene (Bentsink et al., 2006). The dog1-1 mutant is in the NILDOG1-Cvi genetic background. The aim was to obtain a global overview of the effect of different levels of DOG1 expression during seed maturation on the dry seed transcriptome. Gene expression in dry seeds of three genotypes was compared: Ler, NILDOG1 and the dog1-1 mutant. For each genotype, three replicates were used."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Hanzi He","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Gwendal Cueff","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Leónie Bentsink","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Bas J Dekkers","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Henk W Hilhorst","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Johannes Hanson","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Loïc Rajjou","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Leo Willems","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Leónie Bentsink","role":"submitter","email":"leonie.bentsink@wur.nl"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"dog1 expression level","value":["absent","low","strong"]},{"category":"genetic background","value":["Landsberg erecta"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["delay of germination 1 (dog1-1) mutant","DELAY Of GERMINATION 1 NIL (NILDOG1-Cvi)","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["mature freshly harvested dry seeds"]},{"category":"plant stage","value":["end of seed maturation"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"dog1 expression level","value":["absent","low","strong"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["delay of germination 1 (dog1-1) mutant","DELAY Of GERMINATION 1 NIL (NILDOG1-Cvi)","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1182950,"accession":"P-GSE65471-5"},{"id":1182949,"accession":"P-GSE65471-6"},{"id":1182948,"accession":"P-GSE65471-7"},{"id":1182947,"accession":"P-GSE65471-1"},{"id":1182952,"accession":"P-GSE65471-2"},{"id":1182951,"accession":"P-GSE65471-3"},{"id":1182953,"accession":"P-GSE65471-4"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
