Based on previous genetic analyses, we propose that plastid signaling regulates the downstream components of a light signaling network and that these interactions coordinate chloroplast biogenesis with both the light environment and development by regulating gene expression.  We tested these ideas by analyzing light-regulated and plastid-regulated transcriptomes.  We found that the plastid is a major regulator of light signaling, attenuating the expression of more than half of all light-regulated genes in our dataset and changing the nature of light regulation for a smaller fraction of these light-regulated genes. Our analyses provide evidence that light and plastid signaling are interactive processes and are consistent with these interactions serving as major drivers of chloroplast biogenesis and function. Four biological replicates were grown separately under the same conditions.  Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in the presence (+Lin) or absence (-Lin) of lincomycin in 0.5 µmol m-2 s-1 blue plus red (BR) light for 6 days. After 6 days of growth in 0.5 µmol m-2 s-1 of BR light, seedlings were transferred to 60 µmol m-2 s-1 BR light.   50-100 seedlings were collected before (0 h) and 0.5 h, 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h after the 0.5 to 60 µmol m-2 s-1 BR-fluence-rate shift for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Robert M Larkin","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Michael E Ruckle","role":"submitter","email":"rucklemi@msu.edu"},{"contact":"Lyle D Burgoon","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Michael E Ruckle","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["7 days old"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedling"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":47,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":503068,"accession":"P-GSE24517-8"},{"id":503067,"accession":"P-GSE24517-7"},{"id":503071,"accession":"P-GSE24517-6"},{"id":503073,"accession":"P-GSE24517-5"},{"id":503072,"accession":"P-GSE24517-4"},{"id":503070,"accession":"P-GSE24517-3"},{"id":503069,"accession":"P-GSE24517-2"},{"id":503066,"accession":"P-GSE24517-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":47,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":47,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":47,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":47,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":47,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":47,"isderived":0}]}]}}
