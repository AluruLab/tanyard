Investigation Title	Expression data from gbf1, gbf1 hy5, and gbf1 hyh mutants					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from gbf1, gbf1 hy5, and gbf1 hyh mutants
Experiment Description	Three bZIP transcription factors (TFs), namely GBF1, HY5, and HYH, form heterodimers with each other and regulate photomorphogenesis in an interdependent manner. GBF1 acts as both a positive and negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, whereas HY5 and HYH mainly act as positive regulators of photomorphogenesis. To study the effect of HY5 and HYH on GBF1-mediated genome-wide expression, transcript profiling was performed in the gbf1 single mutant and gbf1hy5 and gbf1hyh double mutants. Our study revealed that GBF1 mainly acts antagonistic to HY5 and HYH for genome-wide expression. Four-day-old constant white-light grown Arabidipsis seedlings of wild-type (Col-0), gbf1 mutant, gbf1 hy5 double mutant and gbf1 hyh double mutant were harvested for total RNA extraction and Affymetrix microarray hybridisation. Two biological replicates of each sample were used for hybridisation and data analysis. Data were analysed using GeneSpring software by utilising the RMA algorithm. To draw the conclusions from this study, probe level intensity of gbf1, gbf1 hy5, and gbf1 hyh was normalised against the probe level intensity of wild-type, and also the probe level intensity of gbf1 hy5 and gbf1 hyh double mutants was normalised against the probe level intensity of the gbf1 single mutant.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with GeneSpring software version 11.5.1 using RMA (Robust Multichip Averaging) with quantile normalization method. Baseline was set to median for all samples. The other parameters were left as default. Probe intensity values are represented in log scale. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 RMA-calculated signal intensity value	Biotinylated labelled aRNA were prepared from total RNA using the GeneChip 3' IVT Express kit (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	12.5 micrograms fragmented and labelled aRNA were hybridised for 16 hr at 45 degrees Celsius to Arabidopsis Affymetrix ATH1 Arrays. Arrays were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Wild-type and various mutant Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized and plated on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 0.8% Bactoagar (Difco) and 1% sucrose. The plates were then cold treated at 4 degrees Celsius for 4 days and transferred to light chambers maintained at 22 degrees Celsius with 20 micromol per meter square per second light intensities.	Total RNA was extracted from the harvested seedlings using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Quiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Stained and washed arrays were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix) controlled by GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS).
