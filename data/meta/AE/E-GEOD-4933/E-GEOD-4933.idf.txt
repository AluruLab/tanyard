Experiment Description	Red light can affect a variety of responses in Arabidopsis.  We characterize the early gene expression patterns of roots exposed to 1 hour of red light.  Early genes indicate elements involved in photomorphogenesis, chloroplast development, PAL pathways, root hair development are regulated by 1 hour of red light; We used microarrays to detail the gene expression underlying the effects of red light on roots. Experiment Overall Design: 7 Day dark-grown 1 cm Arabidopsis root tips were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We pooled samples from several Petri plates for each experiment to obtain enough RNA for arrays.  Three experiments were performed. Treatment 1 hour of red light 630 nm (max) and dark controls

Protocol Description	Seeds were sterilized with 70% ethanol 5min, two rinses  90% ethanol 10s, 4 rinses sterile water. Seeds were plated on 1/2 MS media + 1% (w/v) sucrose, 1.2% agar, pH5.6, incubated at 23 Â&deg;C in the dark for 7 days. Seedlings illuminated with 1 h of 12-14 umol m-2 s-1 red light 630 nm max wavelength.	Roots were grown in 23Â&deg;C dark for 7 days and then transferred to dark for 1 hour	Roots were grown in 23Â&deg;C dark for 7 days and then transferred to 1 hour red light	Seeds collected in RNAlater (Ambion) and roots excised for further analysis , Qiagen RNeasy kit	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared using GeneChip One-Cycle Target Labeling Kit (Affymetrix) from 5ug of total RNA.  First strand synthesis was primed with T7dT24 oligonuclided primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter seqyance on the 5'end. Second strand products were cleaned and used for IVT with biotin-labeled nucelotides.	Following fragmentation, 15 microg of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on ATH1 Arabidopsis GeneChip Array. GeneChips were washed (Molecular Probes, OR).	GeneChips were scanned using a GeneCHip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix).
