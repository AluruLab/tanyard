The enzyme-derived domains appear to be non-catalytic, but determine the function of the Arabidopsis thaliana BZR1-BAMs (BAM7 and BAM8) during transcriptional initiation. Microarray experiments with plants overexpressing different mutant versions of the proteins show that only functional BZR1-BAM variants deregulate gene expression and cause leaf developmental abnormalities. Transcriptional changes caused by overexpression of the BZR1 domain alone indicate that the BAM domain increases selectivity for the preferred cis-regulatory element BBRE (BZR1-BAM Responsive Element). In this study, we used the ATH1 GeneChip microarray to investigate transcript abundance in different Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes. Arabidopsis thaliana (accession Columbia) were grown in a nutrient-rich, medium-grade, peat-based compost in Percival AR95 growth chambers (CLF Plant Climatics) at a constant temperature of 20°C, 70% humidity and a 12-h light period with constant, uniform light intensity of 150 μmol•m-2•s-1. Three-week-old plants were harvested 4 h after onset of the light period and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fourteen individual plants were pooled per replicate."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Sebastian Soyk","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Dierk Wanke","role":"submitter","email":"dierk.wanke@zmbp.uni-tuebingen.de"},{"contact":"Klára Šimková","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Samuel C Zeeman","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Dierk Wanke","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Luise Brand","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":24748042}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["3 weeks"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["bam7","bam7 bam8","BAM7-Cat_Ox","BAM7-DNA_Ox","BAM7-Lig_Ox","BAM7-N_Ox","BAM7_Ox","bam8","BAM8-Cat_Ox","BAM8-DNA_Ox","BAM8-Lig_Ox","BAM8-N_Ox","BAM8_Ox","wildtype"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["shoot"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["bam7","bam7 bam8","BAM7-Cat_Ox","BAM7-DNA_Ox","BAM7-Lig_Ox","BAM7-N_Ox","BAM7_Ox","bam8","BAM8-Cat_Ox","BAM8-DNA_Ox","BAM8-Lig_Ox","BAM8-N_Ox","BAM8_Ox","wildtype"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":28,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1030943,"accession":"P-GSE58370-7"},{"id":1030942,"accession":"P-GSE58370-1"},{"id":1030946,"accession":"P-GSE58370-2"},{"id":1030947,"accession":"P-GSE58370-3"},{"id":1030948,"accession":"P-GSE58370-4"},{"id":1030945,"accession":"P-GSE58370-5"},{"id":1030944,"accession":"P-GSE58370-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":28,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":28,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":28,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":28,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":28,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":28,"isderived":0}]}]}}
