Experiment Description	Microarray experiments were performed using Arabidopsis wild type plants (Col-0) and srk2cf double knockout mutants to investigate functions of two osmotic stress-activated protein kinases, SRK2C and SRK2F. Transcription profiles of wild type and mutants were compared under drought stress for 0, 1 and 4 h.
