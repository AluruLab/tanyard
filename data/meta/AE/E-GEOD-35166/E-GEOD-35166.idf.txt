Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis developing inflorescence tips from er-2 mutant and epfl4, epfl6 double mutant								
Experiment Description	Inflorescence architecture of Arabidopsis thaliana is regulated by ER-EPFL4/6 signaling module. To analyze the genes governed by this module, the transcriptional profiles of er-2 (allelic to er-106) mutant and epfl4 epfl6 double mutant were investigated. 9 samples are included in this study. Three biological replicates of 33 d post germination inflorescence tips of er-2  (allelic to er-106, Lease et al., 2001) and epfl4 epfl6 were compared with wild type (Col-0) sample for changes in gene expression.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = log2 RMA signal intensity	Following fragmentation, 15 ug of cRNA was hybridized for 16 h at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Plants were grown on soil at 23C under continuous light	Data were analyzed with the limma package embedded in the Robin software using RMA normalization. P-values were corrected using Benjamini Hochberg multiple testing correction.	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).	No treatment	total RNA was extracted using the plant RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen)	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared from 100 ng total RNA with GeneChip 3' IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix).
