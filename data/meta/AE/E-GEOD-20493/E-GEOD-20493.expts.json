Glutamate synthases catalyse the last step in this pathway and two types are present in plants: NADH- or ferredoxin-dependent. Here we report a genome wide microarray analysis of the transcriptional reprogramming that occurs in leaves and roots of the A. thaliana mutant glu1-2 knocked-down in the expression of Fd-GOGAT1 (GLU1; At5g04140), one of the two genes of A. thaliana encoding ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase. Rosette leaves and roots from the glu1-2 mutant, which is a T-DNA knockout of a ferredoxin dependent glutamate synthase in Arabidopsis (locus ID: At5g04140), were analyzed on Affymetrix microarrays. As a reference control, leaves and roots from Col(0) plants were used. The glu1-2 mutant is derived from a Col(0) accession. Four independent biological replicas from leaves and roots were used in the analysis (from both glu1-2 and Col(0) reference). In total 16 hybridizations were done."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Tone Christensen","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Tommy S Jørstad","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Diem H Tran","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Atle M Bones","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Ralph Kissen","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Torfinn Sparstad","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Per Winge","role":"submitter","email":"per.winge@bio.ntnu.no"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20307264,"authors":"Kissen R, Winge P, Tran DH, Jørstad TS, Størseth TR, Christensen T, Bones AM","title":"Transcriptional profiling of an Fd-GOGAT1\/GLU1 mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana reveals a multiple stress response and extensive reprogramming of the transcriptome.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["18 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root","rosette leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["glu1-2 mutant","wild type"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["root","rosette leaf"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":16,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1132965,"accession":"P-GSE20493-1"},{"id":1132970,"accession":"P-GSE20493-2"},{"id":1132971,"accession":"P-GSE20493-3"},{"id":1132969,"accession":"P-GSE20493-4"},{"id":1132968,"accession":"P-GSE20493-5"},{"id":1132967,"accession":"P-GSE20493-6"},{"id":1132966,"accession":"P-GSE20493-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
