Experiment Description	We compared the seedling transcription profiles to determine the effects of loss-of-function of the BRX gene of Arabidopsis. BRX is required for optimal root growth. We compared seedlings of a loss-of-function line (brx) with its control background (Sav-0). Because the loss-of-function line was derived from introgression, a brx line that was complemented by a transgenic wild type copy of BRX was also included as a control. This line (rescued brx) allows the identification of expression differences that are due to introgression drag. See Mouchel et al. 2004, Genes & Dev. Vol. 18, p. 700 for a detailed description. We also compared to response of the different genotypes to the application of the phytohormones brassinolide (BL) and indole acetic acid (IAA)

Protocol Type	grow	specified_biomaterial_action	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction		
Protocol Description	Seeds were germinated in liquid MS media under constant light. 	At 4 days after germination in liquid media, seedlings were either mock-treated or treated with 1µM IAA for 1 hour  or with 5nM brassinolide for 3 hours.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy plant mini kit from Qiagen	Samples were labelled accordingly to the manufacturers instructions	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
