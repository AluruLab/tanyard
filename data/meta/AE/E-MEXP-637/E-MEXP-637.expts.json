BRX is required for optimal root growth. We compared seedlings of a loss-of-function line (brx) with its control background (Sav-0). Because the loss-of-function line was derived from introgression, a brx line that was complemented by a transgenic wild type copy of BRX was also included as a control. This line (rescued brx) allows the identification of expression differences that are due to introgression drag. See Mouchel et al. 2004, Genes & Dev. Vol. 18, p. 700 for a detailed description. We also compared to response of the different genotypes to the application of the phytohormones brassinolide (BL) and indole acetic acid (IAA)"}],"provider":[{"contact":"CÃ©line F Mouchel","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Karen S Osmont","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Christian Hardtke","role":"submitter","email":"christian.hardtke@unil.ch"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":17006513,"authors":"Mouchel CF, Osmont KS, Hardtke CS.","title":"BRX mediates feedback between brassinosteroid levels and auxin signalling in root growth","doi":"10.1038\/nature05130","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["4 day"]},{"category":"BioSourceType","value":["fresh_sample"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["1.0 Boyes key"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Sav-0"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["brx","wild type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["brassinolide","indole-3-acetic acid","none"]},{"name":"dose","value":["     ","1000 nanomolar","5 nanomolar"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["brx","wild type"]},{"name":"time","value":["     ","1 hour","3 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":88450,"accession":"P-MEXP-22034"},{"id":546013,"accession":"P-MEXP-21968"},{"id":88451,"accession":"P-MEXP-21985"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":546012,"accession":"P-MEXP-21978"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
