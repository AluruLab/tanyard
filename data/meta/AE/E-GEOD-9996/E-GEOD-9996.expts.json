In plants, perpetual (indeterminate) organ growth occurs in apical stem cell niches, which have been shown to re-establish quickly when damaged or removed (1,2). Here we ask whether the machinery of perpetual organ growth, stem cell activity, is needed for the phase of regeneration that leads to replenishing lost cell identities and patterning, or, whether organ re-establishment enlists a wider group of pluripotent cells. We adapt a root tip regeneration system to Arabidopsis that permits us to assess the molecular and functional recovery of specific cell fates during organ regeneration. These results suggest a rapid restoration of missing cell fate and function in advance of the recovery of stem cell activity. Surprisingly, plants with mutations that fail to maintain stem cell activity were able to re-pattern their distal tip and re-specify lost cell fates. Thus, although stem cell activity is required to resume indeterminate growth (3), our results show it is not necessary for cell re-specification and patterning steps. This implies a regeneration mechanism that coordinates patterning of the whole organ, as in embryogenesis, but is initiated from different starting morphologies.  1. Feldman, L. J.

We adapted root tip excision techniques to Arabidopsis, enabling us to perform microarray profiling of regenerating root tissue. Excisions were performed at 4 days post-germination (dpg) at a distance of 130 um from the root tip, resulting in the complete excision of QC, all surrounding stem cells along with several tiers of daughter cells, and the root cap, including all of the columella and most of the lateral root cap. The tip section and then approximately 70 um of regenerating tissue was recut at different time points post cutting. We sampled regenerating stumps at 0hrs, 5 hrs, 13 hrs, 22 hrs, and 7 days after the excision for microarray analysis (Methods). We also sampled root sections immediately above the zone competent to regenerate at 270 um to approximately 340 um. Experiment Overall Design: 30 samples with 4 or 3 replicates for each condition representing a time course of regenerating root stumps and including controls for root tips (regeneration endpoint) at 4 dpg and 8 dpg and a wounded set of samples representing root tissue at 270-340 mm from the root tip for non-regeneration control"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Kenneth David Birnbaum","role":"submitter","email":"ken.birnbaum@nyu.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19182776,"authors":"Sena G, Wang X, Liu HY, Hofhuis H, Birnbaum KD","title":"Organ regeneration does not require a functional stem cell niche in plants","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["4 day","8 day","unknown day"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root early differentiation region","root meristematic region","root promeristem and cap"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"age","value":["4 day","8 day","unknown day"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["root early differentiation region","root meristematic region","root promeristem and cap"]},{"name":"time","value":["0 hour","13 hour","192 hour","22 hour","5 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":30,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1137066,"accession":"P-G9996-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":1137065,"accession":"P-G9996-1"},{"id":1137064,"accession":"P-G9996-4"},{"id":1137063,"accession":"P-G9996-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":30,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":30,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":30,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":30,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
