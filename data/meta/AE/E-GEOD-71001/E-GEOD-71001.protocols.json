Data were normalized using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) expression measure in the Affy package (Gautier et al., 2004). Differentially expressed genes were identified using the LIMMA package. The obtained p-values were corrected for multiple testing errors using the BH procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) and transferred to Microsoft Excelâ„¢.
