Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis roots treated with salt from bzip1, bzip53 double knockout						
Experiment Description	Soil salinity increasingly causes crop losses worldwide. Although roots are the primary targets of salt stress, the signaling networks that facilitate metabolic reprogramming to induce stress tolerance are less understood than those in leaves. Here, a combination of transcriptomic and metabolic approaches was performed in salt-treated Arabidopsis thaliana roots, which revealed that the group S1 basic leucine zipper transcription factors bZIP1 and bZIP53 reprogram primary C- and N-metabolism. In particular, gluconeogenesis and amino acid catabolism are affected by these transcription factors. Importantly, bZIP1 expression reflects cellular stress and energy status in roots. In addition to the well-described abiotic stress response pathway initiated by the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and executed by SnRK2 (Snf1-RELATED-PROTEIN-KINASE2) and AREB-like bZIP factors, we identify a structurally related ABA-independent signaling module consisting of SnRK1s and S1 bZIPs. Crosstalk between these signaling pathways recruits particular bZIP factor combinations to establish at least four distinct gene expression patterns. Understanding this signaling network provides a framework for securing future crop productivity. RNA from roots from Control and salt treated hydroponically grown seedlings were extracted and subjected to microarray analysis

Protocol Description	Data were analysed statistically using the R language environment for statistical computing (http://www.r-project.org) version 2.9 and Bioconductor release 2.4 (Gentleman et al., 2004). Data were normalized using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) expression measure in the Affy package (Gautier et al., 2004). Differentially expressed genes were identified using the LIMMA package. The obtained p-values were corrected for multiple testing errors using the BH procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) and transferred to Microsoft Excel™. The probe set sequences were aligned to the TAIR9 gene model database of transcripts (www.arabidopsis.org).

Plants were cultured hydroponically (8/16 h day/night regime) according to (Gibeaut et al., 1997). Roots of 6-week-old plants were treated with 150 mM NaCl or equimolar concentrations of salts (KCl, MgSO4, Na2SO4) or mannitol, respectively (final osmolarity 0.25 mosM/l). To minimize the effect of circadian regulation, root material from salt-treated WT and mutant lines utilized for RT-qPCR and transcriptome studies was harvested simultaneously 1 h before the end of the light period.
