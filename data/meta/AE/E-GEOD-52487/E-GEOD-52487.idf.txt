Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis under simualted acid rain treatments
Experiment Description	Acid rain, as a worldwide environmental issue, can cause serious damage to plants. In this study, we provided the first  case study on the systematic responses of arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.) to simulated acid rain (SiAR) by transcriptome  approach. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from Arabidopsis with simulated acid rain treatments for 68 hr, and contrasting with control group in the same time. Totally, 439 differetal expression genes were obtained in our stduy. Form them, 13 genes which dramatically changed their expression were found related to S metabolism. 6 Total samples were analyzed. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Preparation of labeled target cRNA was carried out following the technical manual of Arabidopsis Genome GeneChip array (Affymetrix). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5 Î¼g of template total RNA using the One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis kit (Affymetrix), and biotin labeled cRNA was synthesized using the IVT Labeling kit (Affymetrix). The labeled cRNA was purified with GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix). The quality and quantity of the cRNA was checked by conducting gel electrophoresis. Twenty micrograms of the purified cRNA of each sample was fragmented and hybridized to arrays for 16 h at 45Â°C. All arrays were washed and stained automatically by using a fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) and scanned by GeneChipÂ® scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). All procedures were performed according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocols (Affymetrix). Normalization and expression estimate computation were calculated from the .CEL output files from the Affymetrix GCOS 1.1 software using RMA implemented in R language using standard settings. Statistical testing for differential expression was performed with logic-t analysis. Functional categories were assigned to genes using the AGI number to search the MIPS database (http://mips.gsf.de/cgi-bin/proj/thal/) and the Arabidopsis Information Resource website, TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org/).

Protocol Description	Normalization and expression estimate computation were calculated from the .CEL output files from the Affymetrix GCOS 1.1 software using RMA implemented in R language using standard settings. Statistical testing for differential expression was performed with logic-t analysis. ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA	Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5 Î¼g of template total RNA using the One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis kit (Affymetrix), and biotin labeled cRNA was synthesized using the IVT Labeling kit (Affymetrix).	Samples were hybridized using Affymetrix hybridization kit materials â€¢ Heat cocktails at 99° for 5 minutes, then 42° for 5 minutes centrifuge at max speed for 1 minute (N.B. this deviates from Affy SOP). â€¢ Transfer 200Î¼l of hyb solution to each array, then tape holes and parafilm. â€¢ Hybridize 16 hours at 45° at 60rpmâ€¢ Fluidics washing is FS450_0001	The seedlings were sprayed by simulated acid rain (AR, pH 3.0) at 5 ml per seedling, meanwhile, the seedlings were sprayed with control solution (CK, pH 5.6) which had the same ion composition as AR. The AR solution was prepared from H2SO4 and HNO3 in the ratio of 5 to 1 by chemical equivalents, which represents the average ion composition of rainfall in South China	Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) were planted in the mixed matrix with vermiculite and cover soil (2:1) after vernalization. Then, plants were grown in controlled growth chamber with a light/dark regime of 16/8 hr, temperature of 23/20°C and a light intensity of 150 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).	20 mg of total RNA from leaves of Arabidopsis with or without AR treatment was extracted using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen), and the product was used to make biotin-labeled cRNA targets.	Image processing was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System (GCOS).
