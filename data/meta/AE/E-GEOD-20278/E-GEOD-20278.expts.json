Plants were grown in LC-1 soil in 12 hour days and infected by TuMV-GFP or mock-inoculated just prior to sending up bolts.  Samples were taken from rosette leaves 10 days after inoculation.  Only tissue fluorescing GFP was selected from the virus-infected samples.  Similar tissue was sampled from mock-infected leaves.  FLAG antibody was used to isolate RPL18-HF. The RNA co-immunoprecipitated with RPL18-HF is fully translation-initiated. This translation-initiated RNA, also referred to as polysomal RNA, was isolated and compared to total RNA under both mock and TuMV-infected states to find TuMV-induced changes in host translation initiation.   ****[PLEXdb(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.plexdb.org\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.plexdb.org<\/a>) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Jackson Moeller.
