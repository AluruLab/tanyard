Investigation Title	The effect of TuMV on translation initiation in Arabidopsis							
Comment[Submitted Name]	The effect of TuMV on translation initiation in Arabidopsis							
Experiment Description	Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 expressing RPL18 fused to His & Flag epitopes (RPL18-HF) under 35S control was used to discern the effects of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) infection on host translation initiation.  Plants were grown in LC-1 soil in 12 hour days and infected by TuMV-GFP or mock-inoculated just prior to sending up bolts.  Samples were taken from rosette leaves 10 days after inoculation.  Only tissue fluorescing GFP was selected from the virus-infected samples.  Similar tissue was sampled from mock-infected leaves.  FLAG antibody was used to isolate RPL18-HF. The RNA co-immunoprecipitated with RPL18-HF is fully translation-initiated. This translation-initiated RNA, also referred to as polysomal RNA, was isolated and compared to total RNA under both mock and TuMV-infected states to find TuMV-induced changes in host translation initiation.   ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Jackson Moeller.  The equivalent experiment is AT42 at PLEXdb.] pathogen infection: TuMV inoculated - RNA fraction: polysomal RNA(3-replications);  pathogen infection: TuMV inoculated - RNA fraction: total RNA(3-replications);  pathogen infection: mock inoculated - RNA fraction: polysomal RNA(3-replications);  pathogen infection: mock inoculated - RNA fraction: total RNA(3-replications)

Protocol Description	ID_REF = Affymetrix probe set id<br>VALUE = MAS5-calculated Signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), marginal (M), or no call (NC)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 'detection p-value', p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Affy- Array Scanning	Affymetrix GeneChip Hyb	Hot Phenol/Guanidine Thiocyanate and RNeasy Clean up	Isolation of polysomal mRNA by ribosomal immunopurification	Growth Description:  Plants are grown in 12 hr days in a growth chamber, 4 plants per round pot, 10 pots per flat.  Just before the plant sends bolts, they are inoculated.	Affymetrix one-cycle target labeling	The MAS5.0 Normalization is performed using the justMAS function in the simpleaffy package of Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.org). The target value is 500 for all cases. The code was developed using R2.4.1, Bioconductor 1.9, and simpleaffy 2.8.0. The CDF files were downloaded from the Bioconductor website at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/AffymetrixChip.html. The normalization scripts are available from the PLEXdb team by request.
