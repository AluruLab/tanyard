Protocol Description	Plants were grown in 12 hour days, 90-160 uE and ~24C until 4 weeks old in soil. Plants were watered every 2-3 days and fertilized with 0.5X Hoaglands every fortnight.	Plants were exposed to 30 minutes of high light stress 1 hour after lights were turned on (dawn). High light was filtered 1300-1600 uE, at 28C and plants were well hydrated before and during the experiment. Shades were used to cover ~2/3 of the rosette such that the light intensity under the shade was 40-70 uE. Rosette leaves were collected from exposed and shaded (distal) areas.	Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Protocol (QIAGEN) including an on-column DNase treatment using the RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturerÂ’s instructions. The quality of the RNA was verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer and spectrophotometric analysis to determine concentration and the A260 to A280 and A260 to A230 ratios. 	Preparation of labelled cRNA from 1-5 ug of total RNA was carried out exactly as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, using the Affymetrix One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents.
