We were interested in seeing which subsets of BR-responsive gene transcripts were most affected and how BR-responsive gene transcripts responded to increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide both as a whole and individually. Liquid culture Arabidopsis seedlings are grown under standard conditions. Hydrogen peroxide is added at various concentrations to pre-stress the seedlings. Following this pretreatment, the seedlings are then treated with brassinosteroid (BR) hormone (epi-brassinolide, BL). Following this treatment, seedlings are harvested and total RNA is extracted for genome-wide transcriptome analysis."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Clayton T Larue","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Steven C Huber","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Steven C.
