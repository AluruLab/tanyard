Protocol Name	P-MTAB-28287	P-MTAB-28288	P-MTAB-28289	P-MTAB-28290
Protocol Description	RNA extraction described in Berrocal-lobo et al, 2002 (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Three-week-old Arabidopsis plants were spray-inoculated with a spore suspension (4 x 10^6 spores/ml) of PcBMM (0.6 ml per pot containing 5 plants). After inoculation, plants were transferred to a growth chamber with a 10 h day/14 h night photoperiod, a temperature of 24C day/22C night, and light intensity was maintained at 120–150 umol m-2 s-1. Inoculated plants were kept under high humidity in covered traits.	GenePix 4000B Microarray Scanner was performed according to the manufacturer (Parameters: Scanning hardware = GenePix 4000B [Axon Instruments], Scanning software = GenePix [Axon Instruments])	Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in phytochambers on a sterilized mixture of soil and vermiculite (3:1) with a 10 h day/14 h night photoperiod, a temperature of 22C day/20C night and 50% relative humidity . Light intensity was fixed to 120–150 umol m-2 s-1 (Hernández-Blanco et al., 2007) (Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)
