Seeds were stratified at 4ËšC for 2 days before being planted on standard media. Standard media is 1X concentration Murashige and Skoog salt mixture (Caisson laboratories), 0.5g\/L MES, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH. Nylon mesh was placed on top of the solidified media and seeds were evenly placed on the mesh in two rows. About 1cm long root tips were harvested and placed in the protoplast solution as described in Birnbaum et al. (2005) Nat. Methods. GFP expressing protoplasts  were isolated from Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter to collect total RNA.","type":"specified_biomaterial_action","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":448921,"accession":"P-G16468-3","name":"P-G16468-3","text":"Biotinylated cRNA was prepared using the two-cycle amplification protocol by Affymetrix.","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":448922,"accession":"P-G16468-4","name":"P-G16468-4","text":"RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH)","type":"nucleic_acid_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null}]}}
