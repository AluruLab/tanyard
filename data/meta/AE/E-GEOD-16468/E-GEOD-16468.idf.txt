Experiment Description	Understanding how the expression of transcription factor (TF) genes is modulated is essential for reconstructing gene regulatory networks. There is increasing evidence that sequences other than upstream noncoding can contribute to modulating gene expression, but how frequently they do so remains unclear. Here, we investigated the regulation of TFs expressed in a tissue-enriched manner in Arabidopsis roots. For 61 TFs, we created GFP reporter constructs driven by each TF's upstream noncoding sequence (including the 5'UTR) fused to the GFP reporter gene alone or together with the TF's coding sequence. We compared the visually detectable GFP patterns with endogenous mRNA expression patterns, as defined by a genome-wide microarray root expression map. Experiment Overall Design: To obtain a comprehensive non-overlapping root expression map which would be compared with promoter GFP fusion lines by imaging, we identified three cell type specific GFP marker lines and profiled transcripts in selected cell types using a cell sorting-microarray technique.

Protocol Description	Seedlings were grown vertically for 6 days at 22 degree under 16 hours of day and 8 hours of night.	Seeds were surface sterilized with 50% Bleach and 0.1% Tween for 5 minutes and then rinsed 3 times with sterile water. Seeds were stratified at 4ËC for 2 days before being planted on standard media. Standard media is 1X concentration Murashige and Skoog salt mixture (Caisson laboratories), 0.5g/L MES, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH. Nylon mesh was placed on top of the solidified media and seeds were evenly placed on the mesh in two rows. About 1cm long root tips were harvested and placed in the protoplast solution as described in Birnbaum et al. (2005) Nat. Methods. GFP expressing protoplasts  were isolated from Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter to collect total RNA.	RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH)	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared using the two-cycle amplification protocol by Affymetrix.	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
