There is increasing evidence that sequences other than upstream noncoding can contribute to modulating gene expression, but how frequently they do so remains unclear. Here, we investigated the regulation of TFs expressed in a tissue-enriched manner in Arabidopsis roots. For 61 TFs, we created GFP reporter constructs driven by each TF's upstream noncoding sequence (including the 5'UTR) fused to the GFP reporter gene alone or together with the TF's coding sequence. We compared the visually detectable GFP patterns with endogenous mRNA expression patterns, as defined by a genome-wide microarray root expression map. Experiment Overall Design: To obtain a comprehensive non-overlapping root expression map which would be compared with promoter GFP fusion lines by imaging, we identified three cell type specific GFP marker lines and profiled transcripts in selected cell types using a cell sorting-microarray technique."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Ji-Young Lee","role":"submitter","email":"jl924@cornell.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":16581911,"authors":"Ji-Young Lee, Juliette Colinas, Jean Y Wang, Daniel Mace, Uwe Ohler, Philip N Benfey","title":"Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of transcription factor expression in Arabidopsis roots.","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0510607103","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["6 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["root cortex","root phloem","root xylem"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"ORGANISM PART","value":["root cortex","root phloem","root xylem"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":8,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":448923,"accession":"P-G16468-2"},{"id":448924,"accession":"P-G16468-1"},{"id":448922,"accession":"P-G16468-4"},{"id":448921,"accession":"P-G16468-3"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
