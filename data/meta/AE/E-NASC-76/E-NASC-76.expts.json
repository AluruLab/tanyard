For each sample, approximately 30 seedlings were grown in shallow liquid MS medium for 10 days. Plants were then treated with either 200 ug\/ml OGs or, for control plants, an equal volume of water. Three replicate samples were assayed for each treatment."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Beatrice Schildknecht","role":"submitter","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"},{"contact":"Julia Dewdney","role":"investigator;submitter","email":"dewdney@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu"},{"contact":"unknown NASCArrays","role":"curator","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["10 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["flg22","oligogalacturonide","water"]},{"name":"time","value":["1 hour","3 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":90412,"accession":"NASC:LabellingProtocol"},{"id":1137603,"accession":"P-TABM-beatrice1.76"},{"id":143,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4"},{"id":90416,"accession":"NASC:ExtractProtocol:3"},{"id":90417,"accession":"P-TABM-beatrice2"},{"id":1137604,"accession":"P-TABM-beatrice3"},{"id":1137602,"accession":"P-TABM-beatrice4"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
