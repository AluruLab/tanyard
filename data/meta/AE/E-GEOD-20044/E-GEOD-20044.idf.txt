Investigation Title	High resolution NO3 response of Arabidopsis Roots							
Comment[Submitted Name]	High resolution NO3 response of Arabidopsis Roots
Experiment Description	This work uses a time series in order to decipher gene relationships and consequently to build core regulatory networks involved in Arabidopsis root adaptation to NO3- provision. The experimental approach has been to monitor genome response to NO3- at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 20 min, using ATH1 chips. This high-resolution time course analysis demonstrated that the previously known primary nitrate response is actually preceded by very fast (within 3 min) gene expression modulation, involving genes/functions needed to prepare plants to use/reduce NO3-. State-space modeling (a machine learning approach) has been used to successfully predict gene behavior in unlearnt conditions. 26 Samples: 2 at time 0 with no treatment; 4 at time 3, 2 with KCL and 2 with KNO3 treatment; 4 at time 6, 2 with KCL and 2 with KNO3 treatment; 4 at time 9, 2 with KCL and 2 with KNO3 treatment; 4 at time 12, 2 with KCL and 2 with KNO3 treatment; 4 at time 15, 2 with KCL and 2 with KNO3 treatment;  4 at time 20, 2 with KCL and 2 with KNO3 treatment;
