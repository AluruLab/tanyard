The experimental approach has been to monitor genome response to NO3- at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 20 min, using ATH1 chips. This high-resolution time course analysis demonstrated that the previously known primary nitrate response is actually preceded by very fast (within 3 min) gene expression modulation, involving genes\/functions needed to prepare plants to use\/reduce NO3-. State-space modeling (a machine learning approach) has been used to successfully predict gene behavior in unlearnt conditions. 26 Samples: 2 at time 0 with no treatment; 4 at time 3, 2 with KCL and 2 with KNO3 treatment; 4 at time 6, 2 with KCL and 2 with KNO3 treatment; 4 at time 9, 2 with KCL and 2 with KNO3 treatment; 4 at time 12, 2 with KCL and 2 with KNO3 treatment; 4 at time 15, 2 with KCL and 2 with KNO3 treatment;  4 at time 20, 2 with KCL and 2 with KNO3 treatment;"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Gabriel Krouk","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"time (minutes)","value":[0,12,15,20,3,6,9]},{"category":"tissue","value":["14 day old Roots"]},{"category":"treatment","value":["KCl","KNO3","None"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"TIME (MINUTES)","value":[0,12,15,20,3,6,9]},{"name":"TREATMENT","value":["KCl","KNO3","None"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":26,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":103223,"accession":"P-GSE20044-6"},{"id":103219,"accession":"P-GSE20044-4"},{"id":103218,"accession":"P-GSE20044-7"},{"id":103221,"accession":"P-GSE20044-5"},{"id":103220,"accession":"P-GSE20044-8"},{"id":103222,"accession":"P-GSE20044-2"},{"id":103224,"accession":"P-GSE20044-3"},{"id":103217,"accession":"P-GSE20044-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":26,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":26,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":26,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":26,"isderived":0}]}]}}
