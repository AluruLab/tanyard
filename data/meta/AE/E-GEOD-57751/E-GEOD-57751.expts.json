Previous studies on sugar signaling, using intact plants or plant tissues, were hampered by tissue heterogeneity, uneven sugar transport and\/or inter-conversions of the applied sugars.  This, in turn, could obscure the identity of a specific sugar that acts as a signal affecting expression of given gene in a given tissue or cell-type. To bypass those biases, we have developed a novel biological system, based on stem-cell-like Arabidopsis suspension culture. The cells were grown in a hormone-free medium and were sustained on xylose as the only carbon source.  The functional genomics approach was used to identify sugar responsive genes, which rapidly (within 1 h) respond specifically to low concentration (1 mM) of glucose, fructose and\/or sucrose. A habituated A. thaliana cell culture grown in a hormone free full strength MS media in the dark was adapted to growth on xylose as the only carbon source in the media.The cells were subjected to a 1 hour treatment with 1 mM of either Fru, Glc, Suc or Xyl (control). The experiments were carried out in 3 biological repeats per treatment. Whole genome expression analysis was conducted by hybridization of the extracted RNA to the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Sabine Kunz","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Edouard Pesquet","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Leszek A Kleczkowski","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Leszek Kleczkowski","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"cell culture","value":["xyl-grown cell culture"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"sugar species","value":["control (Xyl)","Fru","Glc","Suc"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"SUGAR SPECIES","value":["control (Xyl)","Fru","Glc","Suc"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1017465,"accession":"P-GSE57751-7"},{"id":1017464,"accession":"P-GSE57751-1"},{"id":1017469,"accession":"P-GSE57751-2"},{"id":1017467,"accession":"P-GSE57751-5"},{"id":1017466,"accession":"P-GSE57751-6"},{"id":1017468,"accession":"P-GSE57751-3"},{"id":1017470,"accession":"P-GSE57751-4"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
