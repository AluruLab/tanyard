Investigation Title	Sugar-dependent gene expression in xylose grown A. thaliana cell suspension culture						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Sugar-dependent gene expression in xylose grown A. thaliana cell suspension culture
Experiment Description	Sugars modulate expression of hundreds of genes in plants. Previous studies on sugar signaling, using intact plants or plant tissues, were hampered by tissue heterogeneity, uneven sugar transport and/or inter-conversions of the applied sugars.  This, in turn, could obscure the identity of a specific sugar that acts as a signal affecting expression of given gene in a given tissue or cell-type. To bypass those biases, we have developed a novel biological system, based on stem-cell-like Arabidopsis suspension culture. The cells were grown in a hormone-free medium and were sustained on xylose as the only carbon source.  The functional genomics approach was used to identify sugar responsive genes, which rapidly (within 1 h) respond specifically to low concentration (1 mM) of glucose, fructose and/or sucrose. A habituated A. thaliana cell culture grown in a hormone free full strength MS media in the dark was adapted to growth on xylose as the only carbon source in the media.The cells were subjected to a 1 hour treatment with 1 mM of either Fru, Glc, Suc or Xyl (control). The experiments were carried out in 3 biological repeats per treatment. Whole genome expression analysis was conducted by hybridization of the extracted RNA to the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array.

Protocol Description	Normalization of the raw data was achieved by using the free software Expression Console provided by Affymetrix (http://www.affymetrix.com) using the robust multi-array average (RMA) method. Subsequent analysis of the gene expression data was carried out in the freely available statistical computing language R (http://www.r-project.org) using packages available from the Bioconductor project (www.bioconductor.org). In order to search for the differentially expressed genes between X and the Y groups an empirical Bayes moderated t-test was then applied (1), using the â€˜limmaâ€™ package (2). To address the problem with multiple testing, the p-values were adjusted using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (3). 1.

ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA signal	250 ng of total RNA per sample were used to prepare biotinylated fragmented cRNA according to the GeneChip® 3â€™ IVT Express Kit Manual (PN 702646 Rev8, Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).	The hybridization of the Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array occured for 16 hours in a 45°C incubator, rotating at 60 rpm. According to the GeneChip® Expression Wash, Stain and Scan Manual (PN 702731 Rev3, Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA) the arrays were subsequently washed and stained using the Fluidics Station 450.	7 day old xyl-grown cell culture was subjected to a 1 hour treatment with 1 mM of either Fru, Glc, Suc or Xyl (control). The treatment was conducted on an orbital shaker in the dark. After removal of the treatment solution, cells were washed three times in sugar free MS-media using vacuum filtration and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.	Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension culture was grown for 7 d after sub-culturing in a hormone-free full strength MS (Murashige and Skoog) media supplied with 87 mM Xylose as the only carbon source. The culture was maintained by shaking on an orbital shaker in the dark.	The total RNA was isolated by applying TRI Reagent® (Sigma-Aldrich) and chloroform to frozen and ground plant material. Phase separation was reached by centrifugation at full speed for 15 min. The aqueous fraction was mixed with half a volume isopropanol and the nucleic acids were pelleted by a 10 min centrifugation at full speed. The pellet was washed 2 times with 70% ethanol, air-dried and subsequently taken up in sterile water. The total RNA samples were DNase-treated using RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega Biotech AB) and RNA was re-extracted as described above. RNA concentration was assessed using the ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies Inc, Palo Alto, CA).	The scanning of the Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays was done using the GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G.
