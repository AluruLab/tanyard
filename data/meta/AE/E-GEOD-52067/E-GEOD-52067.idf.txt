Protocol Name	P-GSE52067-1	P-GSE52067-5	P-GSE52067-6	P-GSE52067-2	P-GSE52067-3	P-GSE52067-4	P-GSE52067-7
Protocol Description	RMA normalized data in the Sample data tables. Further processed data were derived from GeneSpring. 20 percentile to filter for low intensity and high saturated probes. P-value cut-off 0.05. Fold change cut-off log2. ID_REF =  VALUE = Log2 RMA-signal	Biotynlated aRNA were prepared according to the standard ATH1 affymetrix protocol for 6 ug total RNA.	Hybridized for 16 hours at 45oC on GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome Array	Inflorescence tissue isolated on dry ice.	Plants were grown under standard long day growth conditions.	Total RNA was isolated from pooled inflorescence tissue (n = 3) and TRIzol (Invitrogen).	GeneChip scanned with the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.
