Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Kit (QIAGEN). 1. Grind sample under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder using Mixer Mill MM 301(Retsch). 2. Add 450 µl of Buffer RLT (1% 2-mercaptoethanol) to a maximum of 100 mg of tissue powder. Vortex vigorously. 3. Apply lysate to the QIAshredder spin column sitting in a 2-ml collection tube, and centrifuge for 2 min at maximum speed. Transfer flow-through fraction from QIAshredder to a new tube without disturbing the cell-debris pellet in the collection tube. 4. Add 0.5 volumes 100% ethanol to the cleared lysate and mix well by pipetting. 5.　Apply sample including any precipitate which may have formed,　onto an RNeasy mini spin column sitting in a 2-ml collection tube. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000 x g. 6. Pipet 700 µl Buffer RW1 onto the RNeasy column, and centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000 x g to wash. 7. Transfer RNeasy column into a new 2-ml collection tube. Pipet 500 µl Buffer RPE onto the RNeasy column, and centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000 x g. 8. Add 500 µl Buffer RPE to the RNeasy column, and centrifuge for 2 min at maximum speed to dry the RNeasy membrane. 9. Transfer RNeasy column into a new 1.5-ml collection tube, and pipet 30 of RNase-free water directly onto the RNeasy membrane.
