Protocol Name	P-MTAB-29901	P-MTAB-29902	P-MTAB-29903
Protocol Description	All Arabidopsis thaliana plants (ecotype Columbia-0 and DEWAX OX transgenic lines in the Columbia-0 background) were grown in pots on a soil mixture (3:2:1 mixture of peat moss-enriched soil:vermiculite:perlite). seeds were cold-treated for 3d at 4 C in the dark before being transferred to a controlled growth room under long-day conditions (16-/8-h light/dark cycle) at 22 to 23 C and relative 50% humidity.  (Parameters: start time = 35, time unit = days, min temperature = 23, temperature unit = C, media = soil mixture)	Total RNAs were isolated from Arabidopsis stems using a Nucleospinï¾® RNA Plant Extraction Kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, GERMONY) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. (Parameters: Extracted product = total RNA, Amplification = none)	Equal amounts of RNA from trilpicate sample were pooled
