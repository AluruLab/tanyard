Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = log2 RMA signal	Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were hybridized with 11 microgramme of labeled, amplified cRNA , washed, stained and scanned according to the protocol described in Affymetrix GeneChipÆ Expression Analysis Manual (Fluidics protocol EukGeWS2v5_450)	Seeds were plated on half MS and kept in the dark for 3 days at 4∞C. Seedlings were then transferred to white light with high R/FR ratio in 12:12 LD circles for 14 days.	Fifty seeds were plated on half MS and kept in the dark and cold for 3 days. Seedlings were grown under high R/FR conditions in 12:12 LD circles for 14 days.	Reads were mapped to the Arabidopsis thaliana genome (TAIR8, www.arabidopsis.org) using bowtie (version 0.12.7) and filtered for uniquely mapping reads. Peak were detected with the Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) algorithm (http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/). Genome Build: PH2_m1.bam: TAIR8 PH2_m1_btb_chrom.bed: TAIR8	Reads were mapped to the Arabidopsis thaliana genome (TAIR8, www.arabidopsis.org) using bowtie (version 0.12.7) and filtered for uniquely mapping reads. Peak were detected with the Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) algorithm (http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/). Genome Build: PM1_m1.bam: TAIR8 PM1_m1_btb_chrom.bed: TAIR8	Normalized expression signals were calculated from Affymetrix CEL files using RMA (Irizarry et al., 2003).	Scanning was done on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 7G	After 1h high R/FR treatment in the morning plants were transferred to low R/FR (supplemental FR) or kept in high R/FR for additional 2h.	After 2h high R/FR treatment in the morning, seedlings were transferred to low R/FR (supplemental FR) for additional 2h before protein extraction.	Seedlings were ground in cold mortar with protein extraction buffer (50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5); 100 mM NaCl; 10% glycerol; 0.1% NP-40; 1 mM DTT; 1 √ó protease inhibitors (Sigma); 50 ŒºM MG132). Soluble proteins were incubated with 40 Œºl of EZview red anti FlagM2 affinity gel (Sigma) beads for 1 h and 30 min at 4∞C. After four washes in the protein extraction buffer, specifically bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer. HRP-conjugated anti-HA antibodies (Roche) were used to detect proteins.	Seedlings were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground using a tissulyser (Qiagen) 2 times 30s, 30Hz without extraction buffer. RNAs were extracted using the Nucleo Spin for plant RNA kit (Machery-Nagel) following the manufacturer recommendations.	300ng of total RNA were amplified and labeled using the Message Amp II-biotin Enhanced reagents (Ambion; catalog #AM1791). Labeling, hybridization and scanning of the samples were performed as described by Affymetrix (www.affymetrix.com).
