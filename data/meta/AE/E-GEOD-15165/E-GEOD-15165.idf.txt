Experiment Description	We collected mature green seed compartments from 7 micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments from seeds containing mature green-stage embryos. For the purposes of this study we captured 6 compartments: embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, cellularized peripherial endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat and seed coat, as well sets of serial sections encompassing the entire mature green stage seed. Experiment Overall Design: Mature green stage seed compartments were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 14 samples (embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripherial endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat, seed coat and whole seeds, 2 biological replicates each).

Protocol Description	Plants were grown in a Conviron chamber under continuous light with fluorescent lamps at 20Â°C and 50% - 70% relative humidity.	Siliques between 1.8-2.0 cm long containing mature green-stage seeds were collected from 38-46 day old plants. Siliques were sub-divided and fixed in 3:1 (v/v) ethanol to acetic acid and embedded in paraffin. Microdissection of compartments was carried out on sections using a Leica LMD6000 system.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNaqueous Micro-Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) using a modified protocol incorporating an on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen RNase-Free DNase Set) during column washes.	5 to 6 ng of total RNA was amplified using the WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA). cDNAs were fragmented and labeled with NuGEN FL-Ovationâ¢ cDNA Biotin Module V2.
