Experiment Description	Internal sugar and light specific dependent regulation of leaf gene expression was addressed by changing [CO2] to lower than compensation point [CO2] in combination with light or prolonged darkness. Plants were grown on soil in a 12/12 h light/dark rhythm at 20Â°C day and night and under normal [CO2]. 5 weeks after germination, the above-ground rosettes of the non-flowering plants were harvested, 12 plants per sample. Plants were harvested 4hrs after the end of night (i) under low (< 50 ppm) [CO2] and 150 ÂµE fluorescent light , (ii) under normal [CO2] and light, and, (iii) under low [CO2] and prolonged darkness. The low [CO2] treatment started 30 min before the end of night and stopped with harvesting. Experiment Overall Design: 2 biological replicates of plants under 3 treatments (4hrs low CO2+light, 4hrs low CO2+prolonged darkness, and 4hrs normal CO2+light).

Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction		
Protocol Description	4 x 3 rosettes were harvested and directly frozen by liquid nitrogen, inside the growth chamber. The material of 15 rosettes was ground in liquid nitrogen.Total RNA was extracted from 250 mg fresh weight using 5 ml TriZol. Organic compounts were removed by 2 chloroform extractions. Precipitation was done with sodium chloride/sodium citrate/2-propanol over night at 4Â&deg;C. Ethanol wash of RNA pellet was done twice with 75% Ethanol. Total RNA was dissolved in pure H2O.	Approximately 10 Â&#956;g of total RNA was processed to produce biotinylated cRNA targets.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description:
