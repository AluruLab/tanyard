Plants were grown on soil in a 12\/12 h light\/dark rhythm at 20°C day and night and under normal [CO2]. 5 weeks after germination, the above-ground rosettes of the non-flowering plants were harvested, 12 plants per sample. Plants were harvested 4hrs after the end of night (i) under low (< 50 ppm) [CO2] and 150 µE fluorescent light , (ii) under normal [CO2] and light, and, (iii) under low [CO2] and prolonged darkness. The low [CO2] treatment started 30 min before the end of night and stopped with harvesting. Experiment Overall Design: 2 biological replicates of plants under 3 treatments (4hrs low CO2+light, 4hrs low CO2+prolonged darkness, and 4hrs normal CO2+light)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Oliver E.
