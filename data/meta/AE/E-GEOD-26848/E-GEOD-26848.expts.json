To examine whether the phenotypic traits of brm, ga1-3 and ga1-3\/brm lines are reflected at the gene expression level, we compared the expression profiles of brm, ga1-3, ga1-3\/brm and wild-type plants using microarray analysis.  Microarray analysis was performed on total RNA isolated from shoots of 18-d-old wt, brm, ga1-3, and ga1-3\/brm seedlings. Three biological replicates were examined for each genotype. Plants were grown simultaneously under the same conditions."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Maciej Kotlinski","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Maciej Kotli≈Ñski","role":"submitter","email":"makotlinski@gmail.com"},{"contact":"Roksana Iwanicka-Nowicka","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Marta Koblowska","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Rafal Archacki","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Andrzej Jerzmanowski","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["18 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["brm-1 mutant","ga1-3 mutant","ga1-3\/brm-1 double mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["shoot"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["brm-1 mutant","ga1-3 mutant","ga1-3\/brm-1 double mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1167977,"accession":"P-GSE26848-3"},{"id":1167978,"accession":"P-GSE26848-2"},{"id":1167972,"accession":"P-GSE26848-1"},{"id":1167973,"accession":"P-GSE26848-7"},{"id":1167974,"accession":"P-GSE26848-6"},{"id":1167975,"accession":"P-GSE26848-5"},{"id":1167976,"accession":"P-GSE26848-4"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
