Investigation Title	Expression data from VND7 induction line						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from VND7 induction line
Experiment Description	Plants typically contain two different types of cell walls: a primary wall that is being deposited around all growing cells, and a secondary wall that is produced in cells with specialized functions once they have ceased to grow. In Arabidopsis, VND7 is a transcription factor that is sufficient to activate secondary cell wall synthesis. To artificially turn on the secondary cell wall synthesis, VND7 was fused to the activation domain of the herpes virus VP16 protein and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) domain. Thus, the transgenic plants harbouring the constructs can then be treated with dexamethasone (DEX), a glucocorticoid derivative, to induce the secondary cell wall formation. We used microarrays to investigate the global program of gene expression during the secondary cell wall development and identified up- and down-regulated genes associated with this process. Cultures were harvested at indicated time points after induction (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 30, 48 h) and at time point zero (0). Uninduced cultures (DMSO instead of DEX) served as controls for each time point, and thus, 48 microarray analyses for 8 time points (3 biological reps) for +/- induced VND7-VP16-GR cultures, and 3 arrays for time 0h. To ensure that the DEX did not influence the measurements, an empty vector construct (EV), i.e., without the VND7 gene, VP16-GR, was used at three time points, i.e., VP16-GR +/- DEX at 9h, 12h, and 24h after DEX induction.

Protocol Description	The obtained ATH1 chip and expression data (CEL files) were quality control checked, and evaluated using the Robin software package. RNA levels measured by high-throughput technique RNA microarray Affymetrix ATH1 and the probe-sets were redefined according to (Dai et al., 2005). The expression levels of probe sets were then estimated by GC-robust multi-array (GCRMA) analysis using R package gcrma. ID_REF =  VALUE = Log2 GCRMA value (expression level)	RNA was labeled with biotin.	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	The cultures were induced by using a final concentration of 10 ÂµM dexamethasone (DEX) per flask and further cultivated for the time course experiment. Cultures were harvested at indicated time points after induction (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 30, 48 h) and at time point zero (0). Uninduced cultures (DMSO instead of DEX) served as controls for each time point, and thus, 48 microarray analyses for 8 time points (3 biological reps) for +/- induced VND7-VP16-GR cultures, and 3 arrays for time 0h.	Arabidopsis thaliana plant lines (Col-0) that harbor a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible pH35GVGR Gateway-based construct containing VND7-VP16-GR under the control of a 35S promoter were used. T3 seeds (~15-20 mg) were surface sterilized (10 min, 3% Na-hypochlorite) and washed five times with 1 ml of sterilized water each time. Seeds were added to 100 ml liquid MS medium supplemented with 1% sucrose (3.9 g/l Murashige & Skoog minerals including vitamins (Duchefa), adjusted with 0.45 g/l MES buffer and KOH to pH 5.7-5.8). Cultures were grown at 23Â°C for six days in the dark with 80 rpm in 250 ml flasks on a GFL 3017 shaker (GFL, Burgwedel, Germany).	Flasks were decanted over filter paper and washed 3 times with sterilized distilled H2O, dried on tissue paper, flash frozen, ball milled (Retsch 1-3 min, 30 Hz) and stored at -80Â°C until further use. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instruction.	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.
