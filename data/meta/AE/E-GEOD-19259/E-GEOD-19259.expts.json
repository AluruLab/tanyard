Typically if the ploidy is higher on the maternal side, there are fewer endosperm cells which cellularize early, and conversely, if the paternal ploidy is higher, there is more number of endosperm cells which cellularize late. Crosses involving diploid and tetraploid Arabidopsis (C24) are viable, whereas crosses involving the diploid and hexaploid, even though exhibit the above mentioned directional trend in endosperm development, abort (Scott et al 1998). The 'maternalised' and 'paternalised' development of endosperm is also observed in crosses involving some Arabidopsis mutants. Mutants in the fis class of genes, e.g. fis1-medea, when crossed with a diploid Arabidopsis (pollen parent) show endosperm development-seed development similar to a diploid (seed parent) crossed with hexaploid pollen parent. Reciprocal crosses of homozygous met1 and diploid Arabidopsis also exhibit reciprocal trends in endosperm development, where a homozygous met1 mutant (seed parent) crossed with diploid is similar in phenotype to a diploid (seed parent) - tetraploid cross. Endosperm development in the reciprocal cross has phenotypic similarity to the tetraploid (seed parent)-diploid cross (Adams et al 2000). We are interested in understanding gene profiles and trends in expression underlying the endosperm development in the interploidy crosses as well as the fis and met1 mutant. 11 samples were used in this experiment."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Sushma Tiwari","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":" Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC)","role":"submitter","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["5 days after fertilization"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["C24","Col-0","Ler-0"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["fis mutant","met1 mutant","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["siliques"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"ECOTYPE","value":["C24","Col-0","Ler-0"]},{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["fis mutant","met1 mutant","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":11,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":446845,"accession":"P-GSE19259-1"},{"id":446847,"accession":"P-GSE19259-6"},{"id":446848,"accession":"P-GSE19259-4"},{"id":446846,"accession":"P-GSE19259-5"},{"id":446849,"accession":"P-GSE19259-2"},{"id":446850,"accession":"P-GSE19259-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":11,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":11,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":11,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":11,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":11,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":11,"isderived":0}]}]}}
