A number of genes related to amino acid, protein metabolism, growth, regulatory networks, respiratory pathways, stress, defense and secondary metabolism were altered. Experiment Overall Design: Surfactant (preference 0.25%) treated plants were used as carrier control group and EC50 concentration of triazolopyrimidine was used as the herbicide treatment group. Each of the control and treatment group consisted of 3 biological replicates and each biological replicates comprised leaves from 10 individual plants. RNA was extracted at 24h post treatment to study the transcriptional alterations caused by the herbicide treatment."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Malay Das","role":"submitter","email":"das.malay@epa.gov"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20043233,"authors":"Das M, Reichman JR, Haberer G, Welzl G, Aceituno FF, Mader MT, Watrud LS, Pfleeger TG, Gutiérrez RA, Schäffner AR, Olszyk DM","title":"A composite transcriptional signature differentiates responses towards closely related herbicides in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["control","triazolopyrimidine"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1125580,"accession":"P-G8926-5"},{"id":1125579,"accession":"P-G8926-3"},{"id":1125578,"accession":"P-G8926-4"},{"id":1125582,"accession":"P-G8926-1"},{"id":1125581,"accession":"P-G8926-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
