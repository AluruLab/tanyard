The overexpression line 6-9 of AtGATA2 suppresses the etiolated phenotype of Col-0 grown in the dark. Using microarray analysis, we identified genes differentially expressed in the AtGATA2ox transgenic line 6-9 compared to wild type, and genes differentially expressed in the AtGATA2ox transgenic line 6-9 compared to the bri1-116 single mutant.  Consistent with the phenotypic similarity of bri1-116 and AtGATA2, overall about 93% of the co-regulated genes were affected in the same way by GATA2-ox and bri1-116. AtGATA2-regulated genes have been identified by comparing genes differentially expressed by the Col control and bri1-116, which could find the crosslink between light and BR regulations of plant development."}],"provider":[{"contact":"wenhui lin","role":"submitter","email":"whlin@ibcas.ac.cn"},{"contact":"Zhiyong Wang","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21145502,"authors":"Luo XM, Lin WH, Zhu S, Zhu JY, Sun Y, Fan XY, Cheng M, Hao Y, Oh E, Tian M, Liu L, Zhang M, Xie Q, Chong K, Wang ZY.","title":"Integration of light- and brassinosteroid-signaling pathways by a GATA transcription factor in Arabidopsis.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["AtGATA2 overexpression","bri1-116 null mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"germplasm","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["AtGATA2ox transgenic","bri1-116 null mutant","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1127728,"accession":"P-GSE25396-6"},{"id":1127729,"accession":"P-GSE25396-5"},{"id":1127732,"accession":"P-GSE25396-4"},{"id":1127730,"accession":"P-GSE25396-3"},{"id":1127725,"accession":"P-GSE25396-9"},{"id":1127727,"accession":"P-GSE25396-8"},{"id":1127726,"accession":"P-GSE25396-7"},{"id":1127731,"accession":"P-GSE25396-2"},{"id":1127724,"accession":"P-GSE25396-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
