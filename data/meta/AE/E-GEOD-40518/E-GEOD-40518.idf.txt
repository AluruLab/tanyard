Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis trichome from 5th and 6th rosette leaves of gtl1-1 mutant and wild type controls						
Investigation Title	Comparison of gene expression in Arabidopsis 5th and 6th rosette leaves  between gtl1-1 mutant and wild type						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Comparison of gene expression in Arabidopsis trichome between gtl1-1 mutant and wild type						
Experiment Description	"Total RNA from trichomes of fifth and sixth rosette leaves of three-week-old wild-type and gtl1-1 mutants (Figure 3B) were extracted. We found a total number of 1,759 genes, corresponding to 1,694 probes on the ATH1 chip, that show differential expression of at least 1.3-fold. Out of these 1,694 genes, 47.2% are positively regulated and 52.8% are negatively regulated by GTL1. Compared gene expressions in fifth and sixth rosette leaves of three-week-old wild-type and gtl1-1 mutants"

Protocol Name	P-GSE40518-1	P-GSE40518-5	P-GSE40518-6	P-GSE40518-2	P-GSE40518-3	P-GSE40518-4	P-GSE40518-7
Protocol Description	"Affy-GUI, normalized by GCRMA. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 GCRMA"	"RNA probes were labeled using an Affymetrix 3' IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Japan)"	"Hybridized onto Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome GeneChips(r) (Affymetrix Inc., USA) according to manifucture's instruction (Affymetrix)."	N/A	"Plants were germinated and grown on plates containing Murashige and Skoog salts, pH 5.7, 1% sucrose (w/v), and 0.5% phytogel (w/v) in continuous light at 22 degrees C."	"Trichomes were removed with forceps from the fifth and sixth rosette leaves of three-week-old wild-type and gtl1-1 mutant plants according to a previously established protocol (Jakoby et al, 2008). Total RNA was extracted from three biological replicates by a Qiagen plant RNeasy kit, and treated with DNaseI (Takara Bio, Japan) following the manufacturer's instructions."	"GeneChips are scanned in a GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix Inc., USA) and CEL files are generated from DAT files using GeneChip(r) Operating Software (GCOS) software (Affymetrix Inc., USA)."
