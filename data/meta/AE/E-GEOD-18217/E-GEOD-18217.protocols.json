Salt treatment started at 14 DAS . Plants were watered from below to field capacity and then sprayed with the same concentration of NaCl solution from the top, ensuring adequate leaching and preventing excess salinity. The concentrations of NaCl supplementation were increased stepwise by 50 mM every 2 days for each line, to the indicated maximum (0, 100 mM). Plants were then watered every 2 days with or without NaCl at the indicated concentrations. The flats were rotated in the growth chamber everyday to minimize the effect of growth condition.","type":"specified_biomaterial_action","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0},{"id":41878,"accession":"P-GSE18217-3","name":"P-GSE18217-3","text":"Seeds of both transgenic and wild type plants were sown as described above with two replicate pots for each genotype and salt combination.
