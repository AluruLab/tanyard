Investigation Title	Rosette iron deficiency transcript profiling in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Kas-1 and Tsu-1							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Rosette iron deficiency transcript profiling in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Kas-1 and Tsu-1							
Experiment Description	Iron (Fe) is an essential plant micronutrient, and its deficiency limits plant growth and development on alkaline soils.  Under Fe deficiency, plant responses include upregulation of genes involved in Fe uptake from the soil.  However, little is known about shoot responses to Fe deficiency.  Using microarrays to probe gene expression in Kas-1 and Tsu-1 ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed conserved rosette gene expression responses to Fe deficiency. Fe regulated genes included known metal homeostasis-related genes, and a number of genes of unknown function. Kas and Tsu Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on complete media for 24 d, and then put on complete or -Fe media and collected after 24 and 48 h.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 rma signal	Done according the manufacturer’s protocol	Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Kas-1 and Tsu-1 were imbibed in 0.1% agar at 4degreesC for 72 h, planted onto rockwool, and grown on hydroponic solution. Lighting was provided at a photoperiod of 16 h of 150 umol m-2 s-1 4,100K fluorescent light. The ecotypes used are Kas-1 and Tsu-1 for our study, the citation of Schuler (2011) used Columbia-0.	R/Bioconductor. Normalized with rma	Done according the manufacturer’s protocol	24 d old plants were transferred to treatments of +Fe (50 uM Fe(III)-EDDHA) or -Fe for 24 or 48 h.	Total RNA was isolated from whole rosettes using the RNeasy Plant Kit (Qiagen), and quality was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.	Done according the manufacturer’s protocol
