Under Fe deficiency, plant responses include upregulation of genes involved in Fe uptake from the soil.  However, little is known about shoot responses to Fe deficiency.  Using microarrays to probe gene expression in Kas-1 and Tsu-1 ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed conserved rosette gene expression responses to Fe deficiency. Fe regulated genes included known metal homeostasis-related genes, and a number of genes of unknown function. Kas and Tsu Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on complete media for 24 d, and then put on complete or -Fe media and collected after 24 and 48 h."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Samuel A McInturf","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Brian M Waters","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Samuel Alonzo McInturf","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Ricardo J Stein","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":22962679,"authors":"Waters BM, McInturf SA, Stein RJ","title":"Rosette iron deficiency transcript and microRNA profiling reveals links between copper and iron homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana."}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Kas-1","Tsu-1"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root","shoot"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"ecotype","value":["Kas-1","Tsu-1"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["control","iron deprivation"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["root","shoot"]},{"name":"time","value":["24 hour","48 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":36,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1126878,"accession":"P-GSE39268-1"},{"id":1126881,"accession":"P-GSE39268-6"},{"id":1126880,"accession":"P-GSE39268-7"},{"id":1126879,"accession":"P-GSE39268-8"},{"id":1126883,"accession":"P-GSE39268-2"},{"id":1126884,"accession":"P-GSE39268-3"},{"id":1126885,"accession":"P-GSE39268-4"},{"id":1126882,"accession":"P-GSE39268-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":36,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":36,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":36,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":36,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":36,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":36,"isderived":0}]}]}}
