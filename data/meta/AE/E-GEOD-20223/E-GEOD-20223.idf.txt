Experiment Description	The plant hormone gibberellin (GA) represents an important regulator of growth and development. Early transcriptional events controlled by GA are not well characterised. Previous microarray studies have identified genes responsive to GA treatment in the whole seedling. The whole seedling represents many tissues where subtle effects of GA treatment in specific tissues may be masked. When treated with GA, an effect on the growth rate of roots was observed. More specifically, the shorter root of a GA-deficient plant can be rescued to wild-type length by the application of GA. This experiment was designed to identify GA-regulated genes in the root tips of Arabidopsis. The use of a GA-deficient mutant provides a greater potential to identify genes responding to GA treatment. Root tips are ideally suited for the quick uptake of the hormone treatment. There will be two biological replicates which will each consist of a control treatment at 0 minutes and 2 hours, as well as the experimental GA-treated 2 hour time point. This system provides an opportunity to compare gene expression between treated and non-treated root tips and allow the identification of early GA-responsive genes. 6 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	Roots were grown on 100mm x 100mm square plates stood at an angle of 70รยบ from the horizontal. Plants were grown on 0.7% Gelrite (Duchefa), 0.05% MES (Sigma), 1x Murashige and Skoog (Duchefa), 1% Sucrose (Duchefa) at pH 5.8. Plants were grown in continuous light and harvested when they were 7 days old.	Labelled using protocol described in manual "Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual", One-Cycle target labelling	Biotin Labelled cRNA using "Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit", according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0-calculated signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call
