Experiment Description	We collected globular stage seed compartments from 5 or 7-micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments of an Arabidopsis seed containing a globular stage embryo. For the purposes of this study we broke down the seed into 7 capturable compartments: embyro proper, suspensor, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat and general seed coat. Experiment Overall Design: Globular stage seed compartments were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 15 samples (Embryo Proper, Micropylar Endosperm, Peripheral Endosperm, General Seed Coat and Chalazal Seed Coat, 2 biological replicates each and Chalazal Endosperm with 3 biological replicates).

Protocol Description	Plants were grown in a Conviron chamber under continuous light with fluorescent lamps at 20Â&deg;C and 50% - 70% relative humidity.	Siliques with length between 1.1 and 1.4 cm containing globular stage seeds were collected from 38-46 day old plants. Seeds were either dissected out of siliques or left in sub-divided siliques and fixed in 3:1 (v/v) ethanol to acetic acid and embedded in paraffin.  Microdissection of compartments was carried out on 5 or 7 um sections using a Leica LMD6000 system. Compartments were only captured from seeds with globular embryos 24-32 um in diameter, as determined by a medial section through the embryo proper.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNaqueous Micro-Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) using a modified protocol incorporating an on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen RNase-Free DNase Set) during column washes.	2 to 4 ng of total RNA was amplified using the WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA). cDNAs were fragmented and labeled with NuGEN FL-Ovationâ¢ cDNA Biotin Module V2.
