Investigation Title	Expression data from Arabidopsis during de-etiolation						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis during de-etiolation
Experiment Description	Arabidopsis fc2-1 mutants fail to properly de-etiolate after a prolonged period in the dark. Our goal was to monitor whole genome expression during the first 2 hours of de-etiolation to determine the cuase of this growth arrest. In comparison with other mutants that also affect de-etiolation, we identified a subset of genes specifically regulated by FC2 function during de-etiolation. Seedlings were grown in the dark for 4 days and then exposed to white light for 30 or 120 minutes to initiate de-etiolation and photomorphogenesis

Protocol Description	Data was RMA pre-processed using the Chipster 2.0 open source platform (pre-set Affymetrix normalization) to generate normalized expression values and to identify genes that show a reliable level of RNA. ID_REF =  VALUE = LOG2 RMA signal	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared using the GeneChip 3’ IVT Express Kit from 450 ng total RNA (Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 12.5 ug of cRNA were hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array using the GeneChip Hybridization, Wash, and Stain Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	For 30 and 120 minute light treatments, plates were unwrapped and exposed to 120 μmol m-2 sec-1 at 22°C for the indicated amount of time.	Seeds were plated onto Linsmaier and Skoog medium pH 5.7 with 0.6% micropropagation type-1 agar powder. After a 4 day stratification in the dark at 4°C, plates were exposed to 120 μmol m-2 sec-1 at 22°C for 2 hours to initiate germination. Plates were then wrapped in aluminum foil and seedlings were grown in the dark for 4 days at 22°C.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions	Arrays were scanned using a GeneChip scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix)
