The hda9-1 mutant has reduced primary seed dormancy. We used microarrays to dissect which genes are differentially expressed in the hda9-1 mutant to study the mechanisms how HDA9 affects seed dormancy and germination RNA was extracted from tagged dry 18-19-DAP siliques of wild-type Col and the hda9-1 mutant following an adapted protocol of the RNAqueous small scale Phenol-free total RNA isolation kit in addition with RNA isolation aid (Ambion, Austing, TX, USA), as described in Liu et al. (2011) PLoS ONE and Van Zanten et al. (2011) PNAS. Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome-Micro hybridization was performed at the Max Planck Genome Centre Cologne.
