Comment[Submitted Name]	Comparison of histone deacetylase 9-1 mutant (SALK_001723) dry seed transcriptome with Col wild-type						
Experiment Description	Analysis of the transcriptome of dry hda9-1 mutant seeds with those of Col wild-type seeds, using Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. The hda9-1 mutant has reduced primary seed dormancy. We used microarrays to dissect which genes are differentially expressed in the hda9-1 mutant to study the mechanisms how HDA9 affects seed dormancy and germination RNA was extracted from tagged dry 18-19-DAP siliques of wild-type Col and the hda9-1 mutant following an adapted protocol of the RNAqueous small scale Phenol-free total RNA isolation kit in addition with RNA isolation aid (Ambion, Austing, TX, USA), as described in Liu et al. (2011) PLoS ONE and Van Zanten et al. (2011) PNAS. Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome-Micro hybridization was performed at the Max Planck Genome Centre Cologne. Three independent hybridizations of independent biological replicates, obtained from several dry siliques of at least five plants per replica, were performed.

Protocol Description	The RMA algorithm implemented in R package AFFY was used for background correction, normalization and expression calculation. Statistical analysis of the normalized data were performed using R packages LIMMA and RankProd ID_REF =  VALUE = Log2 RMA signal intensity	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Ambion protocol from 1 ug total RNA (MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced Kit, 2008, Ambion)	After fragmentation, 12.5 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained with Fluidics Script FS450_004 in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450	Dry seeds were used obtained from 18-19 day-old (days after polination) ripe siliques	Plants were grown on soil containing a mixture of substrate and vermiculite (3:1) in growth cabinets (Elbanton BV, Kerkdriel, The Netherlands) in 16h light at 22degreesC and 8h dark at 16degreesC	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G
