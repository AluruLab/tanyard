The flower buds that are <1, 1, 2, 3 and >3 mm were harvested. All harvested samples including stamens and pistils were removed and immediately (<2 sec) frozen in liquid nitrogen to minimize post-harvest changes in gene expression. Flower buds were collected from at least two different biological repetitions within each line, from between two and four inflorescences on each plant, and from between two and four different plants from each line. Different flower bud samples were collected at approximately the same time of the day to avoid diurnal effects on gene expression.","type":"specified_biomaterial_action","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":420608,"accession":"P-G9721-3","name":"P-G9721-3","text":"Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":420609,"accession":"P-G9721-4","name":"P-G9721-4","text":"Total RNA was isolated from flower buds using Trizol reagent following instructions from the manufacturer (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and was then purified on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
