Protocol Description	Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy plant kit according to the manufacture'’s instructions (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). The nucleic acid integrity was assessed by evaluating ribosomal RNA bands on agarose gels, and its quality was determined by calculating the 260/280 and 260/230 spectrophotometric ratios. When necessary, the RNA was cleaned further by phenol/chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction, followed by precipitation with 0.15 M sodium acetate, 50% (v/v) isopropanol.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Seeds were grown on Petri dishes containing one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog basal media with Gamborg’s vitamins (pH 5.75; Sigma, St. Louis) and 0.8% (w/v) agar. Aminoethylvinyl-Gly (5 uM) was included in the growth media to inhibit ethylene biosynthesis by the seedlings. After a 2-d cold treatment at 4 C, plates were brought to 22 C and exposed to light for 16 hours. Plates were then placed in 4-L chambers and seedlings grown in the dark. Seedlings were examined after 4 d, time 0 corresponding to when the plates were removed from 4 C and brought to 22 C. <br>(Parameters: start time = 4, time unit = days, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C)	Seedlings were grown in sealed containers in the presence or absence of 1 uL/L ethylene. To examine the growth of seedlings in the absence of ethylene, hydrocarbon-free air was passed through the chamber to remove trace amounts of ethylene synthesized by the seedlings.
