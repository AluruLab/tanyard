Comment[ArrayExpressAccession]	E-GEOD-48114						MAGE-TAB Version	1.1						Public Release Date	2014-03-31						Investigation Title	Pre-mRNA splicing factor atsf1-2 mutant seedlings						Comment[Submitted Name]	Pre-mRNA splicing factor atsf1-2 mutant seedlings						Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis wild type and atsf1-2 mutant seedlings						Experiment Description	"Analysis of atsf1-2 mutant seedlings for pre-mRNA splicing defect.  The atsf1-2 mutant is a homozygous T-DNA insertion line isolated from a SALK line, SALK_062177.  Results identify transcripts with altered alternative splicing pattern in the atsf1-2 mutant. We used microarrays to examine the transcriptome profile in the atsf1-2 mutant and identified genes of  which transcript levels were changed significantly. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 9 days under long day condition.  They were then used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix ATH1 Genome Array.  Three replicates for Col-0 (control) and atsf1-2 (mutant) were compared respectively."						Term Source Name	ArrayExpress	EFO					Term Source File	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/efo.owl					Person Last Name	Kim	Jang	Kim				Person First Name	Jeong-Kook	Yun-Hee	Jeong-Kook				Person Email	jkkim@korea.ac.kr						Person Affiliation	Korea University						Person Address	"Life Sciences, Korea University, 5-1, Anam-Dong, Seongbuk-Gu, Seoul, South Korea"						Person Roles	submitter						Protocol Name	P-GSE48114-1	P-GSE48114-5	P-GSE48114-6	P-GSE48114-2	P-GSE48114-3	P-GSE48114-4	P-GSE48114-7Protocol Description	"The Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) algorithm implemented in Affymetrix Expression Console software (version1.2) was used to normalize the raw data. To reduce noise for the significance analysis, probe sets that were called &quot;Present&quot; by the MAS5 detection call in 100% of the samples were selected.  Highly expressed genes that showed over 2-fold difference between the signal values of control and test samples were selected for further study. ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M) DETECTION P-VALUE = "	"Biotinylated cDNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 300 ng total RNA (GeneChip 3 IVT Express Kit User Manual P/N 702646 Rev. 1, Affymetrix)."	"Following fragmentation, fragmented cDNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome Array. The GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450."	No treatment	The Col-0 and atsf1-2 mutant seeds were plated on MS agar plates. Seedlings were grown at 23 C with 16-h light and 8-h dark cycles for 9 days before being harvested.
