Experiment Description	At 3 days after pollination, RNA was extracted from seeds of WT and fis2 mutants, labeled and hybridized to ATH1 arrays.					
Protocol Name	P-TABM-4739	P-TABM-4738	P-TABM-5194	P-TABM-4740	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown	P-AFFY-6
Protocol Type	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	pool	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction
Protocol Description	Plants were grown in growth chambers at 70% humidity and daily cycles of 16 h light and 8 h darkness at the specified temperature.	Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen Plant RNeasy MiniKit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The quality of the isolated RNA was determined with a NanoDrop ND 1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Delaware, USA) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). Only samples with a 260 nm/280 nm ratio between 1.82.1 and a 28S/18S ratio within 1.52 were processed further.	Seeds of at least 20 siliques per sample was pooled per replicate	One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix, P/N 900431, Santa Clara, CA)	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
