Protocol Description	Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were grown in a controlled room for 28 days at 22oC, 60% relative humidity, 75 uE light and 12 hr photoperiod.	Seedlings were grown in walk-in room on the top shelf for 8 days in MS liquid medium	Isolated protoplasts (0.4 million) were incubated in 10 ml 0.5 M mannitol, 4 mM MES pH 5.7 and 20 mM KCl for 4 hr at 28oC before treatment with 100 nM flg22 for 30 min and 60 min.	Protoplasts (0.8 - 2 million) were transfected with 1 mg DNA/ml protoplasts using PEG-calcium and incubated in 10 ml 0.5 M mannitol, 4 mM MES pH 5.7 and 20 mM KCl for 6 hr at 25oC.	Treated with 2nM flg22 for 30 and 60 min.	Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerâs protocol	Total RNA (1.5-4.5 Âµg) were amplified, biotinylated and fragmented using the BioArrayTM HighYieldTM RNA transcript labelling kit (Enzo) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.	Total RNA (10 Âµg) were amplified, biotinylated and fragmented using the BioArrayTM HighYieldTM RNA transcript labelling kit (Enzo) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.	Total RNA (9.0 Âµg) were amplified, biotinylated and fragmented using the BioArrayTM HighYieldTM RNA transcript labelling kit (Enzo) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized on the Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChips using the Affymetrix 640 Hybridization Oven. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	GeneChips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 7G with AutoLoader.	The data were analyzed in FlexArray with RMA including background correction and normalization.	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA log(2) signal intensity
