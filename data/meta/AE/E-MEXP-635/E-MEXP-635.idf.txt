Experiment Description	We compared the root transcription profiles to determine the effects of loss-of-function of the BRX gene of Arabidopsis. BRX is required for optimal root growth. We compared roots of a loss-of-function line (brx) with its control background (Sav-0). Because the loss-of-function line was derived from introgression, a brx line that was complemented by a transgenic wild type copy of BRX was also included as a control. This line (rescued brx) allows the identification of expression differences that are due to introgression drag. See Mouchel et al. 2004, Genes & Dev. Vol. 18, p. 700 for a detailed description.
