BRX is required for optimal root growth. We compared roots of a loss-of-function line (brx) with its control background (Sav-0). Because the loss-of-function line was derived from introgression, a brx line that was complemented by a transgenic wild type copy of BRX was also included as a control. This line (rescued brx) allows the identification of expression differences that are due to introgression drag. See Mouchel et al. 2004, Genes & Dev. Vol. 18, p. 700 for a detailed description."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Karen S Osmont","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Céline F Mouchel","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Christian Hardtke","role":"submitter","email":"christian.hardtke@unil.ch"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":17006513,"authors":"Céline F Mouchel; Karen S Osmont; Christian S Hardtke","title":"BRX mediates feedback between brassinosteroid levels and auxin signalling in root growth","status":"journal_article"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":[6]},{"category":"BioSourceType","value":["fresh_sample"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["1.02 Boyes key"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Sav-0"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["brx","brx complemented by BRX transgene","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["root"]},{"category":"TimeUnit","value":["days"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["brx","brx complemented by BRX transgene","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":546009,"accession":"P-MEXP-21973"},{"id":88450,"accession":"P-MEXP-22034"},{"id":88451,"accession":"P-MEXP-21985"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
