Investigation Title	Transcript profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana swi3d mutant with inactivated SWI3D subunit of SWI/SNF complex					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcript profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana swi3d mutant with inactivated SWI3D subunit of SWI/SNF complex
Experiment Description	SWI3D subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) is involved in the control of Arabidopsis development. We found, using microarray analysis that inactivation of SWI3D gene caused altered expression of genes belonging to various regulatory pathways, including metabolism, stress, response to hormone and development. On the basis of this experiment and our other data we concluded that Arabidopsis SWI3D modulates major regulatory pathways.

Protocol Description	Plants were frozen in LN immediately after harvesting and ground into a fine powder.	Plants were grown under long-day (LD) or short-day (SD) conditions (16h light/8h dark or 8h light/16h dark, respectively) at 22/19Â°C, 70% humidity.	RNA was extracted using RNeasy plant kit (Qiagen) and 150ng of total RNA were used to further analysis.	Nucleic acids were labeled by biotin-labeling with the IVT labeling kit (GeneChip 3'IVT Express; Affymetrix)	The labeled nucleic acids were hybridised to array for 16h as recommended by the supplier (Gene expression analysis manual; Affymetrix).	The data normalisation (RMA- summarisation method) was done using GeneSpring GX software according to guided workflow.
