We found, using microarray analysis that inactivation of SWI3D gene caused altered expression of genes belonging to various regulatory pathways, including metabolism, stress, response to hormone and development. On the basis of this experiment and our other data we concluded that Arabidopsis SWI3D modulates major regulatory pathways.
