Protocol Type	pool	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	
Protocol Description	apices of 35 plants were pooled for each replicate; all plants were grown at the same timepoint	Plants were grown on soil for 25 days under short day conditions (8/16)  at 23°C and  65% relative humidity. Flowering was induced by shifting to long day conditions (16/8) also 23°C and 65% relative humidity. Samples were taken at day 0, 3, 5 and 7 after shifting.	pdf of the protocol (Probe preparation Development) can be downloaded at http://www.weigelworld.org/resources/microarray/AtGenExpress/; also at TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org Protocol:501712557	pdf of the protocol (Probe preparation Development) can be downloaded at http://www.weigelworld.org/resources/microarray/AtGenExpress/; also at TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org Protocol:501712557	Title: Affymetrix EukGE-WS2v4_450 Hybridization.
