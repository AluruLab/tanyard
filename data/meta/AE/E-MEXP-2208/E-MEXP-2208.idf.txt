Protocol Description	Total RNA was isolated from the frozen material using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Valencia, California, United States). Probes for hybridization were then prepared from the total RNA according to standard Affymetrix protocol and hybridized on Affymetrix ATH1 microarray chip.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = polyA_RNA, Amplification = none)	A mixed-model analysis of variance was performed to identify differentially expressed genes. In this approach, a global normalization step was applied to minimize general array-level effects by centering the mean of the log2-transformed values to zero for each array. Outlier probes with values greater than two standard deviations from the probe-set mean were then removed. Next, a mixed-model ANOVA was applied to the transformed and centered intensity values obtained from the global normalization step. respectively. The array effect Al(j) is assumed to be a normally distributed random effect. A standard error term ?jkl was also applied to this model. The output of this model is the mean expression value for every gene, based on the global model, as well as a p-value from the gene model for the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no-differential expression (? = .05). The global and gene models were run on a Linux server with the statistical software SAS (version 8.2).	Arabidopsis thaliana lines in the Columbia (Col-0)ecotype were used. Seeds were surface-sterilized for 8 min in a 0.9% dichloroisocyanuric acid solution. The solution was prepared by adding 440 mg of dichloroisocyanuric acid dissolved in 5 ml of water to 45 ml of ethanol. The seeds were then washed twice in 95% ethanol and left to dry overnight. They were then germinated on plates containing 1� Murashige and Skoog salt mixture, 8.9 mM thiamine, 40.6 mM nicotinic acid, 2.4 mM pyrridoxin, 0.56 mM myo-inositol, 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 2.3 mM 2-( N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (pH 5.8) in 1% agar. For the plants grown for the microarray experiments, a layer of nylon mesh (Sefar, 03�100/47) was added on top of the agar to facilitate transfer onto treatment media and/or root dissection.<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)
