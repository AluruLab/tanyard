Next, a mixed-model ANOVA was applied to the transformed and centered intensity values obtained from the global normalization step. respectively. The array effect Al(j) is assumed to be a normally distributed random effect. A standard error term ?jkl was also applied to this model. The output of this model is the mean expression value for every gene, based on the global model, as well as a p-value from the gene model for the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no-differential expression (? = .05).
