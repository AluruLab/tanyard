Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from stem samples taken from the base and the first internode of Arabidopsis wildtype and wox4-1 plants							
Experiment Description	Stem samples of wildtype Columbia plants and the wox4-1 mutant (Gabi_462G01) were analyzed in order to draw a connection between general transcriptomic changes during interfascicular formation in the wildtype and WOX4-dependent gene regulation during this process. We used microarrays to identify factors downstream of WOX4 in the formation of the interfascicular cambium. Transcriptional profiling, comparing wildtype Columbia and wox4-1 plants. RNA was extracted from 3 biological replicates per plant line and sample type (stem base, first internode), each consisting of a pool of 13-17 stem samples.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA signal intensity	Following fragmentation, the aRNAs were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on the GeneChip ATH1 array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	Plants were grown for 3 weeks on short days (8 hours light, 16 hours dark) under standard conditions and then switched to long days (16 hours light, 8 hours dark).	The data were analyzed using the RMA method on the Bioconductor statistical package (R).	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.	15-20 cm tall wildtype Columbia and wox4-1 plants with a first internode of at least 3.5 cm in length were used for the experiment. Stem fragments of 0.5 cm in length were harvested from the base of Arabidopsis plants and from the region between 1.5 and 2.0 cm above the uppermost rosette leaf, respectively. RNA was extracted from 3 biological replicates per plant line and sample type, each consisting of a pool of 13-17 stem samples.	Total RNA was extracted from frozen, grinded plant material by agitating with 1 ml of TRIZOL. After centrifuging, 900 µl of the supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes, containing 200 µl of chloroform each. Phases were separated by centrifugation for 15 min at maximum speed in a table centrifuge. Subsequenty, the aqueous layer was transferred to 500 µl isopropanol. RNA was precipitated and the pellet washed with 70% ethanol, prior to column purification using the RNeasy Mini Kit in combination with the RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN) and following the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated aRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
