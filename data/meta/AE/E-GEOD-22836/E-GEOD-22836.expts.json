For this purpose we used DEX-inducible system and studied the expression profile 5h after treatment using Affymetrix microarray.  Keywords: genetic modification Arabidopsis  46 day-old transgenic plants (Arabidopsis C24 background, inducible overexpression)  were sprayed with 30ÂµM  DEX for 5h. As control mock (0.05% ethanol) treated  ORS1-inducible over-expression plants were used. Whole rosettes were harvested 5h after induction and used for expression profiling using Affymetrix near-full genome ATH1 arrays. Experiment performed in two biological replications."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Salma Balazadeh","role":"submitter","email":"balazadeh@mpimp-golm.mpg.de"},{"contact":"Salma Balazadeh","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Bernd Mueller-Roeber","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Ecotype","value":["C24"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["ORS1 inducible"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["rosette leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND","value":["dexamethasone","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":444886,"accession":"P-GSE22836-4"},{"id":444888,"accession":"P-GSE22836-3"},{"id":444889,"accession":"P-GSE22836-2"},{"id":444885,"accession":"P-GSE22836-1"},{"id":444890,"accession":"P-GSE22836-8"},{"id":444892,"accession":"P-GSE22836-7"},{"id":444891,"accession":"P-GSE22836-6"},{"id":444887,"accession":"P-GSE22836-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0}]}]}}
