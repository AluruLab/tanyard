Investigation Title	Identification of ORS1 target genes using inducible overexpression system							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Identification of ORS1 target genes using inducible overexpression system							
Experiment Description	The aim was to identify early target genes of the senescence-associated transcription factor: ORS1. For this purpose we used DEX-inducible system and studied the expression profile 5h after treatment using Affymetrix microarray.  Keywords: genetic modification Arabidopsis  46 day-old transgenic plants (Arabidopsis C24 background, inducible overexpression)  were sprayed with 30µM  DEX for 5h. As control mock (0.05% ethanol) treated  ORS1-inducible over-expression plants were used. Whole rosettes were harvested 5h after induction and used for expression profiling using Affymetrix near-full genome ATH1 arrays. Experiment performed in two biological replications.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = GCRMA normalized	performed by Atlas Biolabs	Transgenic plants were grown in soil and germinated under controlled condition in a growth chamber with a 16-h day lenght provided by fluorescent light at 80 or 120 µmol m2- s1- and a days/night temperature of 20/16 C°  and relative humidity 60/75%.	The data were analyzed with GCRMA (Wu et al., 2004).	performed by Atlas Biolabs	46 days-old transgenic Arabidopsis rosette were sprayed with 30µM DEX for 5 hours and then whole rosettes were carefully harvested. As control, 46 days-old transgenic Arabidopsis rosette were sprayed with 0.05% ethanol (mock) for 5 hours.	RNA extraction performed using Rneasy Plant MiniKit (Qiagene)	Labling procedure performed using MessageAmpTM II-Biotin Enhanced Kit
