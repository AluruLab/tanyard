Investigation Title	Sucrose modulation of the Arabidopsis thaliana guard-cell transcriptome							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Sucrose modulation of the Arabidopsis thaliana guard-cell transcriptome							
Experiment Description	Microarrays were used to evaluate the effect of sucrose on gene expression in guard cells.  Strips of Arabidopsis leaves were incubated with sucrose or mannitol or no sugars, then the leaves were freeze dried and guard cells were dissected from the leaf strips and analyzed. RNA was extracted from guard cells dissected from leaf strips that had been treated with sucrose or with mannitol or no sugars as controls.  Triplicate biological replicates were prepared for the treatments and controls.  The RNA was amplified twice with T7 RNA polymerase and hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = Log2 GCRMA signal intensity	Biotin-labeled RNA was fragmented, and hybridized to ATH1 GeneChips according to Affymetrixâ€™s instructions (see Affymetrix user manuals P/N 702232 and P/N 702731). The arrays were washed and stained with R-phycoerythrin streptavidin in the GeneChip Fluidics Station 400.	rosette leaves from 8-10 week old plants grown at 22 degrees C, 60% RH, 150 microE per meter per sec fluorescent light, 8h light/16h dark diurnal cycles	The CEL files were imported in the R environment and analyzed by Bioconductor packages. Quality assessment for evaluation of the overall data coherence was performed with the Affy and AffyQCReport packages, and the raw data were background-corrected, and normalized by GCRMA	Arrays were scanned with a Hewlett Packard GeneArray Scanner.	1 mm wide leaf strips were floated on 150 mM sucrose or mannitol solutions containing 50 mM KCl and 0.1 mM CaCl2, vacuum inflitrated (25kPa for 30 sec), and incubated for 5 h at 22 degrees C, under fluorscent lights (30 microE per meter per sec). Leaf strips were blotted dry, frozen on liquid nitrogen, freeze dried for 4 days, and stored under vacuum at -20 degrees C. Guard cell pairs were manually dissected from the leaf strips under a dissecting microscope at 50X magnification.	RNA was isolated from samples of 50 to 100 guard cell pairs with the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus) according to the manufacturer's instructions including treatment with DNase during the isolation.	RNA was amplified twice with the MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions, biotin-11-UTP was included in the second round of amplification.
