Experiment Description	We performed an expression analysis of the response of seedling root tips to 1 hour of treatment with 140mM NaCl using mutants defective in root hair patterning. Cells are amazingly adept at integrating both external and internal cues to regulate transcriptional states.  While internal processes such as differentiation and cell-type specification are generally understood to have an important impact on gene expression, very little is known about how cells utilize these developmental cues to regulate responses to external stimuli.  Here we use the response to a well characterized environmental stress, high salinity, to obtain a global view of the role that cell identity plays in guiding transcriptional responses in the root of Arabidopsis.  Our analysis is based on three microarray data sets we have generated that explore transcriptional changes spatially among 6 cell layers and 4 longitudinal regions or temporally along 5 time points after salt treatment.  We show that the majority of the response to salt stress is cell-type specific resulting in the differential regulation of unique biological functions in subsets of cell layers.  To understand the regulatory mechanisms controlling these responses we have analyzed cis-element enrichment in the promoters of salt responsive genes and demonstrate that known stress regulatory elements likely control responses to salt occurring in multiple cell types.  Despite the extensive shift in transcriptional state that salt stress elicits, we are able to identify several biological processes that consistently define each cell layer and find that transcriptional regulators of cell-identity tend to exhibit robust cell-type specific expression.  Finally, using mutants that disrupt cell-type specification in the epidermis, we reveal cell autonomous and non-autonomous effects when cell identity is altered.  Together, these data elucidate a novel intersection between physiology and development and expand our understanding of how transcriptional states are regulated in a multi-cellular context. Experiment Overall Design: Seedlings were grown for 5 days before being transferred to standard media or media supplemented with 140mM NaCl.  One hour after transfer, a razor blade was used to cut the root ~5 mm above the root tip.  Approximately 30 roots were pooled per replicate.  Two biological replicates were performed per genotype, per condition.

Protocol Description	Seedlings were grown for 5 days before being transferred to standard media or media supplemented with 140mM NaCl.  One hour after transfer, a razor blade was used to cut the root ~5 mm above the root tip.  Approximately 30 roots were pooled per replicate.  Two biological replicates were performed per genotype, per condition.  Samples were briefly sonicated to disrupt the tissue.	Seeds were surface sterilized with 50% Bleach and 0.1% Tween for 5 minutes and then rinsed 3 times with sterile water.  Seeds were stratified at 4ËC for 2 days before being planted on standard media.  Standard media is 1X concentration Murashige and Skoog salt mixture (Caisson laboratories), 0.5g/L MES, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH.  Salt media is standard media with varying amounts of NaCl added.  Nylon mesh was placed on top of the solidified media and seeds were evenly placed on the mesh in a single row at a density of ~2/cm for all experiments.	Approximately 30 roots were collected per replicate.  Samples were briefly sonicated to disrupt the tissue.  RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH).	Fragmented cRNA probes were prepared using the one-cycle amplification protocol by Affymetrix.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
