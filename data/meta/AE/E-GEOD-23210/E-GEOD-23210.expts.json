The results implicate endosomal NHX antiporters in novel cellular functions. In order to investigate further the possible functions of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6, we compared the transcrptional profiles of single and double AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 knockouts. We looked for changes in gene expression might help us to elucidate the molecular events associated with the apparent requirement of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 for normal growth and development. Rosette leaves from 4 weeks old plants grown on soil under normal conditons and 8h L \/ 16 D were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarray chips."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Elias Bassil","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Eduardo Blumwald","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"elias bassil","role":"submitter","email":"esbassil@ucdavis.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21278129,"authors":"Bassil E, Ohto MA, Esumi T, Tajima H, Zhu Z, Cagnac O, Belmonte M, Peleg Z, Yamaguchi T, Blumwald E.","title":"The Arabidopsis intracellular Na+\/H+ antiporters NHX5 and NHX6 are endosome associated and necessary for plant growth and development."}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["4 week"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Colombia"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["nhx5-1\/nhx6-1 double knock out","nhx5-2 knock out","nhx5-2\/nhx6-2 double knock out","nhx6-2 knock out","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["rosette leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["nhx5-1\/nhx6-1 double knock out","nhx5-2 knock out","nhx5-2\/nhx6-2 double knock out","nhx6-2 knock out","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":15,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1128038,"accession":"P-GSE23210-2"},{"id":1128039,"accession":"P-GSE23210-3"},{"id":1128033,"accession":"P-GSE23210-1"},{"id":1128035,"accession":"P-GSE23210-6"},{"id":1128034,"accession":"P-GSE23210-7"},{"id":1128037,"accession":"P-GSE23210-4"},{"id":1128036,"accession":"P-GSE23210-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":15,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":15,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":15,"isderived":0}]}]}}
