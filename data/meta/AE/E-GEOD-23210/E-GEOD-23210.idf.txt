Investigation Title	Expression data in single and double knockouts of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 in Arabidopsis						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data in single and double knockouts of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 in Arabidopsis						
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 single and double knock out mutants						
Experiment Description	"We generated single and double knockouts of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 in order to invesigate possible functions in Arabidopsis. nhx5/nhx6 exhibited severe growth retardation related to cell size and proliferation, as well as endosomal trafficking perutrbations. The results implicate endosomal NHX antiporters in novel cellular functions. In order to investigate further the possible functions of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6, we compared the transcrptional profiles of single and double AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 knockouts. We looked for changes in gene expression might help us to elucidate the molecular events associated with the apparent requirement of AtNHX5 and AtNHX6 for normal growth and development. Rosette leaves from 4 weeks old plants grown on soil under normal conditons and 8h L / 16 D were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarray chips."

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Log2 normalized signal intensity	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.	"Following fragmentation, 10 ug of aRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400."	Qiagen extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Plants were grown in Metromix300 soil in 18-pot trays in a growth chamber with 8h L/16h D and fertilized weekly beginning week 2.	"Biotinylated aRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix)."	The data were normalized using JMPGenomics (ver 3.0) with STD normalization and background correction feature.
