Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis pam48 (mterf6-1) mutants						
Investigation Title	Expression data from pam48 (mterf6-1) mutants						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from pam48 (mterf6-1) mutants						
Experiment Description	Of the members of mitochondrial transcription termination factors (mTERFs) found in metazoans and plants known to regulate organellar gene expression at various levels, plant mTERF6 promotes maturation of a tRNA We used microarrays to analyze whole-genome transcriptome changes in pam48 (mterf6-1) mutants compared to wild type. Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and pam48 (mterf6-1) leaves were harvested at the 8-leaf stage for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with Flexarry and RMA as normalization method. ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA signal intensity	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on ATH1 Genome Array in a Hyridisation Oven 640. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	Leaves of the same age of plants from the 8-leaf-rosette stage were harvested and frozen directly in liquid N2.	A. thaliana plants were grown on potting soil (Stender) under controlled greenhouse conditions (daylight was supplemented with illumination from HQI Powerstar 400W/D, providing a total fluence of ~120 µmol photons m-2 s-1 on leaf surfaces and a 16/8 h light/dark cycle). Wuxal Super fertilizer (8% N, 8% P2O5, and 6% K2O; MANNA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Rneasy plant mini kit (QIAGEN) extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000
