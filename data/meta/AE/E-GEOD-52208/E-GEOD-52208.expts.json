Boron availability in soil is limited at many regions in the world, including Japan. Under boron deficient conditions, leaf expansion and root elongation, apical dominance, flower development,and fruit and seed sets are inhibited. In this work, we analyzed the mRNA expression of genes containing AUGUAA motif in their 5′-UTR, which is induced by boron. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression underlying boron deficiency in roots. Plants were grown on solid medium containing 1% (w\/v) sucrose, 1.5% (w\/v) gellan gum and 100 µM boron for 10 days and then transferred to 0.3 and 100 µM boron for 2 days. Plates were placed vertically at 22°C in a growth chamber under long-day conditions (16 h light\/8 h dark cycle). We analyzed the transcript profiles in roots by microarray analysis (Affymetrix ATH1 Genome Array)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Toru Fujiwara","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Masami Y Hirai","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Mayuki Tanaka","role":"submitter","email":"tanakamayuki@yahoo.co.jp"},{"contact":"Mayuki Tanaka","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["12 days old"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["bor1 single mutant","bor2 single mutant","nip5;1 and bor1 double mutant","nip5;1 and bor2 double mutant","nip5;1 and nip6;1 double mutant","nip5;1 single mutant","wild-type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root"]},{"category":"phenotype","value":["Inhibition of root and shoot that is similar to nip5;1-1 single mutant under limiting boron conditions.","Inhibition of root, shoot, flowers and siliques growth when boron was supplied at concentrations of less than10 microM.","Requires a high level of B.
