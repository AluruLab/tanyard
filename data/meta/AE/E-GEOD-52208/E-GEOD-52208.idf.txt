Investigation Title	Expression data from Arabidopsis root in response to boron limitation					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis root in response to boron limitation
Experiment Description	Boron is essential for plants, and boron availability in soil is an important determinant of agricultural production. Boron availability in soil is limited at many regions in the world, including Japan. Under boron deficient conditions, leaf expansion and root elongation, apical dominance, flower development,and fruit and seed sets are inhibited. In this work, we analyzed the mRNA expression of genes containing AUGUAA motif in their 5â€²-UTR, which is induced by boron. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression underlying boron deficiency in roots. Plants were grown on solid medium containing 1% (w/v) sucrose, 1.5% (w/v) gellan gum and 100 ÂµM boron for 10 days and then transferred to 0.3 and 100 ÂµM boron for 2 days. Plates were placed vertically at 22Â°C in a growth chamber under long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark cycle). We analyzed the transcript profiles in roots by microarray analysis (Affymetrix ATH1 Genome Array).
