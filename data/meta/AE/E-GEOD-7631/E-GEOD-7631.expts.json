One critical organ function is responding to internal or external change but little is known about how responses are tailored to specific cell types or coordinated among them on a global level. Here we use cellular profiling of five Arabidopsis root cell types in response to a limiting resource, nitrogen, to uncover a vast and predominantly cell-specific response that was largely undetectable using traditional methods. These methods reveal a new class of cell-specific nitrogen responses. As a proof-of-principle, we dissected one cell-specific response circuit that mediates nitrogen-induced changes in root branching from pericycle cells. Thus, cellular response profiling links gene modules to discrete functions in specific cell types. Experiment Overall Design: The whole experiment was carried out in triplicate with 84 chips in total (28 experiments).  The nitrogen response in 5 FACS-sorted root cell types (LRC, lateral root cap; EpiC, epidermis and cortex; EndoP, endodermis and pericycle; Peri, pericycle; Stele, stele), protoplasts and Col-0 whole roots was assayed using microarrays.  5mM KNO3 was used as a nitrogen treatment for 2 hours.  5mM KCl was used as a control treatment for the same length of time. 1mM MSX in combination with 5mM KNO3 (or with 5mM KCl as a control) was used to block the assimilation of KNO3, and 5mM Gln added to restore it in order to separate KNO3 effects from assimilated-nitrogen effects. 5mM KNO3 was either maintained in the protoplast-generating solution (continuous treat) or not (transitory treat) to test how to best preserve the cellular nitrogen-response during the 1 hr protoplast generating procedure. As controls we used protoplasts, whole roots frozen directly after the 2hr treatment or 3.5hr treatment, or whole roots incubated in protoplast-generating solution (minus enzymes; transitory or continuous treated) and then frozen. After FACS-sorting or mock FACS-sorting cells were frozen."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Kenneth David Birnbaum","role":"submitter","email":"ken.birnbaum@nyu.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":18180456,"authors":"Gifford ML, Dean A, Gutierrez RA, Coruzzi GM, Birnbaum KD","title":"Cell-specific nitrogen responses mediate developmental plasticity","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["12 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["endodermis and pericycle","epidermis and cortex","lateral root cap","pericycle","protoplast","stele","whole root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["2hr continuous KCl and MSX","2hr continuous KNO3","2hr continuous KNO3 and MSX","2hr continuous KNO3, MSX and Gln","2hr KCl then incubation in protoplast-generating solution minus enzymes","2hr KNO3 then frozen","2hr KNO3 then incubation in protoplast-generating solution minus enzymes","2hr KNO3 then incubation in protoplast-generating solution minus enzymes with KNO3","2hr transitory KNO3","3.5hr KCl then frozen","3.5hr KNO3 then frozen","control"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["endodermis and pericycle","epidermis and cortex","lateral root cap","pericycle","protoplast","stele","whole root"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":84,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1137032,"accession":"P-G7631-2"},{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":1137031,"accession":"P-G7631-1"},{"id":1137030,"accession":"P-G7631-4"},{"id":1137029,"accession":"P-G7631-3"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":84,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":84,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":84,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":84,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
