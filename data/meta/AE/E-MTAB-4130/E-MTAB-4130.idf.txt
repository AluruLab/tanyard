Experiment Description	The induction of flowering by the photoperiodic pathway (i.e. an increase in daylength) involves the production of systemic signals that induce the transition to reproductive development. In order to evaluate the early events occurring in the roots during the photoperiodic induction of flowering, we harvested the roots of 7 week-old Col-0 Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown plants exposed to a single 22-hour long day. Control plants were maintained under 8-hour short days. Plants were grown in hydroponics and roots tissues were harvested 16 and 22 hours after the beginning of the light period.

Protocol Description	Bioinformatic analyses were performed using R programming language (R Core Team). We analysed raw microarray (â.CELâ  les) data using the limma package (Ritchie et al., 2015). Data were GCRMA-normalized, and probesets were  filtered for an absolute expression level of at least 100 in â¥ 20 % of the arrays. We  fitted the data to a linear model using the ebayes() function and corrected the p-value for multiple testing using Benjamini and Hochbergâs method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We considered genes as being differentially expressed when the adjusted p-value was â¤ 0.01 and fold change â¥ 2.	Roots of 18 individual plants were harvested 16h and 22h after the beginning of the inductive 22-h LD and pooled. Sampling at the same times in 8-h SD happened during the dark period and were performed under dim green light. Roots were stored at -80Â°C until used.	Plants were grown in hydroponic device made of black containers and accessories (http://www.araponics.com). Nutrient solution was a mix of commercial stocks (0.5 ml l-1 FloraMicro, FloraGro and FloraBloom; http://www.generalhydroponics.com). Light was provided by fluorescent white tubes at 60 ÂµE.m-2.s-1 PPFD; temperature was 20Â°C (day/night) and air relative humidity 70%. Flowering was induced by a single 22-h LD after 7 weeks of growth in 8-h SD.	Tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen, and RNA was extracted with TRizol according to manufacturerâs instructions (www.lifetechnologies.com).  The quality of the RNA samples was assessed using the Experion(tm) automated electrophoresis system (www.bio-rad.com). All samples used for microarray analysis had an RNA quality indicator (RQI) of 10.	The RNA samples were labeled using 3â IVT Expressed kit according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Affymetrix, www.affymetrix.com).	15 Âµg of fragmented cRNA was used in a 300-Âµl hybridization mixture containing added hybridization controls. 200 Âµl was hybridized on arrays for 16 h at 45Â°C. Standard post-hybridization wash and double-stain protocols (EukGE-WS2v5_450) were used on an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450. ATH1 GeneChip hybridizations, were performed by the GIGA Genomics facility (GIGA, University of LiÃ¨ge, Belgium).	Three biological replicates obtained from independent experiments were hybridized on ATH1 Genome arrays (Affymetrix).The array scanning were performed by the GIGA Genomics facility (GIGA, University of LiÃ¨ge, Belgium), using a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).
