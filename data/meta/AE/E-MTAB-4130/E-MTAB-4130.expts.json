In order to evaluate the early events occurring in the roots during the photoperiodic induction of flowering, we harvested the roots of 7 week-old Col-0 Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown plants exposed to a single 22-hour long day. Control plants were maintained under 8-hour short days. Plants were grown in hydroponics and roots tissues were harvested 16 and 22 hours after the beginning of the light period."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Frédéric Bouché","role":"submitter","email":"bouche.fred@gmail.com"},{"contact":"Claire Périlleux","role":null,"email":"cperilleux@ulg.ac.be"},{"contact":"Pierre Tocquin","role":null,"email":"ptocquin@ulg.ac.be"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":27352932,"authors":"Bouché F, DAloia M, Tocquin P, Lobet G, Detry N, Périlleux C.","title":"Integrating roots into a whole plant network of flowering time genes in Arabidopsis thaliana.","doi":"10.1038\/srep29042","issue":"None","pages":29042,"year":2016}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["7 week"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"growth condition","value":["Short days control","Single 22-hour long day induction of flowering"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root structure"]},{"category":"sampling time point","value":["16 hour","22 hour"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["Short days (control)","Single 22-hour long day (induction of flowering)"]},{"name":"sampling time point","value":["16 hour","22 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1176602,"accession":"P-MTAB-47882"},{"id":1176606,"accession":"P-MTAB-47876"},{"id":1176608,"accession":"P-MTAB-47877"},{"id":1176607,"accession":"P-MTAB-47878"},{"id":1176605,"accession":"P-MTAB-47879"},{"id":1176604,"accession":"P-MTAB-47880"},{"id":1176603,"accession":"P-MTAB-47881"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":1,"isderived":0}]}]}}
