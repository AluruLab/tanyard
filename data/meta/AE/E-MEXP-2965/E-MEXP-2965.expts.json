To obtain clues as to how MYB96 promotes drought tolerance, we carried out microarray assays using the Affymetrix GeneChip. Experiment Design: Total RNAs were isolated from whole plants of two-week-old seedling of mutant plants overexpressing MYB96, MYB96-deficient mutants, and wild-types. Three independent biological replicates were performed for each sample."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Pil Joon Seo","role":"submitter","email":"pjseo1@gmail.com"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21398568,"authors":"Seo PJ, Lee SB, Suh MC, Park MJ, Go YS, Park CM","title":"The MYB96 transcription factor regulates cuticular wax biosynthesis under drought conditions in Arabidopsis","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.111.083485","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["2 week"]},{"category":"biosource type","value":["fresh sample"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["MYB96 overexpression","MYB96-deficient mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"initial time point","value":["germination"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["MYB96 overexpression","MYB96-deficient mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":812754,"accession":"P-MTAB-17742"},{"id":87376,"accession":"P-AFFY-12"},{"id":812755,"accession":"P-MTAB-17741"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
