Experiment Description	"The Arabidopsis MYB96 transcription factor plays a role in abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated drought response. To obtain clues as to how MYB96 promotes drought tolerance, we carried out microarray assays using the Affymetrix GeneChip. Experiment Design: Total RNAs were isolated from whole plants of two-week-old seedling of mutant plants overexpressing MYB96, MYB96-deficient mutants, and wild-types. Three independent biological replicates were performed for each sample."

Protocol Description	"Total RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). The total RNA samples were pretreated with an RNase-free DNase I and cleaned up using the Plant Total RNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen). (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"	"Plants were grown on 1/2 X Murashige and Skoog-agar plates at 22C under long day conditions (16-h light and 8-h dark). White light illumination (120 micro mol photons m-2s-1) was provided by fluorescent FLR40D/A tubes (Osram, Seoul, Korea).(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)"	URL: http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual.affx   <br>Affy_whole_transcript_labelling.pdf   <br>This document describes Affymetrix recommended labeling protocols for use with GeneChip Exon Arrays.
