Protocol Name	P-MTAB-3952	P-MTAB-3953	P-MTAB-3954		
Protocol Description	"Arabidopsis thaliana Zat12::Luciferase plants were grown under constant light (50 µmol.-2.sec-1) on soil mixture (MetroMix 200, SUN GRO) for 3 weeks.<br>(Parameters: start time = 3, time unit = weeks, min temperature = 23, temperature unit = C, media = Soil)"	"Three rosette leaves of each plant were pricked 10 times with the tip of a scalpel. Systemically wounded (distal not injured) leaves (W) were collected 10 minutes following injury, for control (C) unwounded leaves of similar sizes and developmental stages were sampled. <br><br>No more than 3 plants were wounded at a time. "	"Total RNA was extracted from homogenized frozen leaf tissue with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according manufacturer recommendations. Isolated total RNA  was treated with DNaseI (Turbo DNA free, Ambion inc. Austin, Texas) and cleaned on RNeasy Mini columns (Qiagen, ML, USA). <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"
