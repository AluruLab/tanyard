Investigation Title	pad4 vs. pad4 est1b					
Comment[Submitted Name]	pad4 vs. pad4 est1b					
Experiment Description	This experiment was designed to identify transcripts which are changed in plants deficient for evolutionary conserved EST1B gene. A mutation in est1b leads to a constitutive up-regulation of a PAD4-dependent pathogen response pathway. To eliminate secondary effects of the constitutive pathogen response in est1b mutants we will analyze transcriptoms in plants in which lack PAD4.  Keywords: Expression profilling by array 6 samples were used in this experiment

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5 normalized signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = present, marginal, absent calls<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	Labelled using protocol described in Affymetrix manual &quot;3' IVT Express Kit User Manual&quot;	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
