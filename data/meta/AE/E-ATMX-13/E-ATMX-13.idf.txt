Experiment Description	"The transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspensions following treatment with the stress hormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) was monitored over time 16 hours after subcultivation. Three time points were included: 30 minutes, 2 hours and 6 hours after elicitation with 50µm MeJA or DMSO as a control."

Protocol Type	specified_biomaterial_action	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	
Protocol Description	"Samples were vacuum-filtered, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground and stored at -80."	Total RNA was isolated from 50 mg ground cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions.	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	"Raw data were transformed using the robust multiarray analysis algorithm (rma) as implemented in the BioConductor affy package. Default background correction, normalization, and summary expression methods were used. "
