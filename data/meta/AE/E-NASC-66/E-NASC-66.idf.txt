Experiment Description	The aim of this work is to investigate whether A. thaliana senses low temperature by perceiving changes in membrane fluidity. To this end, we have performed an experiment to test whether mutant or transgenic plants with altered membrane lipid composition, regulate their gene expression in the same manner as wild type plants in response to cold.  Previous work has demonstrated that a change in the expression levels of a number of genes is important in acquiring tolerance to low temperatures. Chemicals which rigidify cell membranes in such a way as to mimic the effects of cold have been shown to be able to induce the expression of such genes. However, because of the non-specific nature of such chemical treatments, it has not been possible to demonstrate unequivocally that the changes in gene expression observed were the result of changes in membrane fluidity. All of the mutants used in our experiment,  fab1, fad2-2 and the fad3/fad7/fad8 mutant, have increased lipid saturation levels compared to wild type plants and are thought to have reduced membrane fluidity. The fab1 mutant is also known to be sensitive to chilling. In the fab1 mutant the elongation of 16:0 fatty acids to 18:0 is reduced. The fad2-2 mutant has reduced 18:1 desaturase activity and hence reduced amounts of polyunsaturated phospholipids. The fad3/fad7/fad8 triple mutant is deficient in 18:2 desaturase activity and consequently unable to synthesise trienoic fatty acids. The transgenic line used contained a 35S::FAD3 transgene and in contrast to the mutants tested, should have increased lipid desaturation and increased membrane fluidity. A. thaliana ecotype Col-0 was used as the wild type control for the fab1 and fad2-2 mutants, in addition to the 35S::FAD3 line. The fad3/fad7/fad8 mutant had previously been transformed with the 35S::apoaequorin transgene and a Columbia line expressing apoaequorin under the control of the same promoter, was included to control for the presence of aequorin. Nine day old seedlings grown in petri-dishes on MS were transferred from their growth room (20 oC, 16 h photoperiod, 100 E m-2 s-1) to a growth cabinet (20 oC, 16 h photoperiod,160 m-2 s-1) 24 hours before the experiment began. The next day, one petri-dish of seedlings from each line of plants used was transferred to a cabinet running at 5 oC (16 h photoperiod,160 E m-2 s-1). Control plates remained at 20 oC. Seedlings were harvested after three hours and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Protocol Description													Protocol: Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol 	RNA samples were quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 100 pmol T7-(dT)24 primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3')  was hybridized with the Total RNA ( 8 - 12ug) at 70 Â°C for 10 minutes. First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM ÃÂ-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.
