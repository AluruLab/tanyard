Investigation Title	Expression data from Col-0 and sp1,spx2 under phosphate starvation stress and recovery after resupplying phosphate				
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Col-0 and sp1,spx2 under phosphate starvation stress and recovery after resupplying phosphate				
Experiment Description	We performed a transcriptomic analysis of Pi-starvation and recovery after resupplying Pi in Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0) wild type plants and double mutant spx1,spx2. Results show that SPX1 is a Pi-dependent inhibitor of the transcription factor PHR1, a central regulatory protein in the control of transcriptional responses to Pi starvation. The analysis was performed in wild-type and double spx1,spx2 double mutant plants grown for seven days in complete (+Pi) and Pi-lacking (-Pi) Johnson solid media. Then, plants were transferred to complete medium for 4 hours to analyze the effect of resupplying plants with Pi.

Protocol Description	Analysis was performed using the affylmaGUI R package (Wettenhall et al, 2006). Robust Muti-array Analysis (RMA) algorithm was used for background correction, normalization and expression levels summarization (Irizarry et al., 2003). ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA Log2 Signal intensity	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 3 ug total RNA	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip ATH1 Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Trizol extraction of total RNA and cleanup with RNeasy (Qiagen), according to the manufacturers's instructions.	Each microarray was scanned at 2.5 ﾵm resolution in a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G System (Affymetrix)
