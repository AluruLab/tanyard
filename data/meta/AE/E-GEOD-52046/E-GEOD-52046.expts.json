Results show that SPX1 is a Pi-dependent inhibitor of the transcription factor PHR1, a central regulatory protein in the control of transcriptional responses to Pi starvation. The analysis was performed in wild-type and double spx1,spx2 double mutant plants grown for seven days in complete (+Pi) and Pi-lacking (-Pi) Johnson solid media. Then, plants were transferred to complete medium for 4 hours to analyze the effect of resupplying plants with Pi."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Maria I Puga","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jose M Franco-Zorrilla","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Javier Paz-Ares","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Enrique Rojo","role":"submitter","email":"erojo@cnb.csic.es"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":25271326,"authors":"Puga MI, Mateos I, Charukesi R, Wang Z, Franco-Zorrilla JM, de Lorenzo L, Irigoyen ML, Masiero S, Bustos R, Rodr√≠guez J, Leyva A, Rubio V, Sommer H, Paz-Ares J","title":"SPX1 is a phosphate-dependent inhibitor of Phosphate Starvation Response 1 in Arabidopsis","status":"Published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["7 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["spx1,spx2 double mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedling"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["spx1,spx2 double mutant","wild type"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["complete medium","phosphate-lacking medium","phosphate-lacking medium and resupplied with Pi for 4 h"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1131151,"accession":"P-GSE52046-1"},{"id":1131155,"accession":"P-GSE52046-2"},{"id":1131154,"accession":"P-GSE52046-3"},{"id":1131153,"accession":"P-GSE52046-4"},{"id":1131152,"accession":"P-GSE52046-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0}]}]}}
