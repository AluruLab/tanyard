Protocol Description	Seeds are directly placed on the half MS (Murashige & Skoog) agar plate and raised for 7 days in the growth chamber(16 hour light/8 hour dark). After 7 days has passed, all plants are transplanted from agar medium to soil and raised there for more 13 days in the greenhouse.	All seeds are placed on the half MS (Murashige & Skoog) agar plate in the growth chamber. Average temperature and humidity is 22 degree and 50% each all through the day. Light intensity is around 120 uEinsteins. The light source is controlled with fluorescent lamps (16 hour light/8 hour dark)	All seeds are placed on the half MS (Murashige & Skoog) containing  Hygromycin (final concentration: 15ug/ml) agar plate in the growth chamber. Average temperature and humidity is 22 degree and 50% each all through the day. Light intensity is around 120 uEinsteins. The light source is controlled with fluorescent lamps (16 hour light/8 hour dark) 	Each samples are preserved with grinding ball in 2-ml tube and stored at the deep freezer. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Kit (QIAGEN). <br>1. Grind sample under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder using Mixer Mill MM 301(Retsch).<br> 2. Add 450 µl of Buffer RLT (1% 2-mercaptoethanol) to a maximum of 100 mg of tissue powder. Vortex vigorously. <br>3. Apply lysate to the QIAshredder spin column sitting in a 2-ml collection tube, and centrifuge for 2 min at maximum speed. Transfer flow-through fraction from QIAshredder to a new tube without disturbing the cell-debris pellet in the collection tube.<br> 4. Add 0.5 volumes 100% ethanol to the cleared lysate and mix well by pipetting.<br> 5.&#12288;Apply sample including any precipitate which may have formed,&#12288;onto an RNeasy mini spin column sitting in a 2-ml collection tube. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000 x g.<br> 6. Pipet 700 µl Buffer RW1 onto the RNeasy column, and centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000 x g to wash.<br> 7. Transfer RNeasy column into a new 2-ml collection tube. Pipet 500 µl Buffer RPE onto the RNeasy column, and centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000 x g. <br>8. Add 500 µl Buffer RPE to the RNeasy column, and centrifuge for 2 min at maximum speed to dry the RNeasy membrane. <br>9. Transfer RNeasy column into a new 1.5-ml collection tube, and pipet 30 of RNase-free water directly onto the RNeasy membrane. Centrifuge for 1 min at 8000 x g.	Leaves are collected at the stage when the flower buds are visible in the rosette, but has not yet bolted.@Only the leaves from 5-10 plants (approx.100mg) are harvested and placed into the 2ml tube with grinding ball.
