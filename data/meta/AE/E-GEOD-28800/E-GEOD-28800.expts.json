Initial abiotic stress can interfere with disease resistance signaling. Conversely, initial plant immune signaling may interrupt subsequent ABA signal transduction. However, the processes involved in cross talk between these signaling networks have not been determined. By screening a 9,600 compound chemical library, we identified a small molecule [5-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)Furan-2-yl]-Piperidin-1-ylMethanethione that rapidly down-regulates ABA-dependent gene expression and also inhibits ABA-induced stomatal closure. Transcriptome analyses show that DFPM also stimulates expression of plant defense-related genes. Plate grown 12-day-old seedlings were transferred into 6 well plates with 1:5000 (V\/V) DMSO in water as a control, 30uM DFPM, and 10uM ABA in water as a treatment for 6 hours. DFPM was added 30 min prior to ABA treatment. RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and further purified using RNeasy Plant RNA purification kit (QIAgen, Valencia, CA, USA). Three biological replicates of ATH1 oligonucleotide arrays were hybridized with labeled samples from 1) wild-type Columbia (WT) untreated, 2) WT with 30uM DFPM treatment, 3) WT with 10uM ABA treatment, 4) WT with 30uM DFPM and 10uM ABA treatment. Each biological replicate was prepared by combining 7 independently-treated samples.
