Experiment Description	The loss-of-function mutant of AtLEJ1 had well-developed anther cells and showed an increased accumulation of JA and ET in its flower bud clusters. Conversely, overexpression of AtLEJ1 caused a delay in the development of the floral organs, arrested anther cell development and secondary cell-wall biosynthesis in the endothecium cells, and reduced JA and ET contents in the flower bud clusters, resulting in male-sterility through anther indehiscence. We used microarrays to gain a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional changes induced by AtLEJ1 gene expression, Experiment Overall Design: We performed a full genome microarray analysis (ATH1 Affymetrix chips) with the wild type, 35S:AtLEJ1/5-8 line and atlej1 mutant. Total RNAs were obtained separately from unopened flower buds at stages 1~12, when the anthers are not yet opened, and from open flowers at stages 13~14, when anthesis occurs.

Protocol Type	grow	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	
Protocol Description	unopened flower buds of 5-week-old wild-type grown under LD conditions at 24?.	open flowers of 5-week-old wild-type grown under LD conditions at 24?.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. And then purified with the RNeasy Mini kit.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 microg total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
