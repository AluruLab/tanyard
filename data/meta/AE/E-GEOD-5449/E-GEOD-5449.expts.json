Conversely, overexpression of AtLEJ1 caused a delay in the development of the floral organs, arrested anther cell development and secondary cell-wall biosynthesis in the endothecium cells, and reduced JA and ET contents in the flower bud clusters, resulting in male-sterility through anther indehiscence. We used microarrays to gain a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional changes induced by AtLEJ1 gene expression, Experiment Overall Design: We performed a full genome microarray analysis (ATH1 Affymetrix chips) with the wild type, 35S:AtLEJ1\/5-8 line and atlej1 mutant. Total RNAs were obtained separately from unopened flower buds at stages 1~12, when the anthers are not yet opened, and from open flowers at stages 13~14, when anthesis occurs."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Jung Kwang Wook","role":"submitter","email":"ssamt77@korea.ac.kr"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":61831,"accession":"P-G5449-1"},{"id":61834,"accession":"P-G5449-4"},{"id":61833,"accession":"P-G5449-3"},{"id":61832,"accession":"P-G5449-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
