Experiment Description	Comparison of various inductibles constructions of arabidopsis treated by differents solutions. The aim of this project is to determine the primary and secondary targets of the LEC2 transcrition factor.  The induction by the dexamethasone allows the expression of constructions LEC2:GR or ttg:GR introduced into transforming plants.The dexamethasone induces the expression of the contruct which carries the receptor to the glucocorticoïde (GR.).  The cycloheximide is a inhibitor of the translation and allows, coupled with the dexamethasome, the identification of the primary targets only.  The LEC2_GR25 and LEC2_GR31 constructs are two independents transforming plants of the cDNA-LEC2_GR construct.  Both were used in order to have an idea of the variability of the data transcriptome obtained. The ttg_GR construct is used here as control ; ttg is another transcription factor, thus if induction with the dexamethasone works well,  the targets induced in the two mutants will be different.

Protocol Description	Fifteen-day old plantlets were exposed for 6 h to four different treatments: 1. Water, 2. Dexamethasone (DEX 10-4M), 3. Cycloheximide (Cyclo 10-4M) and 4. Dexamethasone + Cycloheximide (DEX + Cyclo). The first was used as negative control; the second served to identify the genes induced by LEC2; the third is a control to check cycloheximide effects and could separate them from the fourth treatment, which consisted in an induction by dexamethasone together with cycloheximide to get the direct LEC2 targets.  The plantlets were extracted from gelose, crude treated in 12 wells titration plates and then dissected so that material collected consisted only in leaves to avoid the possible reminiscence of seed transcripts in cotyledons. The material was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Then a RNA extraction and finally an RT-PCR were performed prior to chip hybridization.	In vitro culture is performed sowing sterile seeds over the Gambord B5 culture medium (micro- and macro-elements and vitamins at 3.1 g.l-1; Duchef, Haarlem, Neatherlands) containing 1% (p/v) of agarose. To overcome seed dormancy and to synchronize germination, stratification has to be perform, seeds have to stay 72 h at 4Â°C in darkness. Plantlets were grown for  15 days in 10cm petri dishes in a growth cabinet (60% hygrometry, 16 h light at 250 Î¼mol.s-1.m-1, 20Â°C).
