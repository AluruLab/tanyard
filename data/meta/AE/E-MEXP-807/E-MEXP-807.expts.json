The aim of this project is to determine the primary and secondary targets of the LEC2 transcrition factor.  The induction by the dexamethasone allows the expression of constructions LEC2:GR or ttg:GR introduced into transforming plants.The dexamethasone induces the expression of the contruct which carries the receptor to the glucocortico√Øde (GR.).  The cycloheximide is a inhibitor of the translation and allows, coupled with the dexamethasome, the identification of the primary targets only.  The LEC2_GR25 and LEC2_GR31 constructs are two independents transforming plants of the cDNA-LEC2_GR construct.  Both were used in order to have an idea of the variability of the data transcriptome obtained. The ttg_GR construct is used here as control ; ttg is another transcription factor, thus if induction with the dexamethasone works well,  the targets induced in the two mutants will be different."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Sandrine balzergue","role":"submitter","email":"balzerg@evry.inra.fr"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"BioSourceType","value":["frozen_sample"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Wassilewskija"]},{"category":"GeneticModification","value":["  ","gene_knock_in"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["GR::LEC2","GR::tt2","wild type"]},{"category":"Individual","value":["  ","GR","GR25","GR31"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound1","value":["cycloheximide","none","water"]},{"name":"compound2","value":["dexamethasone","none","water"]},{"name":"dose1","value":["     ","4 molar","Unspecified"]},{"name":"dose2","value":["  ","     ","4 molar","Unspecified"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["GR::LEC2","GR::tt2","wild type"]},{"name":"individual","value":["  ","GR","GR25","GR31"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":16,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":502396,"accession":"P-MEXP-29406"},{"id":502394,"accession":"P-MEXP-29461"},{"id":502397,"accession":"P-MEXP-29400"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":502395,"accession":"P-MEXP-29399"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":5,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":5,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":16,"isderived":0}]}]}}
