The time course utilised, encompassed seed maturation, stratification, germination and post-germination and provided a global investigation into the tightly regulated, phasic changes that define seed germination. A previously unidentified transient expression pattern was identified for a group of genes, whereby a significant rise in abundance was observed at the end of stratification and significantly lower expression observed up to 6 hours later. Total RNA extraction was carried out on 80 mg of Arabidopsis seeds at 10 time points during germination in triplicate. The time points selected were: freshly harvested seed (H), seeds following 15 days of ripening (0 h), seeds after; 1 h of stratification (1 h S), 12 h of stratification (12 h S), 48 h of stratification (48 h S), followed by seed collected 1 hour into the light (1 h SL), 6 hours into the light (6 h SL), 12 hours into the light (12 h SL), 24 hours into the light (24 h SL) and 48 hours into the light (48 h SL)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Reena Narsai","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Chris Carrie","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Simon R Law","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Simon Law","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Jim Whelan","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Lin Xiu","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21908688,"authors":"Narsai R, Law SR, Carrie C, Xu L, Whelan J.","title":"In-depth temporal transcriptome profiling reveals a crucial developmental switch with roles for RNA processing and organelle metabolism that are essential for germination in Arabidopsis.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seed"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["freshly harvested seed (H)","seed after 1 h of stratification (1 h S)","seed after 12 h of stratification (12 h S)","seed after 48 h of stratification (48 h S)","seed following 15 days of ripening (0 h)","seed germinating in continuous light 1 h SL","seed germinating in continuous light 12 h SL","seed germinating in continuous light 24 h SL","seed germinating in continuous light 48 h SL","seed germinating in continuous light 6 h SL"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":30,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1136416,"accession":"P-GSE30223-7"},{"id":1136417,"accession":"P-GSE30223-6"},{"id":1136415,"accession":"P-GSE30223-8"},{"id":1136421,"accession":"P-GSE30223-3"},{"id":1136420,"accession":"P-GSE30223-2"},{"id":1136418,"accession":"P-GSE30223-5"},{"id":1136419,"accession":"P-GSE30223-4"},{"id":1136414,"accession":"P-GSE30223-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":30,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":30,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":30,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":30,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":30,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":30,"isderived":0}]}]}}
