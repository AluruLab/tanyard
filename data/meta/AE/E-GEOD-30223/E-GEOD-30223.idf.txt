Investigation Title	Expression data of germinating Arabidopsis seeds							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data of germinating Arabidopsis seeds							
Experiment Description	In depth temporal profiling of transcript changes at 10 time points during germination in Arabidopsis seed was carried out. The time course utilised, encompassed seed maturation, stratification, germination and post-germination and provided a global investigation into the tightly regulated, phasic changes that define seed germination. A previously unidentified transient expression pattern was identified for a group of genes, whereby a significant rise in abundance was observed at the end of stratification and significantly lower expression observed up to 6 hours later. Total RNA extraction was carried out on 80 mg of Arabidopsis seeds at 10 time points during germination in triplicate. The time points selected were: freshly harvested seed (H), seeds following 15 days of ripening (0 h), seeds after; 1 h of stratification (1 h S), 12 h of stratification (12 h S), 48 h of stratification (48 h S), followed by seed collected 1 hour into the light (1 h SL), 6 hours into the light (6 h SL), 12 hours into the light (12 h SL), 24 hours into the light (24 h SL) and 48 hours into the light (48 h SL).

Protocol Name	P-GSE30223-1	P-GSE30223-6	P-GSE30223-3	P-GSE30223-8	P-GSE30223-7	P-GSE30223-2	P-GSE30223-4	P-GSE30223-5
Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = GC RMA signal intensities	Following fragmentation, 12.5 µg of the labelled aRNA was hybridised rotating at 60 rpm, 16 hr at 45 °C on GeneChip ATH1 arrays. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	80 mg of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface steralised and plated on MS media. Stratification was carried out at 4 °C in darkness, light conditions were 100 µE m -2 sec-1 at 22 °C.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. Additionally, GC RMA normalisation was carried out using Partek Genomics Suite.	GeneChips were scanned individually using a GeneChip Scanner 3000	Seed was collected freshly harvested (H), after 14 days of drying (0 h), 1, 12 and 48 h during stratification and 1, 6, 12, 24, 48 h in continuous light.	RNA isolation was carried out using the Ambion Plant RNA isolation aid and RNAqeous RNA isolation kit.	Biotinylated aRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 400 ng total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
