Investigation Title	Transcript profiling of Arabidopsis msh1 mutants							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcript profiling of Arabidopsis msh1 mutants							
Experiment Description	The Arabidopsis msh1 mutant show various growth phenotype. We use microarray analysis to characterize gene expression pattern for two of the phenotypes - variegation and stunted growth. Wild type and msh1 RNAi variegated and stunted tissues were collected for RNA extration and hybridization on Affymetrix.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Bioconductor RMA normalized value	RNA was hybridized to individual Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide ATH1 array using manufacturers instructions	green house grown at 12/12 day and night cycle.	Expression data from Affymetrix genechips were normalized using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method using bioconductorâ€™s affy package in the R language	According to Affymetrix instructions	8 weeks old plants	total RNA was extracted from each plant using TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction procedure followed by purification on RNeasy columns (Qiagen).	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol
