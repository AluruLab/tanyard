However, the determine factors of plant defense patterns are still not clear. Here, we hypothesized that damage patterns of plant attackers play an important role in determining the plant defense patterns. To test this hypothesis, we selected leafminer, which has a special feeding pattern more similar to pathogen damage than chewing insects, as our model insect, and Arabidopsis thaliana as the response plants. The local and systemic responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to leafminer feeding were investigated using the Affymetrix ATH1 genome array. Damaged leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana for local damage analysis and the intact leaves on the same plant for systemic damage analysis were separately frozen by liquid nitrogen. Then, we used an Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis microarray to study the expression changes pattern of Arabidopsis thaliana to pea leafminers damage, both locally (LI) and systemically (SI). We downloaded data from the web database and used hierarchical clustering to explore the relationships of Arabidopsis thaliana expression pattern to different kinds of attackers."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Sufang Zhang","role":"submitter","email":"wavingsnow@ustc.edu"},{"contact":"Le Kang","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23231622,"authors":"Sufang Zhang, Zhen Zhang and Le Kang","title":"Transcriptome response analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana to leafminer (Liriomyza huidobrensis)"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["4 week"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"growth condition","value":["locally damaged by leafminer","systemically damaged by leafminer","undamaged"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["control","locally damaged by leafminer","systemically damaged by leafminer"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1126913,"accession":"P-GSE38281-6"},{"id":1126912,"accession":"P-GSE38281-7"},{"id":1126917,"accession":"P-GSE38281-2"},{"id":1126915,"accession":"P-GSE38281-3"},{"id":1126916,"accession":"P-GSE38281-4"},{"id":1126914,"accession":"P-GSE38281-5"},{"id":1126911,"accession":"P-GSE38281-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
