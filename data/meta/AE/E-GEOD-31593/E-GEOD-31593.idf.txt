Investigation Title	Genes regulated by GRF1 and GRF3 in Arabidopsis roots						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Genes regulated by GRF1 and GRF3 in Arabidopsis roots
Experiment Description	Arabidopsis Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips were used to compare the mRNA profiles of root tissues of the grf1/grf2/grf3 triple mutant and transgenic plants overexpressing miR396-resistant variants of GRF1 (P35S:rGRF1) or GRF3 (P35S:rGRF3) with those of the corresponding wild-type (Col-0 or WS).   Wild-type (Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Col-0 and Ws), the triple mutant grf1/grf2/grf3, and transgenic plants overexpressing rGRF1 or rGRF3 were grown in vertical culture dishes on modified Knopâ€™s medium for 2 weeks and then root tissues were collected for RNA extraction.   ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Tarek Hewezi.  The equivalent experiment is AT109 at PLEXdb.] genotype: Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Col-0(3-replications);  genotype: Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes WS(3-replications);  genotype: Triple mutant grf1/grf2/grf3(3-replications);  genotype: P35S:rGRF1 overexpression(3-replications);  genotype: P35S:rGRF3 overexpression(3-replications)

Protocol Description	ID_REF = Affymetrix probe set id<br>VALUE = MAS5-calculated Signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), marginal (M), or no call (NC)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 'detection p-value', p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Affy- Array Scanning	Affymetrix GeneChip Hyb	Hot Phenol/Guanidine Thiocyanate and RNeasy Clean up	Growth Description: Growth chamber: Plants were grown at 23°C under 16-h-light/8-h-dark conditions.	Affymetrix one-cycle target labeling	The MAS5.0 Normalization is performed using the justMAS function in the simpleaffy package of Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.org). The target value is 500 for all cases. The code was developed using R2.4.1, Bioconductor 1.9, and simpleaffy 2.8.0. The CDF files were downloaded from the Bioconductor website at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/AffymetrixChip.html. The normalization scripts are available from the PLEXdb team by request.
