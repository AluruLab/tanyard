Investigation Title	Expression data from Arabidopsis mature siliques							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis mature siliques							
Experiment Description	"Analysis of the transcriptomes of nearly ripe siliques (18-19 DAP) of the rdo2-1, rdo3 and hub1-2 (rdo4) mutants in comparison with wild-type Ler, using Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. The experiment includes rdo2, rdo3, and rdo4 as well the Ler genotypes with three biological replicates for each. Therefore in total there are 12 arrays"

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = GC-RMA signal intensity<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	"After fragmentation, 12.5 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45 degrees Celsius on GeneChip ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained with Fluidics Script FS450_004 in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450."	"Plants were grown on soil containing a mixture of substrate and vermiculite (3:1) in Elbanton growth cabinets (Elbanton BV, Kerkdriel, the Netherlands) under long day conditions (16 h light at 22oC and 8 h dark at 16oC)."	"Processing and statistical analysis of the microarray data were done in Expressionist Pro v5.1 (Genedata AG, Basel, Switzerland). We used the GC-RMA algorithm for background correction, normalization and probe summarization. Various quality metrics were examined to exclude quality problems."	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.	Siliques were harvested from the plants at 18-19 days after pollination and immediately frozen until RNA extraction	"Extraction of RNA was performed using RNAqueous columns (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA)."	"Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the standard Ambion protocol from 1 ug total RNA (MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced Kit, 2008, Ambion)."
