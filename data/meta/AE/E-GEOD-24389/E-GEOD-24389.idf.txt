Investigation Title	Analysis of the Aloe vera transcriptome using the Affymetrix ATH1 GenChip								
Comment[Submitted Name]	Analysis of the Aloe vera transcriptome using the Affymetrix ATH1 GenChip								
Experiment Description	The Aloe vera transcriptome was analysed by hybridising triplicate samples of root and leaf tissue to the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 array. In total, 7 samples were hybridised to the array. Samples consisted of 1 genomic DNA, and triplicate samples of leaf and root RNA.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA pre-normalised using Aloe_250.CDF and normalised to the median of the gene signal across all samples.	Array scanning was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Affymetrix) using an Affymetrix 3000 7G scanner.	Samples were hybridised at the NASC Microarray Core Facility according to manufacturer's instructions. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy plant mini kit according to the manufactures' instructions.	Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen Rneasy plant mini kit according to the manufactures' instructions.	A mature Aloe plant obtained from a local garden centre, was grown in the laboratory at room temperature.	250ng of total RNA was labelled using the Affymetrix 3' IVT express kit as per manufactures' instructions	500ng of genomic DNA was labelled using the Invitrogen DNA labelling kit as per manufactures' instructions	The RNA data was analysed using the Genspring GX 11 Software (Agilent technologies) using the RMA probe summarisation algorithm, using a CDF file produced from the Aloe gDNA hybridisation result with a hybridisation threshold of 250. Each gene signal was then normalised to the median of the gene signal across all samples.
