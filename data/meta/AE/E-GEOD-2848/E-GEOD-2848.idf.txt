Experiment Description	The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of ARF6 and ARF8 to flower gene expression. Flowers from arf6 arf8 plants undergo a developmental arrest at approximately stage 12, just prior to flower opening. Flowers from wild-type, arf6/arf6 ARF8/arf8, and arf6 arf8 plants were separated into stage 1-10 flowers, stage 11+12 flowers, and stage 13-14 flowers to define the developmental stages at which ARF6 and ARF8 are required for gene expression.
