Experiment Description	"Our interest lies in how plants respond to bacterial pathogens. Over the past three years we have identified and documented reproducible, landmark biochemical and molecular events following the challenge of Arabidopsis with the phytopathogenic enterobacteria P. syringae. Significantly, our studies revealed 60% of cDNA-AFLP differentials not present on the 8,200 feature GeneChips and 20% absent from public EST databases (de Torres in press). We now seek to exploit this background using carefully defined time-points to analyse global changes in the Arabidopsis transcriptome using challenges selected to define gene targets implicated in (i) expression of basal immunity (ii) the establishment of successful parasitism (resistance) by a virulent pathogen (host). The results will provide a rationale for future functional assays of the identified pathways using transgenic knockouts and mutant analyses. Additionally, data will provide underpinning support for comparative proteomics of the defense response currently in progress with GARNet support using the same experimental parameters (BBSRC 32/P14635).  We propose the following treatments: (i) Mock vs. DC3000hrpA @ 60 min: 60 minutes is subsequent to host immediate-early stress responses and will  catalogue the innate responses induced by pathogen associated molecular patterns. The hrpA lesion will ensure no type III effectors influence transcriptional responses. Gene products induced at this time are predicted to potentiate latter host responses (2 treatments X 3 biological replicates = 6 chips).  (ii) Mock vs. DC3000 vs. DC3000hrpA vs. DC3000::avrRpm1 @ 4 hours: A key time point previously defined where no macroscopic symptoms are visible but significant differences exist between compatible and incompatible interactions at the molecular and physiological levels. These treatments will serve to define the earliest genes induced by the complement of DC3000 type III effector and will specifically define genes/pathways suppressed by virulence factors in addition to those implicated in orchestration of the hypersensitive cell death. We will also include an incompatible interaction on a transgenic line expressing an RPM1 interacting protein, which fails to mount an HR but exhibits hyper-resistance. We predict this challenge will separate the resistance response (pathogen restriction) from that associated with hypersensitive cell death (5 treatments X 3 biological replicates = 15 chips). (iii) Mock vs. DC3000 vs. DC3000hrpA @ 14 hours: At 10 h before phenotypes are apparent in the DC3000 background, Type III effector delivery is well advanced and impact on host transcription maximal (3 treatments X 3 biological replicates = 9 chips). Experiment Overall Design: Number of plants pooled:4 leaves/plant; 18 plants/time point"

First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM Ã-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.   ; Protocol Type = labeling; Performers: John,Y,Okyere, Janet,,Higgins"	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
