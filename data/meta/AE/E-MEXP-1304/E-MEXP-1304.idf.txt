Experiment Description	In most organisms biological processes are partitioned, or phased to specific times over the day through interactions between external cycles of temperature (thermocycles) and light (photocycles), and the endogenous circadian clock. This orchestration of biological activities is achieved in part through an underlying transcriptional network. To understand how thermocycles, photocycles and the circadian clock interact to control time of day specific transcript abundance in Arabidopsis thaliana, we conducted four diurnal and three circadian two-day time courses using Affymetrix GeneChips (ATH1). All time courses were carried out with seven-day-old seedlings grown on agar plates under thermocycles (HC, hot/cold) and/or photocycles (LD, light/dark), or continuous conditions (LL, continuous light; DD, continuous dark, HH, continuous hot). Whole seedlings (50-100), including roots, stems and leaves were collected every four hours and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The four time courses interrogating the interaction between thermocycles, photocycles and the circadian clock were carried out as two four-day time courses.  Four-day time courses were divided into two days under diurnal conditions, and two days under circadian conditions of continuous light and temperature. Thermocycles of 12 hours at 22C (hot) and 12 hours at 12C (cold) were used in this study. The two time courses interrogating photoperiod were conducted under short days (8 hrs light and 16 hrs dark) or long days (16 hrs light and 8 hrs dark) under constant temperature. In addition, the photoperiod time courses were in the Landsberg erecta (ler) accession, in contrast to the other time courses that are in the Columbia (col) background. The final time course interrogated circadian rhythmicity in seedlings grown completely in the dark (etiolated). Dark grown seedlings were synchronized with thermocycles, and plants were sampled under the circadian conditions of continuous dark and temperature.

Protocol Description	Seedlings (50-100) from individual plates were collected every four hours.	50-100 Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were vapor sterilized overnight. At 8 A.M., seeds were imbibed on plates containing ½ LS media with 0.8% agar at pH 5.8. Seeds were stratified for 3 days at 4°C and at 8 A.M. on the fourth day they were released into short day conditions of 8 hours light (100 µmol/m2s) and 16 hours dark at 22°C. After seven days of growth, plants were harvested starting at the dark to light transition of the eighth day.	50-100 Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were vapor sterilized overnight. At 8 A.M., seeds were imbibed on plates containing ½ LS media with 0.8% agar at pH 5.8. Seeds were stratified for 3 days at 4°C and at 8 A.M. on the fourth day they were released into photocycles (LD:12 hours light [100 µmol/m2s] and 12 hours dark) and thermocycles (HC: 12 hours at 22°C and 12 hrs at 12°C). The photocycles and thermocycles were overlapping so that temperature increased when the lights came on and temperature decreased when the lights went off. On the ninth day, plants were released into circadian conditions of continuous light (100 µmol/m2s) and temperature (22°C). Plants were harvested starting at the dark to light transition of the ninth day.	50-100 Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were vapor sterilized overnight.

At 8 A.M., seeds were imbibed on plates containing ½ LS media with 0.8% agar at pH 5.8 plus 3% sucrose. Seeds were stratified for 3 days at 4°C and at 8 A.M. on the fourth day they were released into long day conditions of 16 hours light (100 µmol/m2s) and 8 hours dark at 22°C. After seven days of growth, plants were harvested starting at the dark to light transition of the eighth day.	100-500 Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were vapor sterilized overnight. At 8 A.M., seeds were imbibed on plates containing ½ LS media with 0.8% agar at pH 5.8 plus 3% sucrose. Seeds were stratified for 3 days at 4°C and at 8 A.M. on the fourth day they were released into continuous dark and thermocycles (HC: 12 hours at 22°C and 12 hrs at 12°C). On the seventh day, plants were released into circadian conditions of temperature (22°C) and maintained in continuous dark. Plants were harvested starting at subjective dawn on the seventh day. Seedlings never experienced the light during this time course.	Collected tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen in 2 ml eppindorph tubes with three steel ball bearings and stored at -80°C. Frozen tissue was disrupted on a Retsch shaker under liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using QIAGEN RNAeasy kits with on column DNAase treatment and resuspended in 35 µl RNAase-free H2O.
