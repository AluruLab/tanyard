Investigation Title	Early effects of cdkf;1 RNAPII CTD Serine-7 kinase mutation on regulation of transcription in 7 days old Arabidopsis seedlings								
Comment[Submitted Name]	Early effects of cdkf;1 RNAPII CTD Serine-7 kinase mutation on regulation of transcription in 7 days old Arabidopsis seedlings								
Experiment Description	"Serine phosphorylation of conserved Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 repeats of RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (RNAPII CTD) plays a central role in the regulation of transcription and co-transcriptional RNA processing. Maintenance of CTD phosphoserine-7 mark in Arabidopsis requires the CDKF;1 kinase, which mediates in vivo activation of downstream-acting CDKD CTD kinase family. Knockout mutations of CDKF;1 lead to over 50% reduction of RNAPII CTD Ser-7 phosphorylation as early as 7 days after germination in seedlings. The transcript profiling experiment aimed at determining how early changes in CTD Ser-7 phosphorylation affect global regulation of transcription. We used Affymetrix ATH1-121501 Genome Array to compare global transcript levels in wild type and cdkf;1-2 mutant seedlings 7 days after germination. Wild type and cdkf;1-2 mutant Arabidopsis (Col-0) seedlings were grown in solid MSAR medium (Koncz, C., Martini, N., Szabados, L., Hrouda, M., Bachmair, A., and Schell, J. (1994). Specialized vectors for gene tagging and expression studies. In: Plant Molecular Biology Manual, Gelvin,S., and Schilperoort, B. (eds.), Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht-Boston-London, B2, 1-22.) containing ½ concentration of macro elements and 0.5% sucrose in Petri-dishes at 22°C, 120 mol/m2s light intensity and 8h light/16h dark period. Seedling were collected at 4h after the start of the light period in liquid nitrogen for RNA preparation."

The data was analyzed with Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) version 1.4 using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method.	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.	Whole seedling were collected at 4h after the start of the light period using a photoperiod of 8h light and 16h dark with 120 mol/m2s light intensity at 22°C  for RNA preparation.	Whole seedling were collected at 4h after the start of the light period using a photoperiod of 8h light and 16h dark with 120 mol/m2s light intensity at 22°C for RNA preparation.	Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy Mini kit supplied with RNase-Free DNase set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	"Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the standard Ambion protocol from 1 μg total RNA (MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced Kit, 2008, Ambion)."
