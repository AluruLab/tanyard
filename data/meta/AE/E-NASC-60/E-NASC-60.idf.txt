Experiment Description	Background:  The UK horticultural and agricultural industries routinely apply large amounts of inorganic fertiliser to maintain crop yield and quality, since chemical assays of soil nutrients are unreliable. Excessive fertiliser applications are costly and can lead to unnecessary pollution. A possible solution is to use sensor (GM or non-GM) technologies that exploit the changes in plant gene expression under incipient nutrient deficiency. Aim:  The aim of this project is to use mutants with reduced leaf phosphate contents to identify genes upregulated in response to phosphate stress. Preliminary gene expression analysis has identified several phosphate responsive genes to be upregulated in the pho1 mutant. However, further replicates of the experiment are required to confirm these changes. Methods:  Arabidopsis mutant pho1 (N8507) and its parent ecotype Columbia 2 (N907) will be grown on MS agar under identical conditions. RNA will be extracted from the rosette leaves of both parent and mutant and the same growth stage. By comparing the expression profiles, we will be able to differentiate between genes that are upregulated in leaves experiencing phosphate stress. Previously, two GeneChips have been used (mutant and parent) to provide preliminary data. A further two biological replicates are now required to confirm these results. Promoters and transcripts of these genes will underpin the development of novel sensor technologies, and knowledge of the gene expression profiles will improve our understanding of the physiology of plant mineral nutrition.

Protocol Description	Title: Growth protocol. Description: Seeds were first washed in 70 % (v/v) ethanol/water, rinsed in distilled water and surface sterilised using 50 % (v/v) domestic bleach/water. Seeds were then rinsed three times in sterile distilled water and imbibed for 3-5 days at 4 degrees C to break dormancy. Seeds were grown in un-vented, polycarbonate culture boxes on 75 ml of 0.8 % (w/v) agar containing 1 % (w/v) sucrose and a basal salt mix (Murashige and Skoog, 1962). Illumination was provided by a bank of 100W 84 cool fluorescent tubes (Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands) giving an photon flux density between 400 and 700 nm of 50-80 µmol photons m-2 s-1 at plant height. Once plant reached the desired growth stage, rosette leaves were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNA extracted.	Protocol: Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol 	RNA samples were quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 100 pmol T7-(dT)24 primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3')  was hybridized with the Total RNA ( 8 - 12ug) at 70ÃÂ°C for 10 minutes.  First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM ÃÂ-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.
