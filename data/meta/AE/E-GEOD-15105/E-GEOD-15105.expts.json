After performing cutin and wax analyses on these Arabidopsis thaliana mutants, which did not coincide with the putative enzyme functions, we hypothesised that these mutations trigger a complex response which may be visible at the transcriptional level. This analysis revealed that major changes in gene regulation are taking place in bodyguard (bdg), lacerata (lcr) and fiddlehead (fdh) mutants, massively affecting genes associated with lipid, cell wall and intracellular homeostasis but also with pathogen resistance. Experiment Overall Design: Plants carrying a stable allele of the bodyguard (bdg), lacerata (lcr) and fiddlehead (fdh) mutations, respectively, were grown on soil in parallel to wild type Columbia plants and under controlled growth conditions. Trays were periodically shifted to avoid any position effect and, to increase representativeness of the samples, each sample contains leaf tissue from 15 plants."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Derry Voisin","role":"submitter","email":"voisin@mpiz-koeln.mpg.de"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19876373,"authors":"Voisin D, Nawrath C, Kurdyukov S, Franke RB, Reina-Pinto JJ, Efremova N, Will I, Schreiber L, Yephremov A.","title":"Dissection of the complex phenotype in cuticular mutants of Arabidopsis reveals a role of SERRATE as a mediator.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"genotype","value":["bdg-2 mutant","fdh-3940 mutant","lcr-3P77 mutant","wild type genotype"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["rosette leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["bdg-2 mutant","fdh-3940 mutant","lcr-3P77 mutant","wild type genotype"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1125109,"accession":"P-G15105-4"},{"id":1125111,"accession":"P-G15105-5"},{"id":1125112,"accession":"P-G15105-1"},{"id":1125110,"accession":"P-G15105-3"},{"id":1125113,"accession":"P-G15105-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
