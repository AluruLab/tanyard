Protocol Description	9-day old kanamycin resistant seedlings were harvested into liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C before RNA extraction.	Seeds were surface-sterilized and plated on growth medium (1X MS plus vitamins, 1% sucrose, 0.8% agar, 2.5mM MES pH 5.7, 75 ug/ml kanamycin). The seeds were stratified for 2 days at 4C in the dark before germination in a growth room (16h light, 8h dark, 20C).	Total RNA extracted with TRIzol reagent (Gibco BRL) according to the manufacturer's instructions and purified with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).	First strand cDNA synthesis was performed according to the Affymetrix Manual II, using 5 ug of total RNA. Second strand cDNA synthesis was performed with minor modifications to the Affymetrix Manual II. cDNA termini were not blunt ended and the reaction was not terminated using EDTA. Instead double-stranded cDNA products were immediately purified following the "Phase Lock Gel Cleanup of Double-Stranded cDNA" protocol (Affymetrix Manual II). cDNA was resuspended in 22 ul of RNAse free water.<br> <br> cRNA preparation was performed with minor modifications to the Affymetrix Manual II.  Briefly, 11 ul of cDNA was used as a template to produce biotinylated cRNA using half the recommended volumes of the ENZO BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit. Labelled cRNAs were purified following the "Qiagen RNeasy Cleanup and Quantification of Biotin-Labeled cRNA" protocol (Affymetrix Manual II). cRNA quality was assessed by on Agilent RNA6000nano LabChips® (Agilent Technology 2100 Bioanalyzer Version A.01.20 SI211). cRNA quantity was assessed by running 1 ul of each cRNA sample on a NanoDrop® ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies).	20 µg of cRNA was fragmented and hybridisation cocktails were set-up according to the Affymetrix Manual II. Hybridization O/N at 45C and 60 rpm (Hybridization Oven 640), washing and staining (GeneChip® Fluidics Station 450, using the EukGEws2_450 Antibody amplification protocol) and scanning (GeneArray® 3000) was carried out according to the Affymetrix Manual II.	Scanning (GeneArray® 3000) was carried out according to the Affymetrix Manual II.	Data transformed by RMA method.
