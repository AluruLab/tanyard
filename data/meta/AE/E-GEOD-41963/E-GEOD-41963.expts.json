To analyze the function of a CC-type rice GRX gene, OsGRX8, we overexpressed it into Arabidopsis constitutively. The physiological analyses revealed that overexpression of GRX gene enhanced abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants as compared to wild-type. We used microarrays to study the global effect of overexpression of OsGRX8 in Arabidopsis under control and various treatments. Wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on MS medium for 14-days in a culture room with a daily photoperiodic cycle of 16h light and 8h dark. Seedlings were incubated in water (control) or 100 µM solution of indole-3-acetic acid (auxin, IAA), 200 mM sodium chloride (salt, NaCl) and 25 µM solution of methyl viologen (MV)for 3h. The 500 ng of total RNA sample isolated from each tissue sample was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix protocol. Two biological replicates for each sample (control, IAA, NaCl and MV) of wild-type and GRX overexpression line were used for microarray analysis."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Mukesh Jain","role":"submitter","email":"mjain@nipgr.ac.in"},{"contact":"Jain Mukesh","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Priya Pushp","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Sharma Raghvendra","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["GRX-overexpression","Wild-type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["Seedlings"]},{"category":"Stage","value":["14-day-old"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND","value":["control","IAA","MV","NaCl"]},{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["GRX-overexpression","Wild-type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":16,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":857931,"accession":"P-GSE41963-5"},{"id":857930,"accession":"P-GSE41963-6"},{"id":857934,"accession":"P-GSE41963-3"},{"id":857933,"accession":"P-GSE41963-4"},{"id":857928,"accession":"P-GSE41963-1"},{"id":857932,"accession":"P-GSE41963-2"},{"id":857929,"accession":"P-GSE41963-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0}]}]}}
