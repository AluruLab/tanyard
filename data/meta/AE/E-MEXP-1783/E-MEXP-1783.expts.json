Thus, TROL might represent a missing thylakoid membrane linker for the assembly of a ternary complex between FNR, ferredoxin and NADP+. Such a complex is necessary for maintaining photosynthetic redox poise and balancing between several alternative electron-transport pathways of oxygenic photosynthesis. TROL inactivation modulates the expression of 638 nuclear genes, revealing a novel retrograde signaling pathway. Chloroplasts are the major source of NADPH which is exported to the cytosol where it participates in various redox-dependent processes. TROL is most likely the first element in a metabolic signaling pathway which influences the expression of a large set of stress related genes. Among them are O-methyltransferases and anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase which are highly upregulated. Microarray analysis was performed in order to identify metabolic networks and pathways regulated by the deficient protein TROL. Comparing ATH1 Affymetrix data results, 317 genes were down-regulated and 321 genes were classified as up-regulated, amongst which mostly affected enzymes were catalyses, oxigenases, monooxygenases and reductases involved in the process of photosynthesis."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Ana Tomasic","role":"submitter","email":"atomasic@irb.hr"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"genetic modification","value":["gene knock out","none"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["AT4G01050 knock-out","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["rosette leaf"]},{"category":"provider","value":["  ","The T-DNA insertion line in the Columbia background for At4g01050 (SAIL_27_B04) was obtained from NASC seed stock."]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["AT4G01050 knock-out","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":776792,"accession":"P-MTAB-1572"},{"id":776791,"accession":"P-MTAB-1573"},{"id":79337,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4[]"},{"id":77,"accession":"P-AFFY-2"},{"id":776789,"accession":"P-MTAB-1570"},{"id":776790,"accession":"P-MTAB-1571"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
