Protocol Name	P-MTAB-1866	P-MTAB-1867	P-MTAB-1868
Protocol Description	WT versus ccr1-1 showing all raw data after MAS5 and GCRMA Probe level analysis and filtering for 1.5 Fold Change	"Seeds were sowed to soil in yates seedling trays and placed at 4 degree celcius in the dark for 2-3 days.  After vernalization plants were grown in soil under 16 hr of light per day at an intensity of 100 to 150 umolﾕm2ﾕsec1 at 21 degrees celcius as a standard condition.  Pooled leaf tissues were harvested after 10 days and used for microarray analysis.<br><br><br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, min temperature = 21, max temperature = 22, temperature unit = C, media = Soil)"	"total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Protocol (QIAGEN, Clifton Hill, Australia). The quality of the RNA was verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and spectrophotometric analysis to determine concentration and the A260 to A280 ratio.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"
