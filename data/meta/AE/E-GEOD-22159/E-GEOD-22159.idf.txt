Experiment Description	Chromatin remodeling factors of the Imitation Switch (ISWI) family play important roles in epigenetic regulations of gene expression in yeast and animals, whereas their function in plants remains elusive. Here we report characterization of the Arabidopsis ISWI genes CHR11 and CHR17. Double mutant chr11 chr17 displayed a dramatically reduced plant size with early flowering. In addition, epidermis of the double mutant leaves showed cell characteristics seen only in floral organs. These phenotypes resemble, at least partially, those of the Polycomb mutants curly leaf (clf) and like heterochromatin protein1 (lhp1). Microarray analysis revealed that a number of targets of the Polycomb pathway were derepressed in chr11 chr17 leaves. Furthermore, triple mutants combining chr11 chr17 with clf-29 or lhp1-6 both greatly enhanced clf-29 and lhp1-6 phenotypes, respectively. All these results strongly suggest that the ISWI family genes in Arabidopsis may function in gene silencing via the Polycomb pathway Leaves from 15-day-old seedlings of wild-type Col-0 and chr11-1 chr17-1 were used for RNA preparation.In the experiment data,A refers to Col-0, and B refers to chr11-1 chr17-1.

Protocol Description	no treatment	Extract and purify the total RNA by the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit.Reverse Transcription to Synthesize First-Strand cDNA is primed with  T7 oligo(dT) primer to synthesize cDNA containing a T7 promoter sequence.Second-Strand cDNA Synthesis converts the single-stranded cDNA into  a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) template for transcription. The reaction employs DNA polymerase and RNase H to simultaneously degrade the RNA  and synthesize second strand cDNA.	16 h light, 8 h dark, 21 degrees C	In Vitro Transcription to Synthesize Biotin-Modified aRNA with IVT Labeling Master Mix generates multiple copies of biotin-modified aRNA from  the double-stranded cDNA templates; this is the amplification step.aRNA Purification removes unincorporated NTPs, salts, enzymes, and  inorganic phosphate to improve the stability of the biotin-modified aRNA.	Fragmentation of the labeled aRNA prepares the target for hybridization to GeneChip(r) 3'Â™ expression arrays with GeneChip(r) hybridization oven 640.	Wash and stain the arrays with GeneChip(r) fluidics station 450, Scan the arrays with the GeneArray scanner 3000 by the GeneChip(r) Operating  Software (GCOS) or Command Console(r) (AGCC) Software.	RMA data were obtained by using Partek GS 6.4.	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA signal intensity
