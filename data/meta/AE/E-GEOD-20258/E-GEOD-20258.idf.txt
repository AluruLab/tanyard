Experiment Description	Aims: To compare the transcriptional profiles of an AtHAP5 (AtNF-YC, AtCBF-C) triple mutant vs. a Constans mutant.  Background Information on Mutants: AtHAP5 triple mutant created by cross between the following SALK TDNA inserts: SALK_034838, SALK_058903, SALK_032163; these correspond to At1G54830, At1G08970, At5G63470, respectively. co-SAIL TDNA insertion SAIL_24_H04 corresponds to AT5G15840.  Tissue: Above-ground whole plants grown for 10 days, under 16 hr light 8 hrs dark at constant 22C. Tissue collected 14 hrs after lights on. RT-PCR analysis on test RNA confirmed FT levels reduced in mutants lines compared to wild-type. 9 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	Plant were grown for 10 days under 16hr light, 8 hr dark cycles (110 uE m-2 s-1) at constant 22C on a 50/50 mix of Farfard and Metromix. Bottom watered with 0.5g/L Peter's 20-20-20 fertilizer. Soil treated with Marathon pesticide at 40g/36quarts of soil. All above ground plant tissue was collected on day 10, 14 hours after lights on.	Labelled using protocol described in manual "Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual", One-Cycle target labelling	Biotin Labelled cRNA using "Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit", according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0-calculated signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call
