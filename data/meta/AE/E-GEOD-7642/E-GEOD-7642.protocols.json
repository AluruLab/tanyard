Seeds were stratified at 4ËšC for 2 days before being planted on standard media.  Standard media is 1X concentration Murashige and Skoog salt mixture (Caisson laboratories), 0.5g\/L MES, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH.  Salt media is standard media with varying amounts of NaCl added.  Nylon mesh was placed on top of the solidified media and seeds were evenly placed on the mesh in a single row at a density of ~2\/cm for all experiments.","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0},{"id":68758,"accession":"P-G7642-2","name":"P-G7642-2","text":"Seedlings were grown for 4-5 days before transfer to standard media supplemented with 140 mM NaCl.  Transfers were staggered such that all roots were harvested within 3 hours of each other on the sixth day of growth.  Roots were cut with a razor blade 0.5 mm below the root\/hypocotyl junction and collected into RNA extraction buffer.  Approximately 15 roots were collected per replicate, with two biological replicates being performed per time point.  Samples were briefly sonicated to disrupt the tissue.","type":"specified_biomaterial_action","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0},{"id":68755,"accession":"P-G7642-3","name":"P-G7642-3","text":"Fragmented cRNA probes were prepared using the two-cycle amplification protocol by Affymetrix.","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0},{"id":68757,"accession":"P-G7642-4","name":"P-G7642-4","text":"Approximately 15 roots were collected per replicate.
