Experiment Description	Global expression of the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulator SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) in a 35S:STM-GR transgenic line was induced for 3 hours with dexamethasone (DEX) compared to mock-induced (DMSO) control. Additionally,to identify direct targets, plants were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) together with DEX, compared to CHX treatment alone.

Protocol Description	Plants were sown on GM medium (MS salts + 1% sucrose)and grown for 9 days under continuous white light at 22 degrees celsius. Chemical treatments were performed 3 hours prior to sample harvesting.	RNA extracted with Tripure and LiCL precipitation. Dissolved in water.	For each sample, shoot tissue from 9 plants was collected and ground in liquid N2.	Standard Affymetrix array scanning and MAS5 extraction	Chemical treatments were performed 3 hours before harvesting. DEX and CHX were added at a concentration of 60 micromolar. Equivalent volume of DMSO was used in mock treated control.	As per Affymetrix instructions	As per Affymetrix instructions	Standard affymetrix protocols.	Standard affymetrix protocols.	Shoot tissue was separated from root tissue with forceps.
