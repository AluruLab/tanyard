Comment[Submitted Name]	Micro-array analysis of WT and AtISWI in callus formation						
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis leaf explants cultured in CIM from chr11-1, chr17-1 double mutant at 0 and 8 days after culture						
Experiment Description	Plant regeneration could be achieved via formation of a pluripotent cell mass termed callus, nature of which is a group of fast-dividing root primordium cells. However, mechanisms that strictly control the stem cell fate transition in regeneration of callus remain elusive. Here we show that the Arabidopsis ISWI type chromatin remodelers specifically promote the second-step cell fate transition from root founder cells to root primordium cells in the leaf-to-callus transition. Leaf explants cultured in CIM from Col-0 or chr11-1 chr17-1 at time 0 and 8 days after culture (8 DAC) were used for RNA preparation. Microarray was performed using the AffymetrixGeneChip system. Three independent experiments were performed.

Protocol Description	RMA data were obtained by using Partek GS 6.4. ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA signal	In Vitro Transcription to Synthesize Biotin-Modified aRNA with IVT Labeling Master Mix generates multiple copies of biotin-modified aRNA from the double-stranded cDNA templates; this is the amplification step.aRNA Purification removes unincorporated NTPs, salts, enzymes, and inorganic phosphate to improve the stability of the biotin-modified aRNA.	Fragmentation of the labeled aRNA prepares the target for hybridization to GeneChip 3â€™ expression arrays with GeneChip hybridization oven 640.	Leaf explants were cultured on callus-inducing medium (CIM).	16 h light, 8 h dark, 22 degreeC for seedlings; 24 h dark, 22 degreeC for callus	Extract and purify the total RNA by the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit.Reverse Transcription to Synthesize First-Strand cDNA is primed with T7 oligo(dT) primer to synthesize cDNA containing a T7 promoter sequence.Second-Strand cDNA Synthesis converts the single-stranded cDNA into a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) template for transcription. The reaction employs DNA polymerase and RNase H to simultaneously degrade the RNA and synthesize second strand cDNA.	Wash and stain the arrays with GeneChip fluidics station 450, Scan the arrays with the GeneArray scanner 3000 by the GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) or Command Console (AGCC) Software.
