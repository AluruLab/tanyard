However, mechanisms that strictly control the stem cell fate transition in regeneration of callus remain elusive. Here we show that the Arabidopsis ISWI type chromatin remodelers specifically promote the second-step cell fate transition from root founder cells to root primordium cells in the leaf-to-callus transition. Leaf explants cultured in CIM from Col-0 or chr11-1 chr17-1 at time 0 and 8 days after culture (8 DAC) were used for RNA preparation. Microarray was performed using the AffymetrixGeneChip system. Three independent experiments were performed."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Shujing Liu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Lin XU","role":"submitter","email":"xulin01@sibs.ac.cn"},{"contact":"Lin Xu","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genetic modification","value":["knock out","none"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["chr11-1, chr17-1 double mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"growth condition","value":["leaf explants cultured on callus-inducing medium"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["chr11-1, chr17-1 double mutant","wild type"]},{"name":"time","value":["0 day","8 day"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1167703,"accession":"P-GSE57145-7"},{"id":1167704,"accession":"P-GSE57145-6"},{"id":1167705,"accession":"P-GSE57145-5"},{"id":1167706,"accession":"P-GSE57145-4"},{"id":1167707,"accession":"P-GSE57145-3"},{"id":1167708,"accession":"P-GSE57145-2"},{"id":1167702,"accession":"P-GSE57145-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
