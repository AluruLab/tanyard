Investigation Title	Expression data from Arabidopsis wild-type, KO-nudx6, KO-nudx7, and double KO-nudx6/7 plants						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis wild-type, KO-nudx6, KO-nudx7, and double KO-nudx6/7 plants
Experiment Description	Arabidopsis Nudix hydrolases, AtNUDX6 and 7, exhibit pyrophosphohydrolase activities toward NADH and contribute to the modulation of various defense responses, such as the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PAR) reaction and salicylic acid (SA)-induced Nonexpresser of Pathogenesis-Related genes 1 (NPR1)-dependent defense pathway, against biotic and abiotic stresses. To identify genes (NRGs) whose expression levels positively and negatively correlated with NADH levels, a transcriptome analysis using KO-nudx6, KO-nudx7, and double KO-nudx6/7 plants, in which intracellular NADH levels increased in a step-wise manner. Arabidopsis wild-type, KO-nudx6, KO-nudx7, and double KO-nudx6/7 plants were grown on MS medium in a growth chamber kept at 23Â°C during 16 h of light (100 Âµmol/m2/s) and at 22Â°C during 8 h of darkness. Two-week-old cotyledons were collected as samples for microarray analysis.

Protocol Description	Raw data were processed using Affymetrix Gene Chip Operating Software (GCOS; Version 1.4.0.036). ID_REF =  VALUE = Signal ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M) DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Total RNA samples were reverse-transcribed, yielding double-strand cDNA, which was transcribed in vitro in the presence of biotin-labeled nucleotides with an IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA), and purified.	Labeled cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip arrays for 16 h at 45Â°C according to Affymetrix protocols.	At 2 weeks of age, cotyledons were collected as samples.	Arabidopsis wild-type, KO-nudx6, KO-nudx7, and double KO-nudx6/7 plants were grown on MS medium in a growth chamber kept at 23Â°C during 16 h of light (100 Âµmol/m2/s) and at 22Â°C during 8 h of darkness.	Total RNA was semi-automatically purified from various organs of Arabidopsis plants using a QuickGene RNA cultured cell Kit and QuickGene-Mini80 (FUJIFILM corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The quality and purity of the RNA were confirmed for microarray analysis with an Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare UK Ltd, Amersham Place, England).	Arrays were washed on an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 and measured for fluorescence intensity with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.
