To identify genes (NRGs) whose expression levels positively and negatively correlated with NADH levels, a transcriptome analysis using KO-nudx6, KO-nudx7, and double KO-nudx6\/7 plants, in which intracellular NADH levels increased in a step-wise manner. Arabidopsis wild-type, KO-nudx6, KO-nudx7, and double KO-nudx6\/7 plants were grown on MS medium in a growth chamber kept at 23°C during 16 h of light (100 µmol\/m2\/s) and at 22°C during 8 h of darkness.
