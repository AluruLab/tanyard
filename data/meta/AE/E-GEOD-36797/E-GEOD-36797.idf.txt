Comment[Submitted Name]	Oleic acid-dependent modulation of Nitric Oxide Associated 1 protein levels regulate nitric oxide mediate signaling in plant defense.							
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type and mutant genotypes ssi2, ssi2 act1 and ssi2 sid2.							
Experiment Description	Oleic acid-dependent modulation of Nitric Oxide Associated 1 protein levels regulate nitric oxide- mediate signaling in plant defense. Nitric Oxide, Oleic acid, Salicylic acid, Arabidopsis, Defense Wild-type Col-0, mutant genotypes ssi2, ssi2 act1 and ssi2 sid2 with three  biological replicates were analyzed (one array each)

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS 5.0 signal<br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	standard Affymetrix procedures	Columbia ecotype, 3-4 week old plants, grown in MTPS 144 conviron walk in Chamber at 22 degree C, 65% RH and 14 hr photoperiod	standard Affymetrix procedures Total RNA was isolated from four-week-old plants using TRIZOL method. The experiment was carried out in triplicate and a separate group of plants was used for each set. RNA was processed and hybridized to the Affymetric Arabidopsis ATH1 genome array GeneChip following the manufacturers instructions. All probe sets on the Genechips were assigned hybridization signal above background using Affymetrix Expression Console Software v1.0.	standard Affymetrix procedures	Columbia ecotype, 3-4 week old plants, grown in MTPS 144 conviron walk in Chamber at 22 degree C, 65% RH and 14 hr photoperiod. Leaves were harvested from four week plants.	Trizol Method	standard Affymetrix procedures
