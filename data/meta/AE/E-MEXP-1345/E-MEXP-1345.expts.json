We used publicly available data to select probesets that never detect endogenous transcripts, and used PCR and IVT to generate synthetic mRNAs corresponding to them. After quality control and testing, these control transcripts were spiked into total RNA samples from plants before and after 24 h of cold treatment. Due to changes in the proportion of mRNA, these data reveal intensity-dependent bias in expression estimates based on standard all-gene normalizations. When not accounted for, this leads to false classification of the differential expression for thousands of genes."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Matt A Hannah","role":"submitter","email":"hannah@mpimp-golm.mpg.de"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":18375597,"authors":"Bieniawska, Zuzanna; Espinoza, Carmen; Schlereth, Armin; Sulpice, Ronan; Hincha, Dirk K; Hannah, Matthew A","title":"Disruption of the Arabidopsis circadian clock is responsible for extensive variation in the cold-responsive transcriptome","doi":"10.1104\/pp.108.11805","status":"journal_article"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["45 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia-0 G1"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf tip"]},{"category":"specimen with known storage state","value":["frozen specimen"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["after cold treatment at 4 degrees Celsius","before cold treatment"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":57,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4_450"},{"id":77,"accession":"P-AFFY-2"},{"id":235758,"accession":"  "},{"id":1055789,"accession":"P-MEXP-114539"},{"id":80632,"accession":"P-MEXP-114017"},{"id":80634,"accession":"P-MEXP-114016"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":80631,"accession":"P-MEXP-114540"},{"id":80630,"accession":"P-MEXP-114656"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
