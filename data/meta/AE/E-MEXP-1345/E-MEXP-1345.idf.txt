Experiment Description	To address the neglected possibility for global mRNA changes in microarray experiments we developed a simple method to generate external controls for Affymetrix microarrays to allow these platforms to measure absolute mRNA expression at the global level. We used publicly available data to select probesets that never detect endogenous transcripts, and used PCR and IVT to generate synthetic mRNAs corresponding to them. After quality control and testing, these control transcripts were spiked into total RNA samples from plants before and after 24 h of cold treatment. Due to changes in the proportion of mRNA, these data reveal intensity-dependent bias in expression estimates based on standard all-gene normalizations. When not accounted for, this leads to false classification of the differential expression for thousands of genes.

Protocol Description	Nonacclimated control plants were transferred to a 4°C growth chamber with a 16 h photoperiod at 90 µmol m-2 s-1 for a specified period of time as indicated be the hours in the sample name. Treatments started at different times of the day as indicated by the zeitgeber time (ZT) in the sample name. 	Columbia (Col-0-G1) was initially soil grown for 4 weeks in short-days (8 h) before transfer to long-days (16 h) at a day/night air temperature of 20 °C/18 °C and 150 µmol m-2 s-1 light. Experiments were started when the rosette was mature (40-45 days after germination) and completed before the inflorescence reached 0.5-2cm. Experiments [treatments] were started at different times of the day as indicated by the hours after dawn [zeitgeber time (ZT)] in the sample name. The time of day of harvest can be calculated by adding the treatment duration to this ZT.	Leaf discs (10 mm) were taken from the tips of mature leaves, one from each individual plant. Total RNA was extracted from 3 independent discs and the same amount of Total RNA from each sample was pooled.	As manufacturers instructions	gcrma (package version 2.8.1) implemented in bioconductor (version 2.0) for R version 2.5.1. Default settings.
