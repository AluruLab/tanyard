Protocol Name	P-MTAB-35245	P-MTAB-35246	P-MTAB-35247
Protocol Description	Seedlings were submerged in 1/2MS liquid media for 16 hr and treated water (mock) or 1 uM RALF peptide for 30 min.	QIAGEN RNeasy Plant Kit was used to extract total RNA. (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Arabidopsis (Col Wildtype) seedlings were grown on vertically positioned plates at 22C for five days. (Parameters: start time = 5, time unit = days, temperature unit = C, media = 1/2MS media)
Protocol Type	treatment protocol	nucleic acid extraction protocol	growth protocol
