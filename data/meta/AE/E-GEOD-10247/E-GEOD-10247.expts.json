Transcripts expressed in the phloem tissue (parenchyma cell, companion cell, sieve element) were excised by laser microdissection pressure catapulting (LMPC). These were compared with transcripts isolated from leaf phloem exudates by EDTA-chelation technique. Optimization of sample harvest resulted in RNA of high quality from both sources. Modifications of the RNA amplification procedure obtained RNA of sufficient yield and quality for microarray experiments. Microarrays (Affymetrix, ATH1) hybridized with RNA derived from phloem tissue by LMPC or phloem sap allowed us to differentiate between phloem located and mobile transcript species. The datasets provide a search criterion for phloem-based signals and will facilitate reverse genetic studies and forward genetic screens for phloem and long distance RNA signaling mutants. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis plants were cultivated under short day conditions (8 h light) until flowering. Phloem tissue was isolated by Lasermicrodissection and Pressure Catapulting (LMPC) and phloem exudate by EDTA-chelation technique. In both experiments poly-A-RNA was extracted and amplified before hybridization of microarrays (Affymetrix, ATH1). For both experiments three LMPC-derived phloem tissue (LMPC-derived phloem_1-3) and three phloem exudate samples (Phloem exudate_1-3) were analysed. Precise protocols of plant growth, sample harvest, RNA extraction and amplification are provided in Deeken et al., 2008."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Rosalia Deeken","role":"submitter","email":"deeken@botanik.uni-wuerzburg.de"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":18485061,"authors":"Deeken R, Ache P, Kajahn I, Klinkenberg J, Bringmann G, Hedrich R.","title":"Identification of Arabidopsis thaliana phloem RNAs provides a search criterion for phloem-based transcripts hidden in complex datasets of microarray experiments.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["inflorescence stalk phloem tissue","leaf phloem exudate"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"organism part","value":["phloem exudate","phloem tissue"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":1132673,"accession":"P-G10247-2"},{"id":1132670,"accession":"P-G10247-3"},{"id":1132674,"accession":"P-G10247-1"},{"id":1132676,"accession":"P-G10247-6"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":1132672,"accession":"P-G10247-7"},{"id":1132671,"accession":"P-G10247-4"},{"id":1132675,"accession":"P-G10247-5"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
