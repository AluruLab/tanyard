Experiment Description	Analysis of ethylene mutant (eto1-4) genome expression profile altered by ethylene antagonists. Results uncovered a significant number of genes that were co-regulated by the ethylene antagonists which may contribution on phenotype difference between WT and eto1-4. WT (Col-0) or ethylene mutant (eto1-4) were etiolated growth 3-day on 0.5x MS medium as control. Ethylene mutant (eto1-4) etiolated growth 3-day on 0.5x MS medium containing 10 Î¼M different ethylene antagoinsts were used as experimental set. Whole seedling was used for total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. cDNA labeling, array hybridization, and scanning followed by standard Affymetrix expression array protocol. Two independent sets of microarray analyses were performed in this assay.
