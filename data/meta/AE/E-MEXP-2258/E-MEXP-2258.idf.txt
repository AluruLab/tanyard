Experiment Description	The aim of this experiment is to test the ability of the ortholog of Arabidopsis LFY gene from flowering and non flowering species to complement an Arabidopsis LFY mutant. <br>Plants expressing, in a homozygous lfy12 background, the open reading frame of LFY orthologs under the control of Arabidopsis LFY promoter were synchronously induced to flower by growing plants in short days for 30 days then shifting them to Long Day for an additional 8 days. Shoot apices were dissected at either d0 or d8 in long days. Two biological replicates were performed. The following genotypes were used: <br>Col - wild type arabidopsis; reference strain<br>LFY (lfy12; LFY::AthLFY) - Arabidopsis<br>UNI (lfy12; LFY::UNI) - Pisum<br>ALF (lfy12; LFY::ALF)  - Petunia <br>WelNDLY (lfy12; LFY::WelNDLY)  - Welwitschia mirabilis<br>CrLFY1 (lfy12; LFY::CrLFY1) - Ceratopteris richardii<br>CrLFY2 (lfy12; LFY::CrLFY2) - Ceratopteris richardii<br>lfy-2; weak lfy allele<br>lfy-9; intermediate leafy allele<br>lfy-12; strong leafy allele.

Protocol Description	Plants were grown on soil for 30 days under short day conditions (8 hr light/16 hr darkness) at 23C and 65% relative humidity.<br>(Parameters: start time = 30, time unit = days, min temperature = 23, temperature unit = C)	Plants were grown on soil for 30d under short day conditions (8h light/ 16h darkness) at 23C and 65% relative humidity. Shoot apical meristem were dissected.	Plants were grown on soil for 30 days under short day conditions (8 hr light/16 hr darkness) at 23C and 65% relative humidity. Plants where then shifted to long day conditions (16 hr light/8 hr darkness) at 23C and 65% relative humidity for 8 days. Inflorescence meristem were then dissected.
