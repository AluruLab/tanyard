Investigation Title	The rsa1-1 mutation affects global gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana with or without salt stress						
Comment[Submitted Name]	The rsa1-1 mutation affects global gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana with or without salt stress						
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis rsa1-1 mutants under salt stress						
Experiment Description	Salt stress is one of the most severe environmental conditions which cause huge losses in crop production worldwide. We identified a novel calcium-binding protein and used the Affymetrix whole-genome arrays to define downstream targets of this important protein. We used the microarrays to reveal the effect of rsa1-1 mutation on global gene expression in response to 120 mM Nacl for 0 or 24 h. A set of genes differentially expressed in rsa1-1 with or without salt stress are identified. Six-day-old seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (Columbia gl1 expressing RD29A::LUC transgene) and rsa1-1 mutant seedlings subjected to salt stress with 120 mM NaCl for 0, or 24 h were used for total RNA extraction and hybridizations with Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips. There are three biological replicate per genotype.

Protocol Description	The datasets were subjected to the Robust Multiarray Averaging (RMA) normalization method. The normalized data were further analyzed and p-values were generated by the affymGUI component of Bioconductor in statistics environment R with the default parameters.Genes were selected by the RankProd (non-paramteric method based on the estimated percentage of false discoveries (p value < 0.05)) method. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 RMA signal	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA was hybridized for 16 h at 45 C on Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	Six-day-old wild type and rsa1-1 mutant plants were subjected to salt stress with 120 mM NaCl for 0 and 24 h.	Arabidopsis seedlings on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium agar plates (1x MS salts, 2% sucrose, 1.2% agar, pH 5.7) were grown under cool, white light (~120 Î¼mol m-2 s-1) at 21 C with a 16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod.	Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.
