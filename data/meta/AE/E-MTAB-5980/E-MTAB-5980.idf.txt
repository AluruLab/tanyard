Protocol Term Accession Number	EFO_0003815	EFO_0003813	EFO_0002944	EFO_0003789
Protocol Description	The microarray data were analyzed using the GenPlex	Labeling of samples was carried out according to the manufacturerâ€™s standard protocol from Affymetrix.	Total RNAs were isolated from Arabidopsis stems using Nucleospin RNA plant extraction kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL) according to the instructions of the manufacture.	All Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in pots on a soil mixture (3:2:1 mixture of peat moss-enriched soil:vermiculite:perlite). After germination on MS medium, the plants were transferred to a controlled growth room under long-day conditions (16h/8h, light/dark) at 22 to 23 C and 50% relative humidity.
