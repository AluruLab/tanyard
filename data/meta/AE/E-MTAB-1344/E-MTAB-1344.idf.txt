Protocol Type	grow	specified_biomaterial_action	nucleic_acid_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	labeling
Protocol Description	Plants were grown in soil culture (1:1:1 mixture of Fruhsdorfer Erde Klocke P, perlite and vermiculite) for 4.5 weeks under the following conditions: 10ﾠh of light, 100ﾠumol quanta m-2 s-1, 23ﾠC and 14ﾠh darkness at 18ﾠC; 55ﾠ% relative humidity. For low light acclimation 3 week old normal light grown plants were transferred to low light (8ﾠumol quanta m-2 s-1) and grown for further 10 d. See Oelze et al. 2012 for further details.	For the treatments, whole plants were illuminated with high light (800ﾠumol quanta m-2 s-1) for 6 hours or left in low light as control (Oelze et al. 2012).	Total RNA was extracted by QUIAGEN Plant RNA Kit following the manufactures instructions. Purity was checked by Nanodrop (ND-1000, Peqlab, Germany) and gel electrophoresis	RMA-normalization	The samples were biotin-labeled according to the GeneChip 3ﾒ IVT Express Kit User Manual by Affymetrix
