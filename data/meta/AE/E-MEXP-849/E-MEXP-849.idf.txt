Protocol Description	Seeds were placed on 3 layers of filter paper soaked in sterile water.	Plant grows at 22C under long day condition. 38-day(ga1-3), 28-day(wide type), and 22-day(penta) flower buds were collected for RNA extraction.	Seeds were grounded in liquid nitrogen and RNA samples were extracted by RNAqueos Kit(Ambion).	RNA were extracted follow tri reagent protocol and further purified by using Qiagen RNAeasy mini kit.	no pooling	No pooling.	extracted by RNAqueous from Ambion	RNA were extracted using tri reagent and further purified by qiagen mini RNAeasy kit.	follow Affymetrix standard protocol	Affymetrix standard protocol	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol.
