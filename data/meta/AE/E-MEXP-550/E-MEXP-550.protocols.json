The oligonucleotide used for priming was 5’-ggccagtgaattgtaatacgactcactatagggaggcgg-(t)24-3’ (Genset Oligo, France) as recommended by Affymetrix. Double-stranded cDNA was purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and the aqueous phase was removed by centrifugation through Phase-lock Gel (Eppendorf). In vitro transcription was performed on 1 µg of cDNA using the Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labelling kit (Enzo Diagnostics, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The cRNA was purified using RNAeasy clean-up columns (Qiagen). To improve the recovery from the columns, the elution water was spun into the matrix at 27 g and then left to stand for one minute prior to the standard 8000 g centrifugation recommended by Qiagen. The cRNA was fragmented by heating in fragmentation buffer (40mM Tris-acetate pH8.1, 100mM KOAc, 30mM MgOAc) as recommended by Affymetrix.","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0,"parameter":["Amount of nucleic acid labeled","Amplification","Label used"]}]}}
