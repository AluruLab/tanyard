Comment[Submitted Name]	Polysome profiling in CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1-overexpressing (CCA1-ox) Arabidopsis thaliana over a 24-hour diurnal cycle
Experiment Description	Circadian control of gene expression has been established in plants at the transcriptional level, but relatively little is known about circadian control of translation.  We used polysome profiling to characterize regulation of transcription and translation over a 24-hour diurnal cycle in Arabidopsis, both in wild type and in plants with a disrupted clock due to constitutive overexpression of the CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 gene (CCA1-ox, AGI AT2G46830). 10 day-old wild type and CCA1-ox (described in Cell. 1998 Jun 26;93(7):1207-17) Arabidopsis seedlings were harvested at 6am (Zeitgeber time ZT0), 12pm (ZT6), 6pm (ZT12), and 12am (ZT18), with 3 replicates for each time and genotype.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed using R version 3.1.  Normalization was performed using the gcrma function from the gcrma package from Bioconductor (version 2.36), and absolute calls (columns labeled ABS_CALL)  were generated using the mas5calls function from the affy package (version 1.42.3), all with default settings.  AGI annotations (column labeled AGI) were matched with Affymetrix probe IDs using the ath1121501.db package from Bioconductor (version 2.14).    Translation state (TL) was calculated as (2*small polysomal + 7*large polysomal)/(non-polysomal + small polysomal + large polysomal) after back-transforming the log2 values. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 GC-RMA signal ABS_CALL = 	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from total and polysome-fractionated RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix) after priming cDNA synthesis with oligo(dT).	cRNA was hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on the GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by a wash with biotinylated antibody goat IgG and another staining with streptavidin-phycoerythrin.	Plants were grown on agar plates with full strength Murashige and Skoog salts, pH 5.7, 1% sucrose, in a 16-hour light/8-hour dark cycle (lights on at 6am) for 10 days.	RNA extraction, polysome fractionation, and microarray hybridization were performed as described previously (Genome Biol. 2007;8(4):R60)	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip 7G high-resolution scanner.
