Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from inflorescence (unopened flower buds) of Arabidopsis thaliana - comparison between Ler and ask1 mutant
Experiment Description	ARABIDOPSIS SKP1-LIKE1 (ASK1) protein is involved in regulating flower development. We have compared ask1 mutant floral transcriptome with wild-type Ler to identify the role of ASK1-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases in regulating flower transcriptome. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from Arabidopsis thaliana Ler and ask1 mutant flower buds. We identified 42 genes and 74 genes that are down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively. Totally 5 samples were analyzed: 3 samples of ask1 and 2 samples of Ler. The average values were compared between ask1 and Ler.

Protocol Description	Microarray datasets (.CEL files) were normalized by R package RMA and exported as Excel files ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 GC-RMA signal	Samples were enzymatically fragmented and biotinylated using the WT Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix)	Prepare hybridization cocktail using the GeneChip Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (#702232) and hybridize arrays according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions in the Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640.	Plants were grown in soil for about 5-6 weeks until unopened flower buds were collected.	Ler and ask1 flower bud total RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin® RNA Plant kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL).	GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G
