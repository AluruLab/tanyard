We have compared ask1 mutant floral transcriptome with wild-type Ler to identify the role of ASK1-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases in regulating flower transcriptome. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from Arabidopsis thaliana Ler and ask1 mutant flower buds. We identified 42 genes and 74 genes that are down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively. Totally 5 samples were analyzed: 3 samples of ask1 and 2 samples of Ler. The average values were compared between ask1 and Ler."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Dihong Lu","role":"submitter","email":"ludh666888@hotmail.com"},{"contact":"Dihong Lu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Weimin Ni","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"genotype","value":["ask1-\/-","Ler"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["unopened flower buds"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["ask1-\/-","Ler"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":5,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":982045,"accession":"P-GSE42841-3"},{"id":982043,"accession":"P-GSE42841-4"},{"id":982040,"accession":"P-GSE42841-1"},{"id":982044,"accession":"P-GSE42841-2"},{"id":982042,"accession":"P-GSE42841-5"},{"id":982041,"accession":"P-GSE42841-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":5,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":5,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":5,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":5,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":5,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":5,"isderived":0}]}]}}
