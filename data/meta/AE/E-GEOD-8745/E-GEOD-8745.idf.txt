Experiment Description	The purpose of this experiment was to identify genes responding differently to a 24 h low red to far red ratio (R:FR) treatment in plants grown at 16 and 22 degrees Experiment Overall Design: Microarrays were used as a gene discovery tool to identify genes showing differential regulation by low R:FR at 2 growth temperatures. Plants subject to a 24 h low R:FR light treatment were compared with control plants maintained in high R:FR. This experiment was carried out at two growth temperatures, 16oC and 22oC.

Protocol Description	4-day-old seedlings were treated with low R:FR (0.1) for 24 h before harvesting	None	Seedlings were grown for 4 days on soil in 100Â&#956;molm-2s-1 of white light (R:FR 4.4) at 22 degrees before transfer to low R:FR (R:FR 0.1) for 24 h.	Seedlings were grown for 4 days on soil in 100Â&#956;molm-2s-1 of white light (R:FR 4.4) at 16 degrees before transfer to low R:FR (R:FR 0.1) for 24 h.	Seedlings were grown for 5 days on soil in 100Â&#956;molm-2s-1 of white light (R:FR 4.4) at 22 degrees.	Seedlings were grown for 5 days on soil in 100Â&#956;molm-2s-1 of white light (R:FR 4.4) at 16 degrees.	RNA was extracted from cotyledon (and a small amount of hypocotyl) tissue using RNeasy kits (Qiagen) followed by extraction with acid phenol chloroform and precipitation with ethanol to a concentration > 3mg/ml.	Labelling was carried out by the John Innes Centre Genome Laboratory (http://jicgenomelab.co.uk) according to Affymetrix standard protocols (http://www.affymetrix.com).
