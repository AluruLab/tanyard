Plants subject to a 24 h low R:FR light treatment were compared with control plants maintained in high R:FR. This experiment was carried out at two growth temperatures, 16oC and 22oC."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Keara Franklin","role":"submitter","email":"kaf5@le.ac.uk"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":17965713,"authors":"Keara A Franklin, Garry C Whitelam","title":"Light-quality regulation of freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana.","doi":"10.1038\/ng.2007.3","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["5 days"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Landsberg erecta"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["phyA","phyA-2"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["phyA","phyA-2"]},{"name":"GROWTH CONDITION","value":["high red:far-red ratio light","low red:far-red ratio light"]},{"name":"TEMPERATURE","value":["16 degree_C","22 degree_C"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":420821,"accession":"P-G8745-1"},{"id":420819,"accession":"P-G8745-2"},{"id":420815,"accession":"P-G8745-3"},{"id":420816,"accession":"P-G8745-4"},{"id":420820,"accession":"P-G8745-5"},{"id":420818,"accession":"P-G8745-6"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":420817,"accession":"P-G8745-7"},{"id":420822,"accession":"P-G8745-8"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
