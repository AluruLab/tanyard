Protocol Description	After a 48-hour treatment at 4°C, A. thaliana Landsberg erecta (Ler-0) and fls2-17 seeds were grown for 12 days on plates containing 1x MS medium (Duchefa), 1% sucrose and 1% agar under continuous light conditions of 60 µE m-2 sec-1 (Biolux lamps) at 22°C. Seedlings were then transferred to liquid MS medium (two seedlings per 500 µl of medium in wells of 24-well-plates). Two days after transfer the medium was supplied with flg22 peptide to a final concentration of 10 µM. Plantlets were collected 30 min after treatment, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.

Seedlings were then transferred to liquid MS medium (two seedlings per 500 µl of medium in wells of 24-well-plates). Two days after transfer the medium was supplied with flg22 peptide to a final concentration of 10 µM. Plantlets were collected 30 min after treatment, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.	Total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies) and purified on RNeasy Miniprep columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' instructions.	10 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript Choice system for cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies) according to the protocol recommended by Affymetrix. The oligonucleotide used for priming was 5?-ggccagtgaattgtaatacgactcactatagggaggcgg-(t)24-3? (Genset Oligo). Double-stranded cDNA was cleaned by phenol:chloroform extraction and the aqueous phase removed by centrifugation through Phase-lock Gel (Eppendorf). In vitro transcription was performed on 1 µg of cDNA using the Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labelling kit (Enzo Diagnostics). The cRNA was cleaned using RNAeasy clean-up columns (Qiagen). The cRNA was fragmented by heating in 40 mM Tris-acetate pH 8.1, 100 mM KOAc, 30 mM MgOAc.	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
