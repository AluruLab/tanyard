Arabidopsis were well-watered until after just bolting (after 24 days growth with the main stem about 1 cm high) when moderate drought treatment was started by withholding water (defined as day 0 for moderate drought treatment). The relative soil moisture content decreased rapidly and, after about 48 hours the relative soil moisture content was near 50% of the soil water-holding capacity (first moderate drough treated sample M3 were collected at day 3 (72 h after withholding water)). The soil water condition was maintained by daily watering until almost all the fruits were mature and ready to harvest (about 50 days). For well-watered (control) plants, 90% of the soil water-holding capacity was maintained until tissue harvest or after seed maturation (pots were weighed and watered twice per day). Unopened floral bud samples were collected at day 0, 3, 4, 5, 10."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Hong Ma","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Xuan Ma","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Zhao SU","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Zhao Su","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["at day 24 after seed germination","at day 27 after seed germination","at day 28 after seed germination","at day 29 after seed germination","at day 34 after seed germination"]},{"category":"cultivar","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["Unopen flower buds"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"AGE","value":["at day 24 after seed germination","at day 27 after seed germination","at day 28 after seed germination","at day 29 after seed germination","at day 34 after seed germination"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":10,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1027116,"accession":"P-GSE55431-7"},{"id":1027117,"accession":"P-GSE55431-6"},{"id":1027121,"accession":"P-GSE55431-2"},{"id":1027120,"accession":"P-GSE55431-3"},{"id":1027119,"accession":"P-GSE55431-4"},{"id":1027118,"accession":"P-GSE55431-5"},{"id":1027115,"accession":"P-GSE55431-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":10,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":10,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":10,"isderived":0}]}]}}
