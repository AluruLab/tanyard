Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis flowers under moderate drought stress
Experiment Description	We also used microarray analysis to examine transcriptomic changes under moderate drought, identifying thousends of genes that potentially mediate moderate drought responses in the flower, including genes encoding transcription factors that likely play crucial regulatory roles. Arabidopsis were well-watered until after just bolting (after 24 days growth with the main stem about 1 cm high) when moderate drought treatment was started by withholding water (defined as day 0 for moderate drought treatment). The relative soil moisture content decreased rapidly and, after about 48 hours the relative soil moisture content was near 50% of the soil water-holding capacity (first moderate drough treated sample M3 were collected at day 3 (72 h after withholding water)). The soil water condition was maintained by daily watering until almost all the fruits were mature and ready to harvest (about 50 days). For well-watered (control) plants, 90% of the soil water-holding capacity was maintained until tissue harvest or after seed maturation (pots were weighed and watered twice per day). Unopened floral bud samples were collected at day 0, 3, 4, 5, 10.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed by using robust multi-array averaging (RMA, including background subtraction, summarization by median polish and quantile normalization) with the R/Bioconductor package affy. and then converted to logarithm base 2. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2-RMA	Standard Affymetrix protocol.	Standard Affymetrix protocol.	Arabidopsis were well-watered until after just bolting (after 24 days growth with the main stem about 1 cm high) when moderate drought treatment was started by withholding water (defined as day 0 for moderate drought treatment). The relative soil moisture content decreased rapidly and, after about 48 hours the relative soil moisture content was near 50 % of the soil water capacity (collecting M3 sample at day 3(72 h after withholding water). The soil water condition was maintained by daily watering until almost all the fruits were mature and ready to harvest (about 50 days). For well-watered (control) plants, 90% of the soil water capacity was maintained until tissue harvest or after seed maturation (pots were weighed and watered twice per day). Unopened floral buds samples were collected at day 0, 3, 4, 5, 10.	Seeds were directly sown into pots containing 100g soil mixture of Metro-Mix 360 soil (Sun Gro Horticulture Canada Ltd) and Turface profile greens grade (Profile Products LLC) in 3:2 ratio by volume, with a maximum water-holding capacity of 100g (defined as 100% soil moisture). Seeds were stratified in a cold room for 2 d at 4 ℃ in the dark. After stratification, the pots with seeds were transferred into a Conviron growth chamber (Conviron Inc), which was set at our normal conditions (22 ℃, 16h day/8h night photoperied, ~300 μmol m-2 s-1 photon flux, 60% humidity) until just after flowering (bolting) when some of the plants were subjected to moderate drought stress.	Total RNA was isolated from unopened flower buds using RNeasy columns following instructions from the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).	Standard Affymetrix protocol.
