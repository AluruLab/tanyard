Investigation Title	Effect of the explosive compound TNT on wild type seedlings							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Effect of the explosive compound TNT on wild type seedlings							
Experiment Description	"The aim of this experiment was to identify the genes involved in the detoxification of the toxic pollutant and explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). Fourteen-day-old, liquid culture grown, Arabidopsis seedlings, ecotype Col0 (NASC stock code N1093), were dosed with 60 uM TNT dissolved in 60 ul dimethyl formamide (DMF) solvent, or 60 ul DMF only. After six hours, RNA was extracted and used for the microarray analysis. Further details and characterisation of glucosyltransferases identified using this method are presented in citation below. 6 samples were used in this experiment"
