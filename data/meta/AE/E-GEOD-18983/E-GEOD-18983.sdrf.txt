GSM469816 1	"Seeds were stratified for three days at 4 C in the dark on agar plates containing half strength Murashige and Skoog medium with 20 mM sucrose. Seeds were sterilized using Conclor disinfectant tablets. One tablet was dissolved in 14 ml of dH20 with 2-3 drops of 1% Tween 20, then 5 ml of this solution added to 45 ml of 95% ethanol. Any precipitate was allowed to settle, then 1 ml of the ethanol/ Conchlor solution was added to each Eppendorf tube of seeds. The tubes were shaken for five minutes then the Conchlor solution removed and the seeds washed six times with 95% ethanol and the seeds air-dried.
