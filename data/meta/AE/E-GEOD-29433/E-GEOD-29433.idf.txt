Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptomic analysis of the myb3r1 myb3r4 double mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana											
Experiment Description	R1R2R3-Myb proteins represent an evolutionarily conserved class of Myb family proteins important for cell cycle regulation and differentiation in eukaryotic cells. In plants, this class of Myb proteins are believed to play important roles in cell cycle regulation through transcriptional regulation of G2/M phase-specific genes by binding to common cis-elements, called MSA elements. In Arabidopsis thaliana, MYB3R1 and MYB3R4 act as transcriptional activators and positively regulate cytokinesis by activating transcription of KNOLLE, which encodes a cytokinesis-specific syntaxin. Here, we show that the double mutation myb3r1 myb3r4 causes pleiotropic developmental defects, some of which are due to deficiency of KNOLLE whereas other are not, suggesting multiple target genes are involved. Consistently, microarray analysis of the double mutant revealed altered expression of many genes, among which G2/M-specific genes showed significant overrepresentation of the MSA motif and a strong tendency to be down-regulated by the double mutation. Our results demonstrate, on a genome-wide level, the importance of the MYB3R-MSA pathway for regulating G2/M-specific transcription. In addition, MYB3R1 and MYB3R4 may have diverse roles during plant development by regulating G2/M-specific genes with various functions, as well as genes possibly unrelated to the cell cycle. Comparison between the myb3r1 myb3r4 double mutant and wild type in three paired replicates.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Log2 value of MAS5.0 signal intensity divided by median value of all non-control probe sets<br>ABS_CALL = 	Following fragmentation, 15 micro g of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hrs at 45 Celsius degrees on the GeneChip. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Seedlings were grown in half-strength MS agar medium with 2% sucrose in continuous light at 22 Celsius degrees.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. All signals were divided by the median value of all probe sets.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.	None.	Total RNA was extracted using the Plant RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 micro g of total RNA.
