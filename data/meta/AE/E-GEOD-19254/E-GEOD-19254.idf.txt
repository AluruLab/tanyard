Investigation Title	Cold acclimation in the sfr3-1 mutant						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Cold acclimation in the sfr3-1 mutant						
Experiment Description	The sfr3-1 mutation causes freezing-sensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana. The mutated gene has been identified by positional cloning and is currently being characterised.  The mutant appears normal when grown in the warm (no phenotype has been identified associated with such growth). However, following cold acclimation and subsequent freezing mutant plants are severely damaged whilst wild type plants are not. This suggests that sfr3 is deficient in the cold acclimation process. Micro-array analysis will enable the identification of any transcriptional changes during the cold acclimation process. This information will then be used, together with information obtained by gene characterisation, in order to more fully understand the nature of the sfr3 mutation. 8 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	Seeds were sown in trays containing compost comprised of 6 parts Levington's M3, 6 parts John Innes no. 3 and 1 part perlite. The trays were placed at 4 degrees centigrade for 48 hours prior to transfer to the growth room. Growth conditions were short day (8hrs light, 16 hrs dark), 20 degrees centigrade at 70% humidity. Light intensity was 100 micro Einsteins.	Labelled using protocol described in manual &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual&quot;, One-Cycle target labelling	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
