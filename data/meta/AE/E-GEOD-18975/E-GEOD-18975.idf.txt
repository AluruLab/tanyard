Experiment Description	"To assess natural variation of downstream auxin responses we subjected 7 different arabidopsis ecotypes to a time course of auxin treatments. 7d-old seedlings grown in liquid culture have been treated for 0, 30 min, 1h and 3h with 1 ÂµM IAA. Experiment Overall Design: 83 samples were used in this experiment"

Protocol Type	labeling	nucleic_acid_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation
Protocol Description	Labelled using protocol described in Affymetrix manual 3' IVT Express Kit User Manual	Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol	"Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system"
