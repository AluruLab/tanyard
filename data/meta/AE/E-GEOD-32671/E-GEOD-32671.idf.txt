Investigation Title	Genes co-regulated by the NMD factors UPF2 and SMG5					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Genes co-regulated by the NMD factors UPF2 and SMG5					
Experiment Description	Eukaryotic cells have evolved a mechanism called nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) that detects and degrades aberrant mRNAs that contain premature termination codons (PTCs).  NMD has recently acquired broader importance as it has been found to regulate not only aberrant mRNAs but also a great diversity of transcripts, including wild type genes in mammals, Drosophila and yeast.  Seven proteins are the core of the NMD complex: SMG1, SMG2 (UPF1), SMG3 (UPF2), SMG4 (UPF3), SMG5, SMG6 and SMG7. Plants have orthologues of most of these proteins. We have identified and characterized a number of alleles of UPF1, UPF3 and SMG5 and made 35S:UPF2 RNAi (upf2i) transgenic plants, all of which share some phenotypic characteristics. Transcriptome analysis of upf1 and upf3 mutants has identified a subset of genes coregulated by UPF1 and UPF3 and, therefore, by NMD (unpublished data). By doing further transcriptome analysis on smg5 mutants and upf2i plants we aim to build a more robust subset of NMD targets in Arabidopsis.  RNA will be extracted from 17 day-old mutant, transgenic and wild type seedlings grown at 22-24 C under constant light. 6 samples were used in this experiment
