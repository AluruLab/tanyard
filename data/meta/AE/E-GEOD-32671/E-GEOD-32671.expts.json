NMD has recently acquired broader importance as it has been found to regulate not only aberrant mRNAs but also a great diversity of transcripts, including wild type genes in mammals, Drosophila and yeast.  Seven proteins are the core of the NMD complex: SMG1, SMG2 (UPF1), SMG3 (UPF2), SMG4 (UPF3), SMG5, SMG6 and SMG7. Plants have orthologues of most of these proteins. We have identified and characterized a number of alleles of UPF1, UPF3 and SMG5 and made 35S:UPF2 RNAi (upf2i) transgenic plants, all of which share some phenotypic characteristics. Transcriptome analysis of upf1 and upf3 mutants has identified a subset of genes coregulated by UPF1 and UPF3 and, therefore, by NMD (unpublished data). By doing further transcriptome analysis on smg5 mutants and upf2i plants we aim to build a more robust subset of NMD targets in Arabidopsis.  RNA will be extracted from 17 day-old mutant, transgenic and wild type seedlings grown at 22-24 C under constant light. 6 samples were used in this experiment"}],"provider":[{"contact":" Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC)","role":"submitter","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"},{"contact":"Luis Arciga-Reyes","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["smg5 mutant","upf2 RNAi","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["smg5 mutant","upf2 RNAi","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":441824,"accession":"P-GSE32671-2"},{"id":441819,"accession":"P-GSE32671-1"},{"id":441822,"accession":"P-GSE32671-4"},{"id":441823,"accession":"P-GSE32671-3"},{"id":441820,"accession":"P-GSE32671-6"},{"id":441821,"accession":"P-GSE32671-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
