Investigation Title	Arabidopsis pvip mutants						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Arabidopsis pvip mutants						
Experiment Description	Transcriptional comparison of Arabidopsis thaliana pvip1;pvip2 RNAi double mutants against Col-0 wildtype. Tissue used: whole rosettes of 4-week-old plants grown under short-day conditions (8h light; 20oC). 3 biological replicates for each. Control = Col-0 and mutant = pvip1;pvip2. PVIP = Potyvirus-VPg-interacting protein (Dunoyer et al. 2004 J. Virol. 78: 2301-2309). 6 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	"ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call"	"Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA."	"Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA"	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	"Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) and PVIP1 and PVIP2 RNAi transgenic lines (pvip1/pvip2; Dunoyer et al 2004, J Virol 78: 2301) were surface-sterilised in a desiccator by chlorine gas generated with a mixture of 100 ml commercial bleach and 3 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid for 4 h. Seeds were sown on MS agar (0.8%) that contained 20 mg/l phosphinothricin (Basta) for the pvip1/pvip2 line. After stratification in the dark at 4C for 3 days, the plates with the seeds were transferred to a growth room (20C, 16 h light). 14 days after germination, Col-0 plants and Basta-resistant pvip1/pvip2 plants were transferred to soil (Scotts Levington Special Custom Mix Compost with Intercept 5GR) and grown under short-day conditions (20C, 8 h light, 70% relative air humidity) for 3 weeks."	"Labelled using protocol described in manual &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual&quot;, One-Cycle target labelling"	"Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system"
