In this study, we intended to address the molecular basis that directs different plant tissues to form the root-meristem-like callus. We found that leaves, but not roots, of the Polycomb group (PcG) double mutant curly leaf-50 swinger-1 lost the ability to form a callus. Using ChIP-chip analysis, we identified genes that are changed markedly in the histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) levels during callus formation from leaf explants. Among these genes, a number of leaf-regulatory genes were repressed through PcG-mediated H3K27me3. Conversely, certain auxin pathway genes and many root-regulatory genes were derepressed through H3K27 demethylation. Our data indicate that genome-wide H3K27me3 reprogramming, through the PcG-mediated H3K27me3 and the H3K27 demethylation pathways, is critical in directing cell fate transition.
