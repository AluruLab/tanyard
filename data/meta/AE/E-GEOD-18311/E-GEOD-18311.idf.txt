Investigation Title	Comparison of gene expression in wild type and angustifoila3 leaf primorida							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Comparison of gene expression in wild type and angustifoila3 leaf primorida							
Experiment Description	Development of a flat structure of leaves depend on active expansion of leaf blades mediated by cell proliferation. The angustifolia3 (an3) mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana are defective in cell proliferation in leaf primorida. AN3 encodes a transcription coactivator and interacts with a putative transcription factor AtGRF5. To investigate how AN3 control cell proliferation, we compared gene expression profiles between an3 and wild type. This analysis provide an insight into AN3-dependent cell proliferation pathway. Comparison between an3-4 and wild type. Two replicates for each sample.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = signal<br>ABS_CALL = absent or present<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Standard affymetrix protocol	Plants were grown at 22C under continuous light.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method.	Standard affymetrix protocol	Leaf primordia were transferred to liquid nitrogen before RNA extraction	Total RNA was prepared using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 microg total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
