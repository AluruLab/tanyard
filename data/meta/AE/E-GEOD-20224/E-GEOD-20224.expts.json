Two transcription factors with verified function (bZIP and C2H2 ZF) were selected for the identification of their regulons. Mature pollen was isolated as published previously (Honys and Twell Plant Physiol 132:640-652, 2003) from Col-0 wild type plants and T-DNA insertion mutants (SAIL) homozygous for tested genes. 6 samples were used in this experiment."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC)","role":"submitter","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"},{"contact":"David Honys","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":[6.00]},{"category":"genetic background","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"stock code","value":["N1092","SAIL_1168_C11","SALK_018864"]},{"category":"tissue","value":["mature pollen"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"STOCK CODE","value":["N1092","SAIL_1168_C11","SALK_018864"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":48359,"accession":"P-GSE20224-1"},{"id":48360,"accession":"P-GSE20224-7"},{"id":48365,"accession":"P-GSE20224-6"},{"id":48363,"accession":"P-GSE20224-3"},{"id":48364,"accession":"P-GSE20224-2"},{"id":48362,"accession":"P-GSE20224-5"},{"id":48361,"accession":"P-GSE20224-4"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
