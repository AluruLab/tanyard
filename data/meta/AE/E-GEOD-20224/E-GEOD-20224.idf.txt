Experiment Description	Following our initial transcriptomic analyses of the male gametophyte development (Honys and Twell, Genome Biol 5:R85, 2004), we identified several candidate genes for the function of transcriptional regulators of the male gametophyte development. Two transcription factors with verified function (bZIP and C2H2 ZF) were selected for the identification of their regulons. Mature pollen was isolated as published previously (Honys and Twell Plant Physiol 132:640-652, 2003) from Col-0 wild type plants and T-DNA insertion mutants (SAIL) homozygous for tested genes. 6 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	Plants were grown in compost in a growth room as described (Honys and Twell, Plant Physiology 132: 640-652, 2003).	Labelled using protocol described in manual "Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual", One-Cycle target labelling	Biotin Labelled cRNA using "Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit", according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0-calculated signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call
