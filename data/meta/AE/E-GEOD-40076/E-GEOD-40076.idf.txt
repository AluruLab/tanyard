Investigation Title	Expression data from Arabidopsis roots and shoots grown with or without iron							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis roots and shoots grown with or without iron							
Experiment Description	Iron-deficiency repsonses in Arabidopsis are controlled by several bHLH transcription factors.  FIT, for example has been shown to direct iron-uptake responses.  However, the role of shoot and root expressed genes bHLH100 and bHLH101 has not be clarified.  We used microarray to study what genes might be miss-regulated in the double mutant bhlh100/bhlh101 background 10-day-old Arabidopsis plants were divided into root and shoot tissues and harvested for RNA extraction.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA normalization	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on ATH1 Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	10-day-old plants grown on 0.5X MS plates without or with (100 micromolar) iron.	The data were analyzed using simpleAffy from Bioconductor and RMA normalization.	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.	Plants were grown either in the absence of iron or in the presence of 100uM Fe.	Qiagen RNAeasy extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
