The ethanol was removed and replaced with 10% bleach/0.1% Tween-20 for a further 3 minutes . The samples were washed by rinsing with sterile H2O for 2 minutes; this was repeated 4 times. GA2oxOE seeds were plated onto plates containing 0.7% Gelrite (Duchefa)0.05% MES (Sigma), 1x Murashige and Skoog (Duchefa), 1% Sucrose (Duchefa) at pH 5.8. The plates were stood at an angle of 70o from the horizontal. The plants were grown under continuous light (150umol-2.sec-1)at 22C. After six days seedlings were either treated with water or 5 uM GA4 for 0, 30, 60 and 180 min. Approximately 400 hypocotyls were harvested per timepoint using a razorblade and after excision the hypocotyls were frozen in liquid nitrogen.
