Protocol Description	Fully expanded leaves from 5 week old plants were collected and pooled. Pools were incubated at 37°C in prewarmed SIB Buffer for 2h.<br><br>Then placed in a shaking water bath with 40 oscillations per minute. After treatment, excess of SIB buffer was rinsed off with sterile water; seeds were then blotted dry with filter paper and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.	Fully expanded leaves from 5 week old plants were collected and pooled. Pools were incubated at 22°C in prewarmed SIB Buffer for 2h.<br><br>Then placed in a shaking water bath with 40 oscillations per minute. After treatment, excess of SIB buffer was rinsed off with sterile water; seeds were then blotted dry with filter paper and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.	Frozen leaf tissues (-80°) were crushed by using mortar and pistil; and RNA was extracted with the Plant RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Signal Salk institute (http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.2.html).<br><br>Seeds were spread on soil or MS media and kept in the dark at 4-8°C to achieve a uniform germination. 10 DAG (days after germination) seedlings were singled out in individual pots and grown in soil with a light/dark cycle of 16/8 h at 22°C, 60% Relative Humidity (RH) and a light intensity of 5000 lumen m-2. All experiments were carried out with 5 week old plants.<br><br><br>(Parameters: start time = 5, time unit = weeks, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C, media = Soil)	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix EukGE-WS2v4 Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	The R package gcrma was used to normalize all data from the .cel files. This was done by using the implemented justGCRMA() command.
