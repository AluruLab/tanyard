Experiment Description	The purpose of this set of arrays is to provide a third replicate to use in data analysis addition to the 2 previous replicates for all samples already generated on this project. Our hypothesis is that adaptation to a calcareous environment will be reflected in altered gene expression including genes encoding transporters, ion channels, transcription factors, etc. To test this hypothesis we grew a laboratory non-calcicole (Col-4) and a laboratory calcicole (Cal-0) ecotypes of A. thaliana at low (1 mM) and high (12.5 mM) rhizospheric Ca2+ and compare the patterns of gene expression by microarray analysis. We then collected from the wild, a putative calcicole ecotype (Elland)and a putative non-calcicole (Penicuik) and grew both at low (1 mM) and high (12.5 mM) rhizospheric Ca2+ and compared expression profiles to the laboratory ecotypes.
