Experiment Description	To identify transcripts that are regulated by putative transcriptional co-activators, WT (Col) and KO of heat responsive transcriptional co-activator (Multiprotein Bridging Factor 1c) in Arabidopsis were subjeted to heat stress. These plants were compared to find transcripts that are regulated by the transcriptional co-activator during heat stress.
