Experiment Description	"The Arabidopsis thaliana Imitation Switch (AtISWI) subfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors play essential roles in plant development. Here we show that the DDT domain transcription factor RINGLET (RLT) form a complex with AtISWI. RLT1 physically interacts with CHR11 in yeast cells. Single mutants rlt1-1 and rlt2-1 show no obvious developmental defects, while the rlt1-1 rlt2-1 double mutant phenocopies the AtISWI mutant chr11-1 chr17-1. In addtion, the RLT-ISWI complex selectively represses SEPALLATA, FRUITFULL and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1, but not AGAMOUS and PISTILLATA in leaves. Leaves from 15-day-old seedlings of wild-type Col-0 and rlt1-1 rlt2-1 were used for RNA preparation.In the experiment data,3a3b refers to rlt1-1 rlt2-1."

Protocol Description	no treatment	Extract and purify the total RNA by the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit.Reverse Transcription to Synthesize First-Strand cDNA is primed with  T7 oligo(dT) primer to synthesize cDNA containing a T7 promoter sequence.Second-Strand cDNA Synthesis converts the single-stranded cDNA into  a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) template for transcription. The reaction employs DNA polymerase and RNase H to simultaneously degrade the RNA  and synthesize second strand cDNA.	"16 h light, 8 h dark, 21Â°C"	"In Vitro Transcription to Synthesize Biotin-Modified aRNA with IVT Labeling Master Mix generates multiple copies of biotin-modified aRNA from  the double-stranded cDNA templates; this is the amplification step.aRNA Purification removes unincorporated NTPs, salts, enzymes, and  inorganic phosphate to improve the stability of the biotin-modified aRNA."	Fragmentation of the labeled aRNA prepares the target for hybridization to GeneChipÂ® 3â expression arrays with GeneChipÂ® hybridization oven 640.	"Wash and stain the arrays with GeneChipÂ® fluidics station 450, Scan the arrays with the GeneArray scanner 3000 by the GeneChipÂ® Operating  Software (GCOS) or Command ConsoleÂ® (AGCC) Software."	RMA data were obtained by using Partek GS 6.4.	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA signal
