Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression analysis of the effect of protoplasting and sorting in roots exposed to low pH													
Experiment Description	To estimate the effect of protoplasting and sorting on low pH-regulated gene expression, we generated expression profiles for whole roots treated with low pH for 24 hours and whole roots that had been protoplasted and FACS sorted after 24 hours of exposure to low pH. Stress responses in plants are tightly coordinated with developmental processes, but the interaction between these pathways is poorly understood. Here we use genome-wide assays at high spatial and temporal resolution to understand the processes that lnk development and stress in the Arabidopsis root. Our meta-analysis finds little evidence for a universal stress response. Common stress responses appear to exists and, analagous to animal systems, many of them show cell-type specificity, suggesting a convergent evolutionary theme in multicellular organisms. Common stress responses may be mediated by cell identity regulators, as mutations in these genes resulted in altered responses to stress. Our results reveal surprising linkages between stress and development at cellular resolution, and show the power of multiple genome-wide datasets to elucidate biological processes. 3 replicates of protoplasted, FACS sorted whole roots exposed to low pH and 2 replicates of whole roots exposed to low pH
