Experiment Description	Goal:identify the genes regulated by RON2 involved in the delay of floral transitional and those associated with leaf development. The gene expression profile of mature leaf 6 of ron2-1 EMS mutant and the wild-type Ler are compared. The plant material for this experiment was grown in LEPSE-INRA Montpellier, and the microarrays at the MAF-VIB Leuven with PSB-VIB Ghent.

Protocol Description	3 pools of the 6th leaf of 10 to 15 plants were harvested 11 days after the leaf6 initiation and at least 4 hours after the beginning of the photoperiod. Plants were at growth stage 1.06 (Boyes et al., 2001)	Light in the growth chamber was provided by a bank of cool-white fluorescent tubes and sodium lamps. Air humidity was maintained at approximately 70 % and air temperature was maintained between 20.5 and 21.5  C. Seeds were stored at 4  C before sowing and then five seeds were sown in cylindrical pots (53 mm diameter and 88 mm height) containing a 50:50 mixture (v/v) of loamy soil and organic compost. To avoid population density effects, young seedlings were thinned to one plant per pot 10 d after plant germination. The substrate was maintained at 80 % of field capacity (corresponding to a soil water content of 0.50 g g-1 of dry soil) by weighing the pots once a d and watering them with a modified one-tenth strength Hoagland's solution with additional micronutrients (Hoagland & Arnon, 1950). Plants were grown under a 10 h photoperiod with a daily PPFD of 9.2 mol m2 d-1 to harvest leaf material for microarray analysis. 	Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies Gaithersburg MD, USA)	The experimental design comprised 3 replicates of each genotype, one replicate corresponding to one RNA extraction on an independent pool of about 10 to 15 leaves.	Affymetrix  Labelling protocol for ARE-ATH1 array  The labelling protocol is applicable for use with the GeneChip ARE-ATH1 when starting with a minimal amount of 5ug total RNA.  The protocol is derived from the ÂGeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Technical ManualÂ (Section 2 Eukaryotic sample and array processing). The document can be found at the affymetrix website: http://www.affymetrix.com/support/downloads/manuals/expression_s2_manual.pdf   Within this document (expression_s2_manual.pdf), the following sections are applicable for the labelling protocol:  2.1.3 Eukaryotic Target Preparation 2.1.7 - 2.1.8 Reagents and Materials Required 2.1.13 - 2.1.18 One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis  2.1.32 - 2.1.33 Cleanup of Double Stranded cDNA for Both the One-Cycle and Two-Cycle Target Labelling Assays 2.1.34 - 2.1.35 Synthesis of Biotin-Labelled cRNA for both the One-Cycle and Two-Cycle Target Labelling Assays. 2.1.36 2.1.38Â Cleanup and Quantification of Biotin-Labelled cRNA 2.1.39 Â 2.1.40 Fragmenting the cRNA for Target Preparation 	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	Expression data calculated with GCRMA method (Bioconductor; Bioinformatics 20, 307 315).
