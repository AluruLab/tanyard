Air humidity was maintained at approximately 70 % and air temperature was maintained between 20.5 and 21.5  C. Seeds were stored at 4  C before sowing and then five seeds were sown in cylindrical pots (53 mm diameter and 88 mm height) containing a 50:50 mixture (v\/v) of loamy soil and organic compost. To avoid population density effects, young seedlings were thinned to one plant per pot 10 d after plant germination. The substrate was maintained at 80 % of field capacity (corresponding to a soil water content of 0.50 g g-1 of dry soil) by weighing the pots once a d and watering them with a modified one-tenth strength Hoagland's solution with additional micronutrients (Hoagland & Arnon, 1950).
