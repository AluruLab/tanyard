Investigation Title	Expression data of Arabidopsis seedlings in response to ARR1 or cytokinins, in the presence and absence of DELLA proteins						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data of Arabidopsis seedlings in response to ARR1 or cytokinins, in the presence and absence of DELLA proteins
Experiment Description	DELLA proteins interact with ARR1 and modulate its activity. We have investigated the effect of DELLA proteins on transcriptional regulation by ARR1 A dominant hyperactive allele of ARR1 was induced with dexamethasone in seedlings preincubated with paclobutrazol (allowing DELLA acummulation) or paclobutrazol+GA3 (promoting DELLA degradation)

Protocol Description	Expression estimates were calculated using gcRMA implemented in R with standard settings. Statistical analysis was performed using Z-score transformation, and selecting differential genes with p<0.05. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 GC-RMA signal	Arabidopsis RNA samples were processed and biotin labeled for array hybridization using the GeneChip 3’ IVT Express Kit from Affymetrix(Affymetrix, catalogue number 901229)	Fragmented aRNA was hybridized to Arabidopsis Genome ATH1 Arrays for 16 hours at 45°C (at 60 rpm) (Affymetrix GeneChip® Hybridization, Wash, and Stain Kit, catalogue number 900720).Arrays were washed and stained using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	5-day-old seedlings were transferred to liquid MS, subsequently treatments were performed by adding the respective chemicals at the following timings and concentrations: 10 μM paclobutrazol or 10 μM paclobutrazol + 50 μM GA3 for 18 hours and 5μM dexamethasone or 5 µM N6-benzyladenine (BA) for 3 hours.	Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia accession) and transgenic line 35S::ARR1∆DDK-GR seeds were sown on MS plates after sterilization. Plants were grown at 22ºC under continuous light (~50 μmol m−2 s−1).	Total RNA was extracted from the whole tissue of 5-day-old plants with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions.	Arrays were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 3000 7G.
