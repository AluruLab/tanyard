Experiment Description	In our laboratory we are interested in studying the functions of WRKY zink finger type transcription factors. There are 74 members of this gene family in Arabidopsis.  WRKY factors are key regulators of distinct plant defense responses and are involved in certain developmental programs e.g. plant senescence.  We would like to determine the functions of a small sub-group (group II-a) of WRKY factors.  Our aim to compare and contrast the gene expression profiles of 35 days-old untreated wild type and WRKY T-DNA knockout plants grown in a growth chamber under long day growth conditions.  All plants chosen at this stage showed slight yellowing of the first two to four leaves.
