Experiment Description	In Arabidopsis, jasmonate is required for stamen and pollen maturation.  Mutants deficient in jasmonate synthesis, such as opr3, are male-sterile but become fertile when jasmonate is applied to developing flower buds. We have used ATH1 oligonucleotide arrays to follow gene expression in opr3 stamens for 22 hours following jasmonate treatment.  In these experiments, a total of 821 genes were specifically induced by jasmonate and 480 repressed.  Comparisons with data from previous studies indicate that these genes constitute a stamen-specific jasmonate transcriptome, with a large proportion (70%) of the genes expressed in the sporophytic tissue but not in the pollen.  Bioinformatics tools allowed us to associate many of the induced genes with metabolic pathways that are likely up-regulated during jasmonate-induced maturation.  Our pathway analysis led to the identification of specific genes within larger families of homologues that apparently encode stamen-specific isozymes.  Extensive additional analysis of our dataset identified 13 transcription factors that may be key regulators of the stamen maturation processes triggered by jasmonate.  Two of these transcription factors, MYB21 and MYB24, are the only members of subgroup 19 of the R2R3 family of MYB proteins.  A myb21 mutant obtained by reverse genetics exhibited shorter anther filaments, delayed anther dehiscence and greatly reduced male fertility.  A myb24 mutant was phenotypically wild type, but production of a myb21Â myb24 double mutant indicated that introduction of the myb24 mutation exacerbated all three aspects of the myb21 phenotype.  Exogenous jasmonate could not restore fertility to myb21 or myb21Â myb24 mutant plants.  Together with the data from transcriptional profiling, these results indicate that MYB21 and MYB24 are induced by jasmonate and mediate important aspects of the jasmonate response during stamen development. Experiment Overall Design: Three replicates for opr3 at each time point of 0 hour, 30 minutes, 2 hours, 8 hours and 22 hourss of either JA or OPDA treatment. One replicate of wild-type stamens. <br><br>Note that data files GSM106833.txt and GSM106907.txt as downloaded from GEO are identical.

Protocol Description	Plants were grown on soil under continuous illumination of 130 mmol m-2s-1 at 22 0C.	Flower buds at developmental stage 12 from opr3 mutants were treated with 0.03% methyl jasmonate and stamens were harvested 30 minutes, 2, 8 or 22 hours after treatment and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen	Flower buds at developmental stage 12 from opr3 mutants were treated with 0.03% 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) and stamens were harvested 30 minutes, 2, 8 or 22 hours after treatment and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen	Total RNA was isolated from stamens (stage 12 of flower development) using Trizol reagent following instructions from the manufacturer (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) and was then purified on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).	Labeling and hybridization of RNA was carried out according to standard Affymetrix protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).  In brief, ten micrograms of total RNA for each replicate was converted to cDNA, from which biotinylated cRNA target was synthesized.  The resulting cRNA was purified on RNeasy columns and then fragmented for hybridization to ATH1 Arabidopsis GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol.
