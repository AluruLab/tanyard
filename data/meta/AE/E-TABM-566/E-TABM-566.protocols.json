The shoot apex of plants (comprising shoot apex meristem, first and second leaf primordia at petiole-less stage) were harvested at the growth stage 1.0 removing the cotyledons and the hypocotyls and at least 4 hours after the beginning of the photoperiod when photosynthetic and metabolic activities of plants are stable (Boyes et al., 2001). The age of the plants at the harvesting step were between 11 and 18 days after sowing depending of the delay in mutant development.
