Experiment Description	Inflorescence stages 1 to 12 from mutants involved in Arabidopsis small RNA metabolism. Three biological replicates of each mutant comprising at least 9 independent plants were harvested, and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix ATH1 arrays.  Comparisons among the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by small RNAs (microRNAs and siRNAs).
