Investigation Title	Effect of PCO1 overexpression [hypoxia]						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Effect of PCO1 overexpression [hypoxia]						
Experiment Description	The effect of the overexpression of Plant Cysteine Oxidase (PDCO1) on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis resettes was investigated with plants  subjected to a 4h hypoxia (5% O2 v/v in air). For this purpose, 4-week old rosette of wild-type and 35S:FLAG:CDO1 plants were compared. Samples were composed of pools of 5 plants. In total, 6 samples were analyzes, subdivided in 2 thesis with 3 replicates each. 35S:PCO1 plants (treated with hypoxia) were compared to wild-type plants (treated with hypoxia).

Protocol Description	RMA algorithm using RobinA software (PMID:22684630) ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 RMA signal	Affymetrix standard labeling protocol	Affymetrix standard hybridization protocol	Plants were treated in the darkness at 5% O2 v/v in air for 4h at 10am in the morning, 2h after the start of the day	Seeds were sown in 6-cm diameter pots containing moisted Arabidopsis soil. The seeds were stratified at 4ﾰC in the dark for 2 days and then the pots were moved in a growth chamber at short photoperiodic conditions (8h light 16 h darkness) with 18ﾰC in the night and 22ﾰC in the day.	Total RNA was extracted from whole 5-week old plants using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. RNA was processed for use on Affymetrix Arabidopsis Genome GeneChip arrays.	Affymetrix standard scan protocol
