Experiment Description	Comparison of BOLITA mutant leaves (gain-of-function mutant) vs. wild type leaves, grown in the same conditions.  The BOLITA (BOL) gene (At1g24590), an AP2/ERF transcription factor, was characterized with the help of an activation tag mutant and overexpression lines in Arabidopsis and tobacco. The leaf size of plants overexpressing BOL was smaller than wild type plants due to a reduction in both cell size and cell number. Moreover, severe overexpressors showed ectopic callus formation in roots. Accordingly, global gene expression analysis using the overexpression mutant reflected the alterations in cell proliferation, differentiation and growth through expression changes in RBR, CYCD, and TCP genes, as well as genes involved in cell expansion (i.e. expansins and the actin remodeling factor ADF5). Furthermore, the expression of hormone signaling (i.e. auxin and cytokinin), biosynthesis (i.e. ethylene and jasmonic acid) and regulatory genes was found to be perturbed in bol-D mutant leaves. The gene is expressed at the shoot apical meristem, and more intensely at leaf primordia. It is also expressed at very young leaves, and flower buds. The gene is closely related to DORNROSCHEN.

Protocol Description	Plants were grown in soil in a temperature controlled greenhouse at 22Â°C, with more than 12 hours of light. The youngest leaves larger than 2 mm. emerging from the rosette of greenhouse grown plants (4 weeks old) were used. The samples were collected in the middle of the day at the end of the winter in The Netherlands (March 15th). For the biological replicates, three to four mutant or two wild type leaves from different plants were pooled for one sample, and the same amount from different plants for the second sample. 	Total RNA was extracted according to the instructions of the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
