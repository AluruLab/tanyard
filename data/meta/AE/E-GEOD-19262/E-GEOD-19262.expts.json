Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants were grown for approximately 2 weeks on solid ATS medium (1) containing a final concentration of 10 um NPA (dissolved in DMSO) or an equivalent volume of DMSO (control). At this stage plants had approximately 6 rosette leaves. RNA was prepared from entire shoot tissues of control (DMSO) or NPA-treated plants.(1) Lincoln et al., 1990.
