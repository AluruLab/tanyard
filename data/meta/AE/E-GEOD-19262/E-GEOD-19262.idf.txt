Comment[Submitted Name]	NPA-induced vascular overgrowth in Arabidopsis
Experiment Description	We used N-(1-naphthyl) phthalamic acid (NPA)-induced vascular overgrowth in Arabidopsis leaves to look for differential up-regulation of genes in NPA-treated tissues that may be involved in vascular differentiation. Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants were grown for approximately 2 weeks on solid ATS medium (1) containing a final concentration of 10 um NPA (dissolved in DMSO) or an equivalent volume of DMSO (control). At this stage plants had approximately 6 rosette leaves. RNA was prepared from entire shoot tissues of control (DMSO) or NPA-treated plants.(1) Lincoln et al., 1990. Plant Cell 2: 1071-1080. 2 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M) DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	see Chang et al. 1993. Biology Reporter 11: 113-116	Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 were sterilized with chlorine gas and plated onto sterile ATS media (Lincoln et al., 1990) supplemented with either N-(1-Naphthyl) phthalamic acid (NPA; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in DMSO to a final concentration of 10 mM, or an equivalent volume of DMSO for control material. Seeds were stratified for at least 2 days at 4C and then grown at ca 20C with 16h illumination for 2 weeks (shoot material). Shoot tissues were immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen after excision, stored at -80C, and total RNA purified according to Chang et al. (1993). Lincoln et al. 1990. Plant Cell 2: 1071-1080 Chang et al. 1993. Biology Reporter 11: 113-116	Labelled using protocol described in manual &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual&quot;, One-Cycle target labelling	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
