Experiment Description	This study was aimed to determine roles of individual myosins in organelle trafficking in plant cell.  Expression of Myosin XI-K was suppressed in transgenic A.thaliana by using RNAi approach. To ensure that the RNAi-induced gene silencing was specific and did not affect expression of other myosins, a microarray analysis was performed.  Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was purified from A.thaliana plants transformed with an inverted repeat construct harbouring a sequence derived from Myosin XI-K ORF. 3 independent groups of plants were used for comparison of the expression profiles of 17 myosin RNAs to a control group comprised of plants constitutively expressing GUS ORF as a transgene.	
Protocol Name	P-G5431-2	P-G5431-1	
Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	
Protocol Description	Total RNA was purified using RNeasy Plant Mini kit (QIAGEN). 5 mkg of total RNA was used to generate biotinylated complementary RNA (cRNA) using the One-Cycle Target Labeling protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) from the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual ( 701021 Rev. 5 ).	Biotinylated cRNA was synthesized from the double stranded cDNA using T7 RNA polymerase and a biotin-conjugated pseudouridine containing nucleotide mixture provided in the IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) .
