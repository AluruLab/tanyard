Expression of Myosin XI-K was suppressed in transgenic A.thaliana by using RNAi approach. To ensure that the RNAi-induced gene silencing was specific and did not affect expression of other myosins, a microarray analysis was performed.  Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was purified from A.thaliana plants transformed with an inverted repeat construct harbouring a sequence derived from Myosin XI-K ORF. 3 independent groups of plants were used for comparison of the expression profiles of 17 myosin RNAs to a control group comprised of plants constitutively expressing GUS ORF as a transgene."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Valera Peremyslov","role":"submitter","email":"peremisv@bcc.orst.edu"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"Compound","value":["myosin XI-K","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":61799,"accession":"P-G5431-2"},{"id":61800,"accession":"P-G5431-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
