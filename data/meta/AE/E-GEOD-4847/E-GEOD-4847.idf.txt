Experiment Description	Tocopherols (Vitamin E) are lipophilic antioxidants that are synthesized by all plants and are particularly abundant in seeds.  Two tocopherol deficient mutant loci were used to examine how tocopherol deficiency impacts global gene expression during the critical peroid of germination and early seedling development when tocopherols are essential.  vte1 lacks all tocopherols, but accumulates the tocopherol pathway intermediate DMPBQ,.  vte2 which lacks all tocopherols and pathway intermediates. We used microarrays to examine the global gene expression in early seedlings and identify distinct classes of genes whose expression is affected by tocopherol deficient mutants vte1 and vte2. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on media containing MS salts at 22C and RNA was extracted from 1 (1D)and 3 (3D)day old seedlings following cold treatment to break dormancy and synchronize germination (5 days at 6C) .   We sought to compare the two tocopherol deficient mutants vte1 (VTE1) and vte2 (VTE2) with each other and the corresponding wild-type background Columbia-0 (COL).

Protocol Description	seedlings were germinate under 12hr photoperiod (100 photons umol m-1 s-1) at 22C following 5 days at 6C to break dormancy.	seedlings were grown on Petri plates containing 0.5X Murashige and Skoog basal medium (MS salts; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 1.0% phytoagar.	Approximately 100 mg of seedlings were frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted using the RNAqueous RNA extraction kit and the Plant RNA Isolation Aid (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's protocol.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 15 microg total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
