Comment[Submitted Name]	Differential expression between frb1 mutant Arabidopsis and wild-type						
Experiment Description	Cell adhesion in plants is mediated predominantly by pectins, a group of complex cell wall associated polysaccharides. An Arabidopsis mutant, friable1 (frb1), was identified through a screen of T-DNA insertion lines that exhibited defective cell adhesion. Interestingly, the frb1 plants displayed both cell and organ dissociations and also ectopic organ fusions. The FRB1 gene encodes a Golgi-localized, plant specific protein with only weak sequence similarities to known proteins (DUF246). Unlike other cell adhesion deficient mutants, frb1 mutants do not have reduced levels of adhesion related cell wall polymers, such as pectins. Instead, FRB1 affects the abundance of galactose- and arabinose-containing oligosaccharides in the Golgi. Furthermore, frb1 mutants displayed alteration in pectin methylesterification, cell wall associated extensins and xyloglucan microstructure. We propose that abnormal FRB1 action has pleiotropic consequences on wall architecture, affecting both the extensin and pectin matrices, with consequent changes to the biomechanical properties of the wall and middle lamella, thereby influencing cell-cell adhesion. Microarrays were used to determine the differences in global expression of friable1 mutant plants, which have cell adhesion defects, and compared these to wild-type plants. RNA was extracted from seedlings grown on 0.5X MS for 10 days under constant illumination.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Signal<br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	Trizol method according to manufacterer's instructions.	Seeds were sown onto 0.5 MS, kept at 4C for 4 days in the dark and transferred to 21C at 200 uE/m/s  for 10 days.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100.
