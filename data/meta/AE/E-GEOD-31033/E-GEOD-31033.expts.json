An Arabidopsis mutant, friable1 (frb1), was identified through a screen of T-DNA insertion lines that exhibited defective cell adhesion. Interestingly, the frb1 plants displayed both cell and organ dissociations and also ectopic organ fusions. The FRB1 gene encodes a Golgi-localized, plant specific protein with only weak sequence similarities to known proteins (DUF246). Unlike other cell adhesion deficient mutants, frb1 mutants do not have reduced levels of adhesion related cell wall polymers, such as pectins. Instead, FRB1 affects the abundance of galactose- and arabinose-containing oligosaccharides in the Golgi. Furthermore, frb1 mutants displayed alteration in pectin methylesterification, cell wall associated extensins and xyloglucan microstructure. We propose that abnormal FRB1 action has pleiotropic consequences on wall architecture, affecting both the extensin and pectin matrices, with consequent changes to the biomechanical properties of the wall and middle lamella, thereby influencing cell-cell adhesion. Microarrays were used to determine the differences in global expression of friable1 mutant plants, which have cell adhesion defects, and compared these to wild-type plants. RNA was extracted from seedlings grown on 0.5X MS for 10 days under constant illumination."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Dario Bonetta","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Shelley Lumba","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Dario Bonetta","role":"submitter","email":"dario.bonetta@uoit.ca"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":22916179,"authors":"Neumetzler L, Humphrey T, Lumba S, Snyder S, Yeats TH, Usadel B, Vasilevski A, Patel J, Rose JK, Persson S, Bonetta D.","title":"The FRIABLE1 gene product affects cell adhesion in Arabidopsis.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["frb1 mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"germplasm","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["frb1 mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1127349,"accession":"P-GSE31033-1"},{"id":1127355,"accession":"P-GSE31033-2"},{"id":1127354,"accession":"P-GSE31033-3"},{"id":1127353,"accession":"P-GSE31033-4"},{"id":1127352,"accession":"P-GSE31033-5"},{"id":1127351,"accession":"P-GSE31033-7"},{"id":1127350,"accession":"P-GSE31033-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
