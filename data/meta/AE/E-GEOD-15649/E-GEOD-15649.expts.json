Additionally, the per1 mutant exhibited a pleiotropic phenotype under control conditions, resembling Pi-deficient plants in several aspects. Under Pi deficiency, the accumulation of Pi and iron was increased in the mutant when compared to the wild-type. Inhibition of root hair elongation upon growth on low Pi media was reverted by treatment with the Pi analog phosphite, suggesting that the mutant phenotype is not the result of a defect in Pi sensing. Reciprocal grafting experiments revealed that the mutant rootstock is sufficient to cause the phenotype. Transcriptional profiling of per1 and wild-type plants subjected to short-term Pi starvation revealed genes that may be important for the signaling of Pi deficiency. We conclude that UBP14 function is crucial for adapting root development to the prevailing local availability of phosphate. Experiment Overall Design: Col-0 and per1 mutant plants were grown under control conditions or subjected to phosphate starvation for 10 h"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Wolfgang Schmidt","role":"submitter","email":"wolfgang.schmidt@meduniwien.ac.at"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19969521,"authors":"Li WF, Perry PJ, Prafulla NN, Schmidt W.","title":"Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (UBP14) is involved in root responses to phosphate deficiency in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1093\/mp\/ssp086","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["per1 mutant","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["per1 mutant","wild_type"]},{"name":"GROWTH CONDITION","value":["control","phosphate deprivation"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":8,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":449800,"accession":"P-G15649-2"},{"id":449801,"accession":"P-G15649-1"},{"id":449799,"accession":"P-G15649-4"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":449798,"accession":"P-G15649-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
