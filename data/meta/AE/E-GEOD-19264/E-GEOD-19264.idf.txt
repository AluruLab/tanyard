Comment[ArrayExpressAccession]	E-GEOD-19264						Public Release Date	2009-12-09						Investigation Title	Systemic responses to Pseudomonas syringae infection						Comment[Submitted Name]	Systemic responses to Pseudomonas syringae infection						Experiment Description	"We used three different strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 to investigate systemic responses to infection in Arabidopsis and the development of SAR. Wildtype DC3000, the hrpA mutant and DC3000 carrying the avirulence gene avrRpm1 were syringe infiltrated into 4-week-old plants at a concentration of 10e8 cfu/ml. At least 5 leaves per plant were infiltrated and at least 10 plants were pooled for each sample. Systemic, uninfected tissue was then harvested at 8, 12 and 21h after inoculation. Three independent experiments were carried out to give three biological replicates for each timepoint. 27 samples were used in this experiment."						Date of Experiment							Term Source Name	EFO						Term Source Version							Term Source File	http://bar.ebi.ac.uk:8080/trac/browser/branches/curator/ExperimentalFactorOntology/ExFactorInOWL/currentrelease/eforelease/efo.owl						Person Last Name	Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC)	Truman					Person First Name		William					Person Mid Initials							Person Email	affy@arabidopsis.info						Person Affiliation	Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC)						Person Phone	+44 (0)115 951 3237						Person Fax	+44 (0)115 951 3297						Person Address	"School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC), Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough, United Kingdom"						Person Roles	submitter						Person Roles Term Source REF							Person Roles Term Accession Number							Normalization Type							Normalization Term Accession Number							Normalization Term Source REF							Replicate Type							Replicate Term Accession Number							Replicate Term Source REF							Experimental Design							Experimental Design Term Accession Number							Experimental Design Term Source REF							Quality Control Type							Quality Control Term Accession Number							Quality Control Term Source REF							Protocol Name	P-GSE19264-1	P-GSE19264-6	P-GSE19264-5	P-GSE19264-3	P-GSE19264-2	P-GSE19264-4	P-GSE19264-7Protocol Description	"ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call"	"Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA."
