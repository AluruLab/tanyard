Wildtype DC3000, the hrpA mutant and DC3000 carrying the avirulence gene avrRpm1 were syringe infiltrated into 4-week-old plants at a concentration of 10e8 cfu\/ml. At least 5 leaves per plant were infiltrated and at least 10 plants were pooled for each sample. Systemic, uninfected tissue was then harvested at 8, 12 and 21h after inoculation. Three independent experiments were carried out to give three biological replicates for each timepoint. 27 samples were used in this experiment."}],"provider":[{"contact":" Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC)","role":"submitter","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"},{"contact":"William Truman","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["Boyes key 3.9"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-5"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"infect","value":["Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000","Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 avrRpm1","Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 hrpA mutant"]},{"name":"time","value":["12 hour","21 hour","8 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":27,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1128241,"accession":"P-GSE19264-5"},{"id":1128242,"accession":"P-GSE19264-4"},{"id":1128240,"accession":"P-GSE19264-7"},{"id":1128239,"accession":"P-GSE19264-6"},{"id":1128238,"accession":"P-GSE19264-1"},{"id":1128243,"accession":"P-GSE19264-3"},{"id":1128244,"accession":"P-GSE19264-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":27,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":27,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":27,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":27,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":27,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":27,"isderived":0}]}]}}
