Arabidopsis were well-watered until after just bolting (after 24 days growth with the main stem about 1 cm high) when drought treatment was started by withholding water (defined as day 0 for drought treatment). The relative soil moisture content decreased sharply and, after about 80 hours (defined as day 3 for drought treatment), the relative soil moisture content was near 35% of the soil water-holding capacity. The soil water condition was maintained by daily watering until almost all the fruits were mature and ready to harvest (about 50 days). For well-watered (control) plants, 90% of the soil water-holding capacity was maintained until tissue harvest or after seed maturation (pots were weighed and watered twice per day). Unopened flower samples were collected, from both treated and control plants, at day 0, 3, 4, 5, 10."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Zhao Su","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Hong Ma","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Zhao SU","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["Arabidopsis at day 24 after seed germination","Arabidopsis at day 28 after seed germination","Arabidopsis at day 29 after seed germination","Arabidopsis at day 30 after seed germination","Arabidopsis at day 34 after seed germination"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["Unopen flower buds"]},{"category":"sample date","value":[0,"10 days later","3 days later","4 days later","5 days later"]},{"category":"stress","value":["drought-treated","well-watered"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"AGE","value":["Arabidopsis at day 24 after seed germination","Arabidopsis at day 28 after seed germination","Arabidopsis at day 29 after seed germination","Arabidopsis at day 30 after seed germination","Arabidopsis at day 34 after seed germination"]},{"name":"SAMPLE DATE","value":[0,"10 days later","3 days later","4 days later","5 days later"]},{"name":"STRESS","value":["drought-treated","well-watered"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":899939,"accession":"P-GSE40998-1"},{"id":899944,"accession":"P-GSE40998-2"},{"id":899945,"accession":"P-GSE40998-3"},{"id":899943,"accession":"P-GSE40998-4"},{"id":899942,"accession":"P-GSE40998-5"},{"id":899941,"accession":"P-GSE40998-6"},{"id":899940,"accession":"P-GSE40998-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0}]}]}}
