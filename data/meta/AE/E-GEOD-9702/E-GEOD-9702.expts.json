For these experiments, we used 35S::AP3-GR transgenic plants in a 35S::PI, ap3-3 null mutant background for various dex or mock treatments. RNA was extracted from inflorescences at 0 and 4 hours after dex or a mock treatment and used as probes for our microarray experiments. Three biological replicates of each were hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays. We used the Affymetrix Microarray Suite software (MAS) to identify genes whose expression profiles changed only after dex-treatment and are likely targets of AP3\/PI. Experiment Overall Design: For these experiments, we used 35S::AP3-GR transgenic plants in a 35S::PI, ap3-3 null mutant background for various DEX or MOCK treatments. RNA was extracted from inflorescences at 0 and 4 hours after DEX or a MOCK treatment and used as probes for our microarray experiments.

We used the Affymetrix Microarray Suite software (MAS 5.0) to identify genes whose expression profiles changed only after DEX-treatment and are likely targets of AP3\/PI."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Chloe Mara","role":"submitter","email":"vivian.irish@yale.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":18417639,"authors":"Mara CD, Irish VF.","title":"Two GATA transcription factors are downstream effectors of floral homeotic gene action in Arabidopsis.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"genotype","value":["35S::AP3-GR, ap3-3, 35S::PI"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["flower bud"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["dexamethasone","none"]},{"name":"time","value":["0 hour","4 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1125515,"accession":"P-G9702-2"},{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":1125514,"accession":"P-G9702-1"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
