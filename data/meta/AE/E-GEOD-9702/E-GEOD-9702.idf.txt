For these experiments, we used 35S::AP3-GR transgenic plants in a 35S::PI, ap3-3 null mutant background for various dex or mock treatments. RNA was extracted from inflorescences at 0 and 4 hours after dex or a mock treatment and used as probes for our microarray experiments. Three biological replicates of each were hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays. We used the Affymetrix Microarray Suite software (MAS) to identify genes whose expression profiles changed only after dex-treatment and are likely targets of AP3/PI. Experiment Overall Design: For these experiments, we used 35S::AP3-GR transgenic plants in a 35S::PI, ap3-3 null mutant background for various DEX or MOCK treatments. RNA was extracted from inflorescences at 0 and 4 hours after DEX or a MOCK treatment and used as probes for our microarray experiments. Three biological replicates of each were hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays. We used the Affymetrix Microarray Suite software (MAS 5.0) to identify genes whose expression profiles changed only after DEX-treatment and are likely targets of AP3/PI."					Protocol Name	P-G9702-2	P-G9702-1	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown	P-AFFY-6	Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat	Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	Protocol Description	"Flower buds were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol (GibcoBRL, Fredrick, MD, USA) reagent and protocol. RNA was cleaned using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (GmbH, Hamburg, Germany)."	Single stranded cDNA is synthesized by reverse transcription using the poly (A) RNA present in the starting total RNA sample.  Single stranded cDNA is then converted into double stranded cDNA and purified using the Affymetrix Cleanup Module.  An in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction is then carried out overnight in the presence of biotinylated UTP and CTP to produce biotin-labeled cRNA from the double stranded cDNA.
