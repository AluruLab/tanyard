Experiment Description	The study of natural genetic variation for plant disease resistance responses is a complementary approach to utilizing mutants to elucidate genetic pathways.  While some key genes involved in pathways controlling disease resistance, and signaling intermediates such as salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), have been identified through mutational analyses, the use of genetic variation in natural populations permits the identification of change-of-function alleles, which likely act in a quantitative manner.  Whole genome microarrays, such as Affymetrix GeneChips, allow for molecular characterization of the disease response at a genomics level and characterization of differences in gene expression due to natural variation.  Differences in the level of gene expression, or expression level polymorphisms (ELPs), can be mapped in a segregating population to identify regulatory quantitative trait loci (expression QTLs, eQTLs) affecting host resistance responses.  We surveyed recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a population derived from a cross of inbred Arabidopsis accessions Bayreuth-0 (Bay-0) and Shahdara (Sha) in order to map eQTLs controlling ELPs.  We treated vegetatively grown plants with either SA or a control solution (Silwet), and harvested the plants 28 hours after chemical treatment.  Here we present Affymetrix GeneChip microarray expression data for 8 biological replications of the control (Silwet) samples for Bay-0 and Sha.

Protocol Description	Seeds of  Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Bay-0; Sha; and Bay-0 x Sha RILs originally developed by O.

Loudet (http://www.inra.fr/qtlat), were obtained from ABRC through TAIR (www.arabidopsis.org).   Due to limitations in growth chamber space,  two biological replications of the RILs plus Bay-0 and Sha controls were grown sequentially, one complete replication at a time.  For each biological replicate, multiple plants (~5) per genotype were grown in a growth chamber under short day conditions (8 hr light at 100-120 microEinsteins, 20 degrees C day/20 degrees C night) to maintain plants in the vegetative phase for six weeks.  The growth chambers used a combination of metal halide, mercury vapor, and incandescent lamps.  Plants were watered with half-strength Hoaglands solution. SA and/or Silwet treatment: Six-week-old plants were sprayed with 0.30 mM SA (salicylic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)  in 0.02% Silwet L77 to run-off, and control plants were sprayed with 0.02% Silwet L77, a surfactant (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX, USA), alone.   Vegetative leaves from 3 plants per genotype/treatment combination were bulk harvested 28 hours post-treatment, and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extractions.  To avoid diurnal variation in gene expression, the biological replicates were always treated at the same time of day, and harvested at 1:00 p.m.  ONLY THE SILWET TREATED CONTROL SAMPLES ARE INCLUDED IN THIS SUBMISSION.	RNA was extracted from the bulked plants using TRIzol as per the manufacturers protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by purification on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).	cDNA and labeled cRNA were prepared according to the manufacturers guidelines in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual 701021 rev5 (Affymetrix; Santa Clara; CA; USA). The cDNA synthesis was initiated with 5 micrograms total RNA; one-cycle cDNA synthesis and cRNA labeling were performed with kits purchased from Affymetrix.
