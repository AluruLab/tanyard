Due to limitations in growth chamber space,  two biological replications of the RILs plus Bay-0 and Sha controls were grown sequentially, one complete replication at a time.  For each biological replicate, multiple plants (~5) per genotype were grown in a growth chamber under short day conditions (8 hr light at 100-120 microEinsteins, 20 degrees C day\/20 degrees C night) to maintain plants in the vegetative phase for six weeks.  The growth chambers used a combination of metal halide, mercury vapor, and incandescent lamps.  Plants were watered with half-strength Hoagland’s solution. SA and\/or Silwet treatment: Six-week-old plants were sprayed with 0.30 mM SA (salicylic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)  in 0.02% Silwet L77 to run-off, and control plants were sprayed with 0.02% Silwet L77, a surfactant (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX, USA), alone.   Vegetative leaves from 3 plants per genotype\/treatment combination were bulk harvested 28 hours post-treatment, and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extractions.  To avoid diurnal variation in gene expression, the biological replicates were always treated at the same time of day, and harvested at 1:00 p.m.  ONLY THE SILWET TREATED CONTROL SAMPLES ARE INCLUDED IN THIS SUBMISSION."],"type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":92309,"accession":"P-TABM-hans18","name":"P-TABM-hans18","text":["Seeds of  Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Bay-0; Sha; and Bay-0 x Sha RILs originally developed by O.
