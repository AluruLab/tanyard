The camta1 showed stunted primary root growth under osmotic stress. The expression analysis revealed drought recovery as major indicative pathway along with membrane and chloroplast related protein in  camta1 under drought stress. Large number of positively regulated genes were related to osmotic balance, transporters, AP2 and ABA. We used Affymetrix expression analysis to validate the role of CAMTA1 under drought stress. The RNA of Col-0 and camta1 mutant were isolated in water and drought condition.The ATH1 gene chip was used for expression analysis."}],"provider":[{"contact":"samir v sawant","role":"submitter","email":"samirsawant@nbri.res.in"},{"contact":"Poonam Pant","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Neha Pandey","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Alok Ranjan","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Samir V Sawant","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23547968,"authors":"Pandey N, Ranjan A, Pant P, Tripathi RK, Ateek F, Pandey HP, Patre UV, Sawant SV","title":"CAMTA 1 regulates drought responses in Arabidopsis thaliana"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["camta1-3 mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf","root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["camta1-3 mutant","wild type"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["control","drought"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["leaf","root"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":24,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1136026,"accession":"P-GSE40061-4"},{"id":1136025,"accession":"P-GSE40061-3"},{"id":1136027,"accession":"P-GSE40061-2"},{"id":1136020,"accession":"P-GSE40061-1"},{"id":1136021,"accession":"P-GSE40061-8"},{"id":1136022,"accession":"P-GSE40061-7"},{"id":1136023,"accession":"P-GSE40061-6"},{"id":1136024,"accession":"P-GSE40061-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":24,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":24,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":24,"isderived":0}]}]}}
