During the infection process, the released chitin fragments (such as chitooctaose) from fungal cell walls by plant enzymes can trigger plant defense response and gene activation. The current work studies the regulation of Arabidopsis genes by the purified chitin fragment chitooctaose. We used the Affymetric Arabidopsis whole gene arrays to study the gene expression caused by chitin (chitooctaose). Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis seedlings grown hydroponically for 14 days were treated with the purified chitin fragment chitooctaose at a final concentration of 1 um for 3 minutes. The controls were similarli treated with an equivalent amount of ddH2O. Three biological replicates were obtained."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Gary Stacey","role":"submitter","email":"staceyg@missouri.edu"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":[14]},{"category":"BioSourceType","value":["frozen_sample"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"TimeUnit","value":["days"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"Compound","value":["chitooctaose","none"]},{"name":"Dose","value":["1 mM","Unspecified"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":60063,"accession":"P-G4746-4"},{"id":60065,"accession":"P-G4746-3"},{"id":60067,"accession":"P-G4746-2"},{"id":60066,"accession":"P-G4746-1"},{"id":60064,"accession":"P-G4746-7"},{"id":60062,"accession":"P-G4746-6"},{"id":60061,"accession":"P-G4746-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
