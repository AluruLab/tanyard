Experiment Description	Chitin, a polymer of N-acetyl-glucosamne, is a component of the cell walls of many plant fungal pathogens. During the infection process, the released chitin fragments (such as chitooctaose) from fungal cell walls by plant enzymes can trigger plant defense response and gene activation. The current work studies the regulation of Arabidopsis genes by the purified chitin fragment chitooctaose. We used the Affymetric Arabidopsis whole gene arrays to study the gene expression caused by chitin (chitooctaose). Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis seedlings grown hydroponically for 14 days were treated with the purified chitin fragment chitooctaose at a final concentration of 1 um for 3 minutes. The controls were similarli treated with an equivalent amount of ddH2O. Three biological replicates were obtained.

Protocol Description	2-week-old seedlings were treated with 20 ul ddH2O for 30 minutes, with gentle shaking.	2-week-old seedlings were treated with 20 ul 0.5 mM chitooctaose (with a final concentration of 1 uM) for 30 minutes, with gentle shaking.	Seedlings (~ 30 seeds at the beginning) were grown hydroponically in a 50-ml falcon tube containing 10 ml of liquid medium (1X Murashige and  skoog basal salt mixture + 2% dextrose, pH 5.8). The tube was incubated with gentle shaking in a growth chamber  with the following settings: constant light at 125 umol m-2 s-1 at a temperature of 23 C.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 7 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 20 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome Array ATH1. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.
