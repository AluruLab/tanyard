Publication Title	Genome-Wide Analysis of Hydrogen Peroxide-Regulated Gene Expression in Arabidopsis Reveals a High Light-Induced Transcriptional Cluster Involved in Anthocyanin Biosynthesis

Experiment Description	In plants, reactive oxygen species and, more particularly, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) play a dual role as toxic by-products of normal cell metabolism and as regulatory molecules in stress perception and signal transduction. Peroxisomal catalases are an important sink for photorespiratory H2O2. Using ATH1 Affymetrix microarrays, expression profiles were compared between control and catalase-deficient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Reduced catalase levels already provoked differences in nuclear gene expression under ambient growth conditions, and these effects were amplified by high light exposure in a sun simulator for 3 and 8 h. This genome-wide expression analysis allowed us to reveal the expression characteristics of complete pathways and functional categories during H2O2 stress. In total, 349 transcripts were significantly up-regulated by high light in catalase-deficient plants and 88 were down-regulated. From this data set, H2O2 was inferred to play a key role in the transcriptional up-regulation of small heat shock proteins during high light stress. In addition, several transcription factors and candidate regulatory genes involved in H2O2 transcriptional gene networks were identified. Comparisons with other publicly available transcriptome data sets of abiotically stressed Arabidopsis revealed an important intersection with H2O2-deregulated genes, positioning elevated H2O2 levels as an important signal within abiotic stress-induced gene expression. Finally, analysis of transcriptional changes in a combination of a genetic (catalase deficiency) and an environmental (high light) perturbation identified a transcriptional cluster that was strongly and rapidly induced by high light in control plants, but impaired in catalase-deficient plants. This cluster comprises the complete known anthocyanin regulatory and biosynthetic pathway, together with genes of hitherto unknown function.

Protocol Description	Catalase-deficient (CAT2HP1) and control (PTHW) plants were obtained as described by Vandenabeele et al. (2004):<br> <br> Production of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana with decreased CAT2 levels<br> <br> A 515-bp PCR product of the 5\222; prime coding sequence of CAT2  (5\222;-CGCGGATCCTTAGTATCG-3?; 5?-CGCGGATCCTCCAGTTCTCTTGGATGTGAG-3?) was  inserted as a BamHI fragment into pH35SCATS and selected for inverted  direction by PCR. A PstI fragment was ligated into the PstI-digested  pthw142 vector, a binary vector containing the bialaphos resistance gene  (BAR), which is a resistance gene for transformant selection. Binary  constructs were mobilized into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (pMP90) with  the Escherichia coli helper strain HB101. A. thaliana (L) Heyhn.  Ecotype Col-4 plants were transformed by floral dip (Clough and Bent,  1998). The resulting CAT2HP1 plants contain 20% residual catalase  activity. The control plants, named Pthw plants, result from  transformation of an empty pthw142 vector into Col-4 plants.<br> <br> References:<br> Vandenabeele S, Vanderauwera S, Vuylsteke M, Rombauts S, Langebartels C,  Seidlitz HK, Zabeau M, Van Montagu M, Inzé D, Van Breusegem F (2004).

Plant Physiology  139(2):806-821:<br> :<br> Unless mentioned otherwise, the plants were grown under controlled conditions in phytotron exposure chambers, which had been especially designed for plant stress research (Thiel et al., 1996). The light regime was 12 h/12 h at 100 to 140 umol m-2 s-1, the climate adjusted to a relative humidity of 70 pct, and 22C/18C day/night temperatures.	For high light (HL) treatments, 6-week-old plants were transferred to a sun simulator with identical growth conditions and exposed to continuous HL irradiation (photosynthetically active radiation 400 to 700 nm at approximately 1,600 to 1,800 umol m-2 s-1). Zero, 3, and 8 h after the onset of HL stress, middle-aged leaves of 20 to 30 plants per line were sampled and pooled for RNA analysis. The two biological repeat experiments were done with a temporal interval of 1 year.	In two independent experiments, RNA was isolated from leaves of 20 to 30 control or catalase-deficient plants with the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). The concentration of total RNA was determined with a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer, and the quality was examined with the RNA 6000 Nano Assay (Agilent Technologies, 2100 Bioanalyzer).
