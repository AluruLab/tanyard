Peroxisomal catalases are an important sink for photorespiratory H2O2. Using ATH1 Affymetrix microarrays, expression profiles were compared between control and catalase-deficient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Reduced catalase levels already provoked differences in nuclear gene expression under ambient growth conditions, and these effects were amplified by high light exposure in a sun simulator for 3 and 8 h. This genome-wide expression analysis allowed us to reveal the expression characteristics of complete pathways and functional categories during H2O2 stress. In total, 349 transcripts were significantly up-regulated by high light in catalase-deficient plants and 88 were down-regulated. From this data set, H2O2 was inferred to play a key role in the transcriptional up-regulation of small heat shock proteins during high light stress. In addition, several transcription factors and candidate regulatory genes involved in H2O2 transcriptional gene networks were identified. Comparisons with other publicly available transcriptome data sets of abiotically stressed Arabidopsis revealed an important intersection with H2O2-deregulated genes, positioning elevated H2O2 levels as an important signal within abiotic stress-induced gene expression. Finally, analysis of transcriptional changes in a combination of a genetic (catalase deficiency) and an environmental (high light) perturbation identified a transcriptional cluster that was strongly and rapidly induced by high light in control plants, but impaired in catalase-deficient plants. This cluster comprises the complete known anthocyanin regulatory and biosynthetic pathway, together with genes of hitherto unknown function."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Steven Vandenabeele","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Stéphane Rombauts","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Paul Van Hummelen","role":"submitter","email":"tom.bogaert@vib.be"},{"contact":"Wilhelm Gruishem","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Sandy Vanderauwera","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Christian Langebartels","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Dirk Inzé","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Frank Van Breusegem","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Philip Zimmermann","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":16183842,"authors":"Sandy Vanderauwera; Philip Zimmermann; Stephane Rombauts; Steven Vandenabeele; Christian Langebartels; Wilhelm Gruishem; Dirk Inze; Frank Van Breusegem","title":"Genome-Wide Analysis of Hydrogen Peroxide-Regulated Gene Expression in Arabidopsis Reveals a High Light-Induced Transcriptional Cluster Involved in Anthocyanin Biosynthesis"},{"accession":26493993,"authors":"Kaurilind E, Xu E, Brosché M.","title":"A genetic framework for H2O2 induced cell death in Arabidopsis thaliana.","doi":"10.1186\/s12864-015-1964-8","issue":"None","pages":837,"year":2015}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":[6]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia-4"]},{"category":"GeneticModification","value":["transformation"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["CAT2HP1","PTHW"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["leaf"]},{"category":"provider","value":["VIB Department of Plant Systems Biology, Ghent University, Belgium"]},{"category":"TimeUnit","value":["weeks"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["CAT2HP1","PTHW"]},{"name":"time","value":["0 h","3 h","8 h"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":243361,"accession":"P-MEXP-10776"},{"id":243365,"accession":"P-MEXP-10784"},{"id":243364,"accession":"P-MEXP-10777"},{"id":143,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4"},{"id":57,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4_450"},{"id":243362,"accession":"P-MEXP-7837"},{"id":13154,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v5"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":243363,"accession":"P-MEXP-10773"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
