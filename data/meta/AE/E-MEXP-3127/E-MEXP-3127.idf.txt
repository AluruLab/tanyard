Protocol Description	RNA of three plant samples was prepared from each of the following tissue types: embryonic callous of wild type cultured in ECIM for 14 days; somatic embryos in SEIM for 2 days, somatic embryos in SEIM for 2 days with 1 ?mol/L NPA added; Three biological replicates of each plant tissue type were carried out and evaluated. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.<br><br><br>(Parameters: Extracted product = genomic_DNA, Amplification = none)	Surface-sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were plated on germination medium , stored for 2-3 days at 4? in the dark to overcome dormancy, and then transferred to a plant growth room (20/18?, 16 h light/8 h dark cycle) for 7 days. Young seedlings were transplanted into vermiculite and grown under the conditions as described above until harvesting of siliques.<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)	Zygotic embryos were collected as explants and cultured in the solid medium with 4.5 ?M 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid to induce primary somatic embryos (PSE). The PSE were transferred into liquid B5 medium containing 9.0 ?M 2, 4-D (embryonic callus-inducing medium, ECIM) and pre-cultured for 14 days to obtain disc-like embryonic calli. Then, embryonic calli were cultured in auxin-free liquid B5 medium (somatic embryo-inducing medium, SEIM). to induce secondary somatic embryos (SSE).  NPA treatment: embryonic callus treated with 10?M N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid in ECIM for 14 days and then in SEIM for 2 days.
