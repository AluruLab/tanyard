Protocol Description	Seeds of pARF7::ARF7:GR (in the nph4-1 arf19-1 mutant background of Col-0 ecotype) were grown vertically on 1xMS media supplemented with 1 % (w/v) PGP-type agarose for five days in controlled environmental conditions of 23C under continuous light.	Plates containing seedlings were transfered into 1x MS medium 	Plates containing seedlings were transfered into 1x MS medium supplemented with 1 µM NAA and 2 µM dexamethasone	Plates containing seedlings were transfered into 1x MS medium supplemented with 1 µM NAA and 10 µM cycloheximide	Plates containing seedlings were transfered into 1x MS medium supplemented with 1 µM NAA, 2 µM dexamethasone and 10 µM cycloheximide	Plates containing seedlings were transfered into 1x MS medium	Plates containing seedlings were transfered into 1x MS medium supplemented with 2 µM dexamethasone	Plates containing seedlings were transfered into 1x MS medium supplemented with 10 µM cycloheximide	Plates containing seedlings were transfered into 1x MS medium supplemented with 2 µM dexamethasone and 10 µM cycloheximide	Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then purified by RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN). RNA was quantifiedu sing a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop). All RNA samples were approximately 1 µg/µl in a total volume of 10 µl	RNA labelling and hybridisation to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays was performed according to manufacturers recommended protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)	P-AFFY-3	P-AFFY-6
