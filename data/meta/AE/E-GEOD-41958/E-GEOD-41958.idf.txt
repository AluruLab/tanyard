Comment[Submitted Name]	NO-deficient vs wild type Col-0 Arabidopsis seedlings
Experiment Description	Nitric oxide regulates plant development and responses to stress. However, the mechanisms underlying its regulatory role are still poorly known, and the impact of endogenous NO on the genome-wide transcriptome of plants has not been studied. For that purpose, we compared the transcriptomes of NO-deficient nia1nia2, noa1-2 and nia1nia2noa1-2 mutant versus wild type Arabidopsis thaliana plants. A core comprising 66 NO-responsive genes with similar expression in all NO-deficient genotypes was identified. Among them, 46 were down- and 20 up-regulated in NO-deficient plants, and thus positively and negatively regulated by endogenous NO, respectively. Accordingly with changes in its transcriptome, the NO-deficient nia1nia2noa1-2 mutant accumulated anthocyanins and indolic glucosinolates, displayed abnormal iron homeostasis in shoots and roots, and also showed altered root sensitivity to hormones such as ABA, ET, CYK and IAA. Together the presented data suggest NO functions essentially as a modulator of hormone action. Compared analysis of the transcriptomes of 15-day old seedlings from 3 different nitric oxide (NO)-deficient mutant genotypes versus wild type background Col-0 (3 independent biological replicates per genotype). NO-deficient mutant seedlings in Col-0 background were the double nia1nia2 mutant in nitrate reductases (NR/NIA) 1 and 2 (abbreviated as nia); the noa1-2 mutant allele in Nitric Oxide Associated 1 (AtNOA1) (abbreviated as noa); and, the triple nia1nia2noa1-2 (abreviated as nino).

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = normalized signal	Three biological replicates and their corresponding negative controls were independently hybridized to ATH1 microarrays (Affymetrix), containing 22 500 transcript variants from 24 000 well-characterized Arabidopsis genes. Each sample was added to a hybridization solution containing 100 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, 1 M Na+, and 20 mM of EDTA in the presence of 0.01% Tween-20. Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 45°C.	MS media plus 1 % sucrose, 15 days	Linear model methods (LiMMA) were used for determining differentially expressed genes. To control the false-discovery rate, P-values were corrected using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). Criteria for selection of genes were fold value >1.9 and false-discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05. Statistical analysis and graphical visualization of data were performed with the interactive tool fiesta (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/FIESTA/).	Each microarray was washed and stained with streptavidinâ€“phycoerythrin in a Fluidics station 450 (Affymetrix) and scanned at 2.5-Î¼m resolution in a GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G system (Affymetrix). Data analyses were performed using genechip operating software (GCOS), to generate the corresponding CEL files.	Samples were harvested 5 h after dawn of day 15 after sowing and seedlings were grown under long days (16 h light / 8 h darkness) photoperiodic conditions.	Total RNA from wild type and NO-deficient plants was isolated and purified by the Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification System from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).	RNAs were ligated to an RNA oligonucleotide adaptor (Invitrogen) using T4 RNA ligase (Ambion, http://www.ambion.com/). The RNAs were extracted once with phenol-chloroform and non-ligated adapter was removed by chromatography with MicroSpin S-300 HR columns (GE Healthcare, http://www.gehealthcare.com/). Purified ligation products were precipitated in ethanol and used as templates for reverse transcription with Superscript III (Invitrogen) for 3 h at 46°C, using oligonucleotide oligo(dT) as primer. Template RNA was removed by alkaline hydrolysis and first-strand cDNA purified with S.N.A.P. columns (Invitrogen). Second-strand synthesis was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Roche, http://www.roche.com/) for 5 min at 94°C, 5 min; 58°C, 1 min; 72°C, 10 min. A forward oligonucleotide T7-Adap primer, which was complementary to the RNA adapter and contained the sequence of bacteriophage T7 promoter, was used. Double-stranded cDNA was then purified with MinElute columns (Qiagen) and in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase, using a MessageAmp aRNA kit (Ambion). Amplified RNA was treated with DNase I (Roche) to remove cDNA templates, purified with an aRNA Purification Module (Ambion) and then used as template for single-stranded cDNA synthesis, according to Affymetrix instructions (http://www.affymetrix.com/) as dolows: aRNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 42°C with oligo(dT) as primer. After alkaline hydrolysis of aRNA and purification (MinElute columns, Qiagen), cDNA was fragmented with 1.5 units of DNase I (GE Healthcare) into fragments in the 50â€“200 bp range. Finally, 3' ends of fragmented cDNA were biotin-ddUTP labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Promega, http://www.promega.com/) and GeneChip DNA labeling reagent (Affymetrix).
