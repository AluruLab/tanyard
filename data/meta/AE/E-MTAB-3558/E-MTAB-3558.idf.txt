Experiment Description	SWP73 subunits of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) are involved in key developmental pathways in Arabidopsis. We found, using microarray that inactivation of SWP73B caused altered expression of genes belonging to various regulatory pathways, including leaf and flower development. On the basis of this experiment and our other data we concluded that SWP73B modulates major developmental pathways.

Protocol Description	Plants were frozen in LN immediately after harvesting and ground into a fine powder.	Plants were grown under long-day (LD) or short-day (SD) conditions (16h light/8h dark or 8h light/16h dark, respectively) at 22/19°C, 70% humidity.	RNA was extracted using RNeasy plant kit (Qiagen) and 150ng of total RNA were used to further analysis.	Nucleic acids were labeled by biotin-labeling with the IVT labeling kit (GeneChip 3'IVT Express; Affymetrix)	The labeled nucleic acids were hybridised to array for 16h as recommended by the supplier (Gene expression analysis manual; Affymetrix).	The data normalisation (RMA- summarisation method) was done using GeneSpring GX software according to guided workflow.
