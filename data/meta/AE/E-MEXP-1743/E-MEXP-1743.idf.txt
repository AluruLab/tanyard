Experiment Description	Wild-type and exo mutant (SALK_098602) were grown in parallel in three independent experiments in a greenhouse. 3 x 2 profiles were established.

Protocol Description	"Seed material for growth experiments was derived from plants grown in parallel under identical conditions. Plants were established in soil (type Â‘GS-90 EinheitserdeÂ’, GebrÃ¼der Patzer, Germany). Firstly, seeds were allowed to germinate and grow for two weeks in controlled growth chambers (7 days: 16 h light [140 Âµmol m-2 s-1], 20Â°C, 75 % relative humidity/8-h night, 6Â°C, 75 % relative humidity; thereafter 7 days: 8 h light [140 Âµmol m-2 s-1], 20Â°C, 60% relative humidity/16-h night, 16Â°C, 75% relative humidty). Subsequently, plants were transferred to long-day conditions in a greenhouse with artificial light (16 h light [high pressure sodium and metal halide lamps], 21Â°C, 50 % relative humidity/8 h night, 19Â°C, 50 % relative humidity). Both genotypes were grown in the same chamber at the same time in a randomized manner. <br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)"	"Trizol (Invitrogen) standard RNA extraction <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"	Wild-type and exo plants were grown in a randomized manner in a greenhouse. Above ground organs of 15 plants per genotype were harvested for preparation of one RNA sample.	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
