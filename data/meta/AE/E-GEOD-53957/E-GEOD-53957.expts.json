Here the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to E-2-hexenal, one of the green leaf volatiles that are produced upon wounding, herbivory or infection with pathogens is studied. We have taken a transcriptomics approach to identify genes that are induced by E-2-hexenal but not by defense hormones. In three independent biological experiments, Arabidopsis plants, ecotype Columbia (Col-0), were exposed either to 3 ÂµM aerial E-2-hexenal or to the carrier MeOH for the mock treatment and rosette leaves were harvested after 1h, 3h and 24h."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Han Rauwerda","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Alessandra Scala","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Michel A Haring","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Han Rauwerda","role":"submitter","email":"j.rauwerda@uva.nl"},{"contact":"Rossana Mirabella","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Robert C Schuurink","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Timo M Breit","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":26243404,"authors":"Mirabella R, Rauwerda H, Allmann S, Scala A, Spyropoulou EA, de Vries M, Boersma MR, Breit TM, Haring MA, Schuurink RC","title":"WRKY40 and WRKY6 act downstream of the green leaf volatile E-2-hexenal in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1111\/tpj.12953"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["19 to 21 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["rosette leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["2-hexenal","mock"]},{"name":"time","value":["1 hour","24 hour","3 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1169275,"accession":"P-GSE53957-2"},{"id":1169269,"accession":"P-GSE53957-1"},{"id":1169274,"accession":"P-GSE53957-4"},{"id":1169273,"accession":"P-GSE53957-3"},{"id":1169271,"accession":"P-GSE53957-6"},{"id":1169272,"accession":"P-GSE53957-5"},{"id":1169270,"accession":"P-GSE53957-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0}]}]}}
