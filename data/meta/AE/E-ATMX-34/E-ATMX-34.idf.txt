Protocol Description	"Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Col-0 plants were grown on Metro-Mix 360 (SunGro) at 20°C in a Percival reach-in chamber (Series 101 without humidity controls) with a 8/16-h light/dark cycle under a light intensity of 17,000 Lux. For microarray experiments, plants with 16-18 true leaves were co-inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain A208::pTiC58-BI) transformed with pNSB1090 or pNSB1091, which contain T-DNAs with partial tandem copies of wild type CaLCuV A and B components, respectively (Egelkrout et al., 2002). The Agrobacterium transformants were inoculated from glycerol stocks (20 µl) and grown individually to saturation in Luria broth (LB) supplemented with 75 mg/mL spectinomycin at 28ºC overnight and then mixed 1:1. A drop of the mixed culture was deposited directly onto a wounded area generated by puncturing the rosette center 10 times with a 25 gauge needle. The meristematic region was avoided during the wounding process. Control plants were mock-inoculated using the same Agrobacterium strain transformed with pNSB690, which contains a 35S promoter uidA expression cassette. Typically, 12 plants were inoculated with CaLCuV while 6 were mock inoculated per tray. The tray was covered with a clear plastic lid for 4 days and then uncovered for the remainder of the growth period. Symptoms were monitored from the first day post-inoculation (dpi) until the CaLCuV-infected plants were dead at 6 weeks post infection.

"	"Leaves 7-9 at 12 days post-inoculation were harvested, pooled, flash frozen, ground in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80ºC. Three biological replicas corresponding to infected and mock-inoculated samples were collected and processed independently. Each replica contains 6 plants for mock-inoculated samples and 12 for virus-inoculated samples."	Total RNA was extracted from each sample using the Plant RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).
