For microarray experiments, plants with 16-18 true leaves were co-inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain A208::pTiC58-BI) transformed with pNSB1090 or pNSB1091, which contain T-DNAs with partial tandem copies of wild type CaLCuV A and B components, respectively (Egelkrout et al., 2002). The Agrobacterium transformants were inoculated from glycerol stocks (20 µl) and grown individually to saturation in Luria broth (LB) supplemented with 75 mg\/mL spectinomycin at 28ºC overnight and then mixed 1:1. A drop of the mixed culture was deposited directly onto a wounded area generated by puncturing the rosette center 10 times with a 25 gauge needle. The meristematic region was avoided during the wounding process. Control plants were mock-inoculated using the same Agrobacterium strain transformed with pNSB690, which contains a 35S promoter uidA expression cassette. Typically, 12 plants were inoculated with CaLCuV while 6 were mock inoculated per tray. The tray was covered with a clear plastic lid for 4 days and then uncovered for the remainder of the growth period. Symptoms were monitored from the first day post-inoculation (dpi) until the CaLCuV-infected plants were dead at 6 weeks post infection.
