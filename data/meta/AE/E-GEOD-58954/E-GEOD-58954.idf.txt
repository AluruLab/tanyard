Investigation Title	Expression profiling of Col-0 treated with Psm:AvrRpt2						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression profiling of Col-0 treated with Psm:AvrRpt2						
Experiment Description	Identification of AvrRpt2-mediated differential gene expression in Arabidopsis Four-week-old leaves of Arabidopsis Col-0 plant were infiltrated with Pseudomonas syringae pv. Maculicola carring effector AvrRpt2 at OD0.01. Samples were collected at 0 or 6 hours after infiltration. Each time point contains three biological replicates.

Protocol Name	P-GSE58954-1	P-GSE58954-5	P-GSE58954-6	P-GSE58954-2	P-GSE58954-3	P-GSE58954-4	P-GSE58954-7
Protocol Description	The data were normalized with RMA algorithm using Gene-Spring GX default analysis settings ID_REF =  VALUE = Normalized RMA signal value	RNA probes were labelled using MessageAmp Premier RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion)	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of aRNA were hybridized on Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip (Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A) for 16 hours at 45C with rotation at 60rpm.	Mature leaves were infiltrated with Psm carrying AvrRpt2 at OD 0.01 in 10mM MgSO4 solution	Arabidopsis plants (Columbia-0) were grown on soil (Metro Mix 360) at 22˚C under a 12/12 hr light/dark cycle for 4 weeks	The RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Ambion)	Immediately following hybridization, the hybridized probe arrays undergo an automated washing and staining protocol on the GeneChip� FS450 fluidic station and are then scanned on the GeneChip� Scanner 3000 7G Plus where patterns of hybridization are detected.
