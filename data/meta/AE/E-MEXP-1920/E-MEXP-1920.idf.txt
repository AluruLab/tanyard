Experiment Description	This experiment was designed to identify genes expressed preferentially in the two integuments of the Arabidopsis ovule.  Pistils from wild type and two ovule mutants were compared against each aintegumenta-4 (ant-4) which lacks both integuments and inner no outer (ino-1) which lacks the outer integument. Genes that are highly expressed only in the integuments were expected to be reduced in expression in the mutants, as compared with wild type. Pistils containing ovules through all stages of ovule development prior to pollination were pooled for one experiment (FULL arrays), and for two separate experiments, a set of early differentiation stages (EARLY arrays) and a set of later differentiation stages (LATE ARRAYS) were pooled. Wild type and mutant lines are in the ecotype Landsberg erecta.

Protocol Description	Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant kit (Qiagen, USA) using buffer QLT. <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Using affylmGUI, an expression measure was generated from raw CEL files using the rma function. This method uses a multichip linear model and log2 expression values are provided.	All plants were grown in 24 hour light at 19C in Percival growth chambers using 1:1 mixture of Premier Pro-Mix 'BX' potting soil (Premier Horticulture) and vermiculite. Once germinated, plants were fertilized using a complete nutrient solution once per week (Kranz, 1987). Pots containing different genotypes were placed randomly in flats, and rotated between shelves every 3 days. <br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)	Plants were sampled 2-3 days after the start of flowering, for several days, up to 2 weeks.  Pistils were collected during the same time period each day 10am - 1pm.  Pistils were dissected from flowers using needles, frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80C.
