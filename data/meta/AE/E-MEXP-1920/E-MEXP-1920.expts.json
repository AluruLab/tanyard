Pistils from wild type and two ovule mutants were compared against each aintegumenta-4 (ant-4) which lacks both integuments and inner no outer (ino-1) which lacks the outer integument. Genes that are highly expressed only in the integuments were expected to be reduced in expression in the mutants, as compared with wild type. Pistils containing ovules through all stages of ovule development prior to pollination were pooled for one experiment (FULL arrays), and for two separate experiments, a set of early differentiation stages (EARLY arrays) and a set of later differentiation stages (LATE ARRAYS) were pooled. Wild type and mutant lines are in the ecotype Landsberg erecta."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Debra Skinner","role":"submitter","email":"zimskinner@gmail.com"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19291320,"authors":"Skinner DJ, Gasser CS.","title":"Expression-based discovery of candidate ovule development regulators through transcriptional profiling of ovule mutants.","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2229-9-29"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"biosource type","value":["frozen_sample"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["early floral stage 9 to 11","full floral stage 9 to 12","late floral stage 12"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Landsberg erecta"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["ant-4","ino-1","wild type (Ler)"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["pistil"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"developmental stage","value":["early floral stage 9 to 11","full floral stage 9 to 12","late floral stage 12"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["ant-4","ino-1","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":17,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1165841,"accession":"P-MTAB-2394"},{"id":1165842,"accession":"P-MTAB-2396"},{"id":1165839,"accession":"P-MTAB-2395"},{"id":1165840,"accession":"P-MTAB-2397"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":17,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":17,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
