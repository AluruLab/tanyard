Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA normalized	Hybridizations were performed at 45 °C for 16 h, in a rotating platform with 10 µg of biotin-labeled aRNA for total and polysome RNAs and 7-10 µg of biotin-labeled aRNA for IP RNA.	Plants were grown in soil (Sunshine Mix LC1, JM McConkey, Sumner, WA) containing 150 g Osmocote 14-14-14 fertilizer (Scotts catalog #90036) and 75 g Marathon pesticide (Crop production services, Riverside, CA) per 3.8 ft3 of soil in a controlled environmental growth room (16 h at ~100 uE sec-1m-2 light: 8 h dark at 23C).	R/Bioconductor (v. 2.12.0), RMA normalization	GeneChips were scanned by use of the Affymetrix GeneChip Workstation Scanner 3000.	25-d-old plants grown in 5.08cm square pots were placed in a 4C chamber (16 h, ~ 50 uE sec-1 m-2 light: 8 h dark) for 12 h or in a 23C growth chamber (16 h, ~ 100 uE sec-1 m-2 light: 8 h dark). Cold treatment began 2 h following the initiation of light period (ZT2). Cold-treated or control rosette leaves were collected at specific time points, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen unless otherwise indicated and stored at -80C.	Extraction of polysome by differential centrifugation through sucrose gradients was based on the procedures of Zanetti et al. (2005) and Mustroph et al. (2009); Total RNA and polysomal RNA (â‰¥ 2 ribosomes per mRNA; typically gradient fractions 7 to 13) were extracted by use of TRIzol solution (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Total RNAs were subjected to DNAse treatment by use of RNase-Free DNAse Set (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Total and polysomal RNA were cleaned by use of the RNAeasy Plant mini kit (Qiagen). For CSP immunopurification for RNA analyses, rosette leaves of 25-d-old plants were collected and cross-linked with formaldehyde solution (Niranjanakumari et al., 2002). Briefly, leaves were washed with ice-cold ddH2O and cross-linked by bathing in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde (Molecular biology grade, Fisher, Fremont, CA) for 15 min by vacuum infiltration. Cross-linking was stopped by addition of 2 M glycine [pH 7.0] to a final concentration of 125 mM and vacuum-infiltrated for 5 min. Leaves were washed twice with ice-cold ddH2O, ground in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. One mL pulverized frozen plant tissue was thawed in 2 mL extraction buffer, mixed and centrifuged at 16,000 g at 4°C for 15 min to obtain a supernatant and passed through Miracloth. The clarified extracts were added to the antibody-coated Protein A beads (described above) and incubated at 4°C for 2 h with gentle shaking. The supernatant (Unbound fraction) was removed and the beads were washed 4 times by resuspension in 6 mL wash buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl [pH 9.0], 200 mM KCl, 36 mM MgCl2, 25 mM EGTA, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 50 Î¼g/mL cycloheximide, 50 Î¼g/mL chloramphenicol, 1.125 % (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.125 % (v/v) Brij-35, 0.125 % (v/v) Tween-40, 0.125 % (v/v) NP-40) and centrifuged to discard the wash solution. To elute the bound CSP1 and any associated molecules, 150 Î¼L elution buffer (100 mM Tris-HCL [pH 8.0], 25 mM EDTA, 1 % (w/v) SDS) was added to the beads, which were incubated 10 min at room temperature with shaking, and centrifuged to obtain the eluate fraction. Elution were repeated by addition of 150 Î¼L elution buffer following by incubation at 65°C for 10 min. The eluate was combined and 2 Î¼L proteinase K (20 Î¼g/mL) was added, and incubated at 65°C for 1 h to reverse the cross-linking. Immunopurified RNAs were extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol and further purified by use of the RNAeasy plant mini kit column (Qiagen). anti-CSP1 antibody: the rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated against a peptide (C15 AGNGDQRGATKGGN163) specific to *Arabidopsis thaliana *CSP1(At4g36020). The antiserum was subsequently affinity purified using the CSP1 peptide (anti-CSP1, Gencript, Piscataway, NJ)	Amplified RNA (aRNA) synthesis and biotin-labeling was conducted with 150 total or polysomal RNA, or 3-6 ng immunoprecipitated (IP) RNA using GeneChip® 3â€™ IVT expression (Affymetrix)
