Experiment Description	The goal is to compare each mutant (elo2, elo3, drl1-2 and ang4) to the wild-type Ler. The experimental design comprised 3 replicates of each genotype, one replicate corresponding to one RNA extraction on a independent pool of plants.

Protocol Description	The growth chamber conditions were: 16/8 hrs (d/n) with white light (Neon tubes, cool white), 100 ÂµEm-Â²h-1 PAR and 20 Â°C.  60 seeds were sowed in per 150 x 25 mm round dish, sealed with Urgopore tape and placed in darkness at 4oC for 3 days.	Plants of the wild-type Landsberg erecta Ler and 4 narrow leaf mutants elongata2, elongata3, elongata4, angusta4 (Berna et al., 1999) and drl1-2 (Nelissen et al., 2003)(Nottingham Seed Stock Center (NASC) code is N9360).  The shoot apex of plants (comprising shoot apex meristem, first and second leaf primordia at petiole-less stage) were harvested at the growth stage 1.0 removing the cotyledons and the hypocotyls and at least 4 hours after the beginning of the photoperiod when photosynthetic and metabolic activities of plants are stable (Boyes et al., 2001). The age of the plants at the harvesting step were between 11 and 18 days after sowing depending of the delay in mutant development. 	The experimental design comprised 3 replicates of each genotype, one replicate corresponding to one RNA extraction on a independent pool of about 150 plant apex. 	Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies Gaithersburg MD, USA)	Affymetrix  Labelling protocol for ARE-ATH1 array  The labelling protocol is applicable for use with the GeneChip ARE-ATH1 when starting with a minimal amount of 5ug total RNA.
