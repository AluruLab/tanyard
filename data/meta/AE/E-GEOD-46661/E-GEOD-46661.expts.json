What's more, in the overexpression plants, the endogenesis ABA contents were higher than WT. We found there existed an interaction between bHLH122 and CYP707A3 by virtue of EMSA and ChIP assays. We wanted to learn more about the molecular mechanism of bHLH122 and to explore what had changed in the over-expression plant through Genechips. Two independent overexpression bHLH122 lines and WT Arabidopsis were chosen to  RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The plants were sowed on MS  medium after 96 h stratification,then transferred into soil after one weeks. After 2 weeks, collected the shoot above the soil and extracted RNA, digested by DNaseâ… and hybrid on Affymetrix microarrays."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Wenxue LI","role":"submitter","email":"mlw0927@126.com"},{"contact":"Wen-xue Li","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"genetic background","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["shoot"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"TREATMENT","value":["bHLH122 overexpression","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":767547,"accession":"P-GSE46661-4"},{"id":767546,"accession":"P-GSE46661-3"},{"id":767545,"accession":"P-GSE46661-2"},{"id":767541,"accession":"P-GSE46661-1"},{"id":767542,"accession":"P-GSE46661-7"},{"id":767543,"accession":"P-GSE46661-6"},{"id":767544,"accession":"P-GSE46661-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0}]}]}}
