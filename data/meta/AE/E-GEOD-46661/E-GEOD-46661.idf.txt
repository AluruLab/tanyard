Investigation Title	Over-expression of bHLH122 in Arabidopsis						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Over-expression of bHLH122 in Arabidopsis
Experiment Description	bHLH122 could be induced by salt, osmotic and drought stress except ABA, the transgentic Arabidopsis were more tolerant to abiotic stresses, such as drought and salt. What's more, in the overexpression plants, the endogenesis ABA contents were higher than WT. We found there existed an interaction between bHLH122 and CYP707A3 by virtue of EMSA and ChIP assays. We wanted to learn more about the molecular mechanism of bHLH122 and to explore what had changed in the over-expression plant through Genechips. Two independent overexpression bHLH122 lines and WT Arabidopsis were chosen to  RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The plants were sowed on MS  medium after 96 h stratification,then transferred into soil after one weeks. After 2 weeks, collected the shoot above the soil and extracted RNA, digested by DNaseâ… and hybrid on Affymetrix microarrays.

Protocol Description	Microarray analysis was performed as described by Breitling et al (2004). Two biological replicates were used for each genotype. We normalized expression profiles with the RMA method (Irizarry et al, 2003).A list of genes with statistically significant changes in expression between the genotypes was generated by the RankProd method in which multiple testing was taken into account by the use of pfp (percentage of false prediction) (pfp < 0.05) (Gentleman et al., 2004;Hong et al., 2006) ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA signal	Total RNA were amplified, labeled and purified by using GeneChip 3â€™IVT Express Kit (Cat#901229, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) followed the manufacturerâ€™s instructions to obtain biotin labeled cRNA.	Array hybridization and wash was performed using GeneChip® Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit (Cat#900720, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US)in Hybridization Oven 645 (Cat#00-0331-220V, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US)and Fluidics Station 450 (Cat#00-0079, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) followed the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.	There were three independent lines, two were overexpression bHLH122 and one was wild type. The plants were sowed on MS medium after 96 h stratification,then transferred into soil after one weeks. After 2 weeks, collected the shoot above the soil and extracted RNA, digested by DNaseâ… and hybrid on Affymetrix microarrays.	The plants were sowed on MS medium after 96 h stratification,then transferred into soil after one weeks. After 2 weeks, collected the shoot above the soil and extracted RNA, digested by DNaseâ… and hybrid on Affymetrix microarrays.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and digested DNA with DNase â… .	Slides were scanned by GeneChip® Scanner 3000 (Cat#00-00212, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) and Command Console Software 3.1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) with default settings.
