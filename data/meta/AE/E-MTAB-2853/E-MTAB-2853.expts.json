In order to understand the molecular mode of WOX5 action the genes differentially expressed by WOX5 inducible over-expression were determined by analysis of microarray hybridizations. Seedlings transformed with a dexamethasone inducible WOX5 construct were induced for one or four hours with dexamethasone or a mock solution. Other seedlings were treated one hour with cycloheximide ( a protein synthesis inhibitor to reduce secondary transcriptional effects after WOX5 activation) and either dexamethasone or a mock solution. Root tips were harvested, RNA extracted, and the RNA samples prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays. Potential target genes of WOX5 were further analyzed by transcriptional markers, qPCR and EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Thomas Laux","role":"investigator","email":"laux@biologie.uni-freiburg.de"},{"contact":"Edwin P Groot","role":"data analyst;submitter","email":"edwin.groot@biologie.uni-freiburg.de"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":26028217,"authors":"Pi L , Aichinger E , van der Graaff E , Llavata-Peris CI , Weijers D , Hennig L , Groot E , Laux T","title":"Organizer-Derived WOX5 Signal Maintains Root Columella Stem Cells through Chromatin-Mediated Repression of CDF4 Expression","doi":"10.1016\/j.devcel.2015.04.024"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["35S::WOX5-GR"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root tip"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["Cycloheximide and Dexamethasone","Cycloheximide andmock solution","Dexamethasone","mock solution"]},{"name":"phenotype","value":["Cycloheximide treated and induced expression of WOX5","Cycloheximide treated but no induced expression of WOX5","Dexamethasone-induced expression of WOX5","no induced expression of WOX5"]},{"name":"time","value":["1 hour","4 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1222145,"accession":"P-MTAB-40710"},{"id":1222147,"accession":"P-MTAB-50288"},{"id":1222148,"accession":"P-MTAB-40708"},{"id":1222146,"accession":"P-MTAB-40709"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
