Experiment Description	WOX5 maintains columella stem cells in the Arabidopsis root and prevents their differentiation. In order to understand the molecular mode of WOX5 action the genes differentially expressed by WOX5 inducible over-expression were determined by analysis of microarray hybridizations. Seedlings transformed with a dexamethasone inducible WOX5 construct were induced for one or four hours with dexamethasone or a mock solution. Other seedlings were treated one hour with cycloheximide ( a protein synthesis inhibitor to reduce secondary transcriptional effects after WOX5 activation) and either dexamethasone or a mock solution. Root tips were harvested, RNA extracted, and the RNA samples prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays. Potential target genes of WOX5 were further analyzed by transcriptional markers, qPCR and EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay).

Protocol Description	Labeled cRNA was hybridized according to Hennig et al. 2003, Plant Mol Biol 53, 457-465.	Seed was germinated on vertically oriented agar plates containing half-strength Murashige-Skoog salts. After 6 days of growth under continuous illumination at 18 degrees Celsius, the seedlings were treated for the indicated time periods using the indicated chemicals. After treatment, 5 mm of the root tips were harvested and immediately subjected to the RNA extraction protocol.	RNA extracted according to Hennig et al. 2003, Plant Mol Biol 53, 457-465.	cRNA was labeled according to Hennig et al. 2003, Plant Mol Biol 53, 457-465.
