Comment[Submitted Name]	Respiratory burst oxidase homologues D and F in catalase2 deficient plants
Experiment Description	Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can act as a signaling molecule that influences various aspects of plant growth and development, including stress signaling and cell death. Catalase deficient plants are pioneering systems which accumulate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from peroxisomal origin during photorespiratory challenges. Respiratory burst oxidase homologues D and F are known to participate in intracellular oxidative stress response launched in cat2 mutants (Chaouch et al., 2012). We studied the compared the transcriptional response of cat2 rbohD and cat2 rbohF double mutants versus the cat2 background to further adress their role during photorespiratory stress. After 3 weeks of growth, leaf tissue from the three different genotypes was harvested in triplicate.

Protocol Description	Normalised using GCRMA ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 GC-RMA signal	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 microg total RNA.	Following fragmentation, 10 microg of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C and at 60 rounds/min. The GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400 and 450.	After 3 weeks of growth in mild photorespiratory-promoting conditions, leaf tissue from the three different genotypes was harvested in triplicate. Design: 3 replicates x 3 genotypes (cat2, cat2 rbohD and cat2 rbohF)	Plants were grown in air from seeds under a 16 h/8 h day/night regime, relative humidity was 65%, and an irradiance of 200 Î¼molÂ·m-2Â·s-1 was used to drive oxidative stress in the cat2 background plants. Arabidopsis Col-0, cat2, cat2 rbohD and cat2 rbohF were 3 week old before sampling.	Three biological replicates were generated each consisting of a pool of leaves from at least 8 plants. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, USA).	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.
