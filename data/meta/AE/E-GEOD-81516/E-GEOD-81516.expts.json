Catalase deficient plants are pioneering systems which accumulate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from peroxisomal origin during photorespiratory challenges. Respiratory burst oxidase homologues D and F are known to participate in intracellular oxidative stress response launched in cat2 mutants (Chaouch et al., 2012). We studied the compared the transcriptional response of cat2 rbohD and cat2 rbohF double mutants versus the cat2 background to further adress their role during photorespiratory stress. After 3 weeks of growth, leaf tissue from the three different genotypes was harvested in triplicate."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Patrick Willems","role":"submitter","email":"pawil@psb.ugent.be"},{"contact":"Graham Noctor","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Frank Van Breusegem","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Patrick Willems","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Amna Mhamdi","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":27246095,"authors":"Willems P, Mhamdi A, Simon S, Storme V, Kerchev PI, Noctor G, Gevaert K, Van Breusegem F","title":"The ROS Wheel: refining ROS transcriptional footprints in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1104\/pp.16.00420"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["3 weeks"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["cat2","cat2 rbohD","cat2 rbohF"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["cat2","cat2 rbohD","cat2 rbohF"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1205383,"accession":"P-GSE81516-4"},{"id":1205382,"accession":"P-GSE81516-3"},{"id":1205379,"accession":"P-GSE81516-6"},{"id":1205380,"accession":"P-GSE81516-5"},{"id":1205381,"accession":"P-GSE81516-2"},{"id":1205377,"accession":"P-GSE81516-1"},{"id":1205378,"accession":"P-GSE81516-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
