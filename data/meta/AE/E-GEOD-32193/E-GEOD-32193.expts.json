The Arabidopsis transcription factors ARF6 (Auxin Response Factor 6) and ARF8 regulate all of these processes, in part by activating jasmonate biosynthesis.  Jasmonates in turn activate genes encoding the transcription factors MYB21 and MYB24, which mediate a subset of the processes controlled by ARF6 and ARF8.  This experiment was designed to characterize gene expression in flowers before and after they open, and to determine how arf6 arf8 and myb21 myb24 mutation combinations affect these gene expression patterns. Three biological replicates were prepared at each of two developmental stages, stage 12 (oldest closed buds) and stage 13 (youngest open flowers), for three genotypes (Wild type, arf6-2 arf8-3, and myb21-5 myb24-5).  For the mutant genotypes, stage 13 flowers do not actually open, so corresponding flowers of equivalent age were chosen based on the position of open flowers in wild-type inflorescences."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Sara E Ploense","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Punita Nagpal","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jason Reed","role":"submitter","email":"jreed@email.unc.edu"},{"contact":"Jason W Reed","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":22346763,"authors":"Reeves PH, Ellis CM, Ploense SE, Wu MF, Yadav V, Tholl D, Ch√©telat A, Haupt I, Kennerley BJ, Hodgens C, Farmer EE, Nagpal P, Reed JW","title":"A regulatory network for coordinated flower maturation","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.1002506"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["flowering stage","petal differentiation and expansion stage"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia ecotype"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["arf6-2, arf8-3 double mutant","myb21-5, myb24-5 double mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["flower","flower bud"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"developmental stage","value":["flowering stage","petal differentiation and expansion stage"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["arf6-2, arf8-3 double mutant","myb21-5, myb24-5 double mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1168062,"accession":"P-GSE32193-6"},{"id":1168063,"accession":"P-GSE32193-7"},{"id":1168065,"accession":"P-GSE32193-4"},{"id":1168064,"accession":"P-GSE32193-5"},{"id":1168067,"accession":"P-GSE32193-2"},{"id":1168066,"accession":"P-GSE32193-3"},{"id":1168061,"accession":"P-GSE32193-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0}]}]}}
