RNA extractions from the two tissues were hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis microarrays. The two tissues were the radicle and the micropylar endosperm cap that covers it. The interaction of these two tissues is thought to control the timing of germination though alterations in the extensibility of the radicle and the physical resistance of the micropylar endosperm cap to radicle penetration. Only seeds without endosperm rupture were sampled."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Gerhard Leubner","role":"submitter","email":"gerhard.leubner@rhul.ac.uk"}],"bibliography":[{"authors":"Antje Voegele, Tina Steinbrecher, Anita Kleiber, Danu코e Tarkowsk치, Terezie Urbanov치, Veronika Ture?kov치, Karin Weitbrecht, Kai Graeber, Miroslav Strnad and Gerhard Leubner-Metzger","title":"The Molecular Biomechanics of the Micropylar Endosperm as a Major Mediator of the Germination Responses of Lepidium sativum Seeds to Sub- and Supra-Optimal Temperatures","status":"completed manuscript"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seed"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Lepidium sativum"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["micropylar endosperm","radicle"]},{"category":"provider","value":["Juliwa, Heidelberg, Germany"]},{"category":"specimen with known storage state","value":["fresh_sample"]},{"category":"temperature","value":["11 degree celsius","18 degree celsius","27 degree celsius","32 degree celsius"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"organism part","value":["micropylar endosperm","radicle"]},{"name":"temperature","value":["11 degree celsius","18 degree celsius","27 degree celsius","32 degree celsius"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":32,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":812761,"accession":"P-MTAB-34009"},{"id":812763,"accession":"P-MTAB-34008"},{"id":812762,"accession":"P-MTAB-34006"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":812764,"accession":"P-MTAB-34007"},{"id":90533,"accession":"P-AFFY-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":32,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":32,"isderived":0}]}]}}
