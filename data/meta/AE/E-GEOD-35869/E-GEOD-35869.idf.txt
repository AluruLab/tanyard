Investigation Title	Gene expression from cadmium treated Arabidopsis seedlings							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Gene expression from cadmium treated Arabidopsis seedlings
Experiment Description	To identify genes that are up-regulated by Cd for creation of a Cd-inducible reporter line. See PMID 22283708. One week old Col-0 plants were treated with/without 200uM Cd for 6 hours. Total RNA was extracted from whole seedlings and subjected to hybridization with Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.
