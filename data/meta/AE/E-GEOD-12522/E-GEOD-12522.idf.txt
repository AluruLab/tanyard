Experiment Description	The development of trichomes (leaf hairs) from pluripotent epidermal cells in Arabidopsis provides a powerful system to investigate the regulatory motifs involved in plant cell differentiation. Genetic studies have revealed that a bHLH transcription factor, GL3, activates downstream genes required for trichome initiation by interacting with a R2R3-MYB protein, GL1. We have taken advantage of several mutants in the trichome developmental pathway and gene expression analyses to identify a set of genes expressed predominantly in Arabidopsis trichomes. Experiment Overall Design: We compared the gene expression between the wild type and trichome mutant, gl3 egl3 using green tissue (not include root).

Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	feature_extraction		
Protocol Description	RNA was extracted with Qiagen RNeasy Plant RNA extraction kit.	Following confirmation of RNA quality, Ovationâ¢ Biotin RNA Amplification and Labeling System (NuGen Technologies, Inc., San Carlos, CA) is used to prepare amplified, biotin-labeled cDNA from total RNA for following manufacturerâs instructions. Briefly, first strand cDNA is synthesized from 25 ng of total RNA using a unique first strand DNA/RNA chimeric primer and reverse transcriptase. Following double strand cDNA generation, amplification of cDNA is achieved by utilizing an isothermal DNA amplification process that involves repeated SPIAâ¢ DNA/RNA primer binding, DNA duplication, strand displacement and RNA cleavage. The amplified SPIAâ¢ cDNA is purified and subjected to a two-step fragmentation and labeling process. The fragmented/biotinylated cDNA content is measured in a ND-1000 spectrophotometer and the quality was analyzed on an RNA 6000 Nano LabChip (Agilent) using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.
