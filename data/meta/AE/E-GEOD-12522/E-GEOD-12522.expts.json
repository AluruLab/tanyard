Genetic studies have revealed that a bHLH transcription factor, GL3, activates downstream genes required for trichome initiation by interacting with a R2R3-MYB protein, GL1. We have taken advantage of several mutants in the trichome developmental pathway and gene expression analyses to identify a set of genes expressed predominantly in Arabidopsis trichomes. Experiment Overall Design: We compared the gene expression between the wild type and trichome mutant, gl3 egl3 using green tissue (not include root)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Kengo Morohashi","role":"submitter","email":"morohashi.1@osu.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19247443,"authors":"Kengo Morohashi, Erich Grotewold","title":"A systems approach reveals regulatory circuitry for Arabidopsis trichome initiation by the GL3 and GL1 selectors.","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.1000396","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["20 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Landsberg erecta"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["gl3, egl3 mutant","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["gl3, egl3 mutant","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":452751,"accession":"P-G12522-1"},{"id":452750,"accession":"P-G12522-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
