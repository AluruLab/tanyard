Comment[Submitted Name]	Influence of human P53 on plant gene expression						
Experiment Description	Mammalian p53 is a super tumor suppressor and plays a key role in guarding genome from DNA damage. However, p53 has not been found in plants which do not bear cancer although they constantly expose to ionizing radiation of ultraviolet light. Here we introduced p53 into the model plant Arabidopsis and examined p53-conferred phenotype in plant. Most strikingly, p53 caused early senescence and fasciation. We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes 10-day-old wild type (Col-0) and 35S:P53-transgenic plants. Replicates are derived from three independent biological experiments.

Protocol Description	The raw data refer to the linear data which has been summarized using a summarization algorithm (RMA16, PLIER 16 and Iterative PLIER 16). All summarization algorithms also do variance stabilization by adding 16.The normalized data are generated after the log transformation and baseline transformation step. ID_REF =  VALUE = normalized	RNA probes were labelled using the Ambion MessageAmp Premier.	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized on Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip (Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A).	10-day-old wild type (Col-0) and 35S:P53-transgenic plants. Replicates are derived from three independent biological experiments.	Arabidopsis seedlings were grown at 21-24 degreeC, 16-hour day length, 60% relative humidity	Total RNA was isolated from the frozen material using Invitrogen TRIzol.	GeneChips were scanned using the Axon Genepix Scanner (Genepix 4000B).
