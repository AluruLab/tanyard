However, p53 has not been found in plants which do not bear cancer although they constantly expose to ionizing radiation of ultraviolet light. Here we introduced p53 into the model plant Arabidopsis and examined p53-conferred phenotype in plant. Most strikingly, p53 caused early senescence and fasciation. We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes 10-day-old wild type (Col-0) and 35S:P53-transgenic plants. Replicates are derived from three independent biological experiments."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Shui Wang","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Shui Wang","role":"submitter","email":"shuiwang@shnu.edu.cn"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":27648563,"authors":"Ma H, Song T, Wang T, Wang S","title":"Influence of Human p53 on Plant Development","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0162840"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["10 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["35S:P53 transgenic","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["35S:P53 transgenic","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1223619,"accession":"P-GSE79678-6"},{"id":1223620,"accession":"P-GSE79678-5"},{"id":1223622,"accession":"P-GSE79678-2"},{"id":1223623,"accession":"P-GSE79678-4"},{"id":1223617,"accession":"P-GSE79678-1"},{"id":1223621,"accession":"P-GSE79678-3"},{"id":1223618,"accession":"P-GSE79678-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
