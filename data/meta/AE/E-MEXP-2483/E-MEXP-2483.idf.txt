Experiment Description	Transcript analysis in the fry1 arabidopsis mutant compared to the pht1;4 (DCJ) control in leaves and roots of the plant. The experiment was duplicated.	
Protocol Name	P-MTAB-9766	P-MTAB-9764	P-MTAB-9765	P-AFFY-2	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4[]	P-AFFY-6	Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat	
Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	grow	specified_biomaterial_action	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	
Protocol Description	Total RNAs from leaves of plants was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated in LiCl. Total RNAs from roots was extracted with the RNeasy plant mini kit (qiagen). RNAs are treated with DNase (DNA-free kit from Ambion). RNAs quality is checked by Agilent Lab-on-chip analysis.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	plants are grown vertically in petri dishes during 10 to 12 days in a growth chamber (temperature : day/night 24/21°C, 16h photoperiod). Duplicates were performed for each genotype (pht1;4 and fry1 mutants). <br>(Parameters: start time = 10, stop time = 12, time unit = days, min temperature = 21, max temperature = 24, temperature unit = C, media = MS/10 500micromolar Pi)	Roots and rosettes of plants were harvested separately, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -45°C before extraction and analysis.
