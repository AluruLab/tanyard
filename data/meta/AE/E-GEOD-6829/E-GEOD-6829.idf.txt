Experiment Description	In our laboratory we are interested in studying the functions of WRKY zinc finger type transcription factors. There are 74 members of this gene family in Arabidopsis. WRKY factors are key regulators of distinct plant defense responses and are involved in certain developmental programs e.g. trichome development and plant leaf senescence. We would like to determine the functions of a small sub-group (group II-a) of WRKY factors in response to bacterial infection. Our aim is to compare and contrast the gene expression profiles of 3-week-old wild type and WRKY T-DNA knockout mutants grown in a growth chamber under long day growth conditions and subsequently challenged for 6 hours with the virulent bacterial pathogen /Pseudomonas syringae/ DC3000.
