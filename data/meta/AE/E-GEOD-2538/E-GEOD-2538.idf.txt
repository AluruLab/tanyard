Experiment Description	Using the ATH1 Affymetrix microarrays consisting of about 23,000 genes, we examined the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to chito-tetramers, chito-octamers and hydrolyzed chitin after 30 min of treatment.

Protocol Description	Growth Conditions and Treatments: Arabidopsis thaliana L. (Columbia-0) seeds were sterilized and grown hydroponically as previously described (Zhang et al., 2002, MPMI 15(9) 963-970). Briefly, Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized and allocated in 50 ml Falcon tubes containing 10 ml of liquid medium (1 X Murashige and Skoog Basal Salt Mixture + 2% Dextrose, pH 5.8). The tubes were incubated with gentle shaking in a growth chamber with the following settings: constant light at 125 Â&#956;mol m-2 sec-1 at a temperature of 23 Â&deg;C. After 14 days, the seedlings were treated with either hydrolyzed crab-shell chitin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) at a final concentration of 100 Â&#956;g/ml or the purified chito-tetramer  (degree of polymerization, d.p. = 4) or octamer (d.p. =8) at a final concentration of 1 Â&#956;M. The control seedlings were similarly treated with an equivalent amount of water. Whole seedlings were collected 30 minutes after treatment, immediately frozen in liquid N2, and stored at â"80 Â&deg;C for later use. Three independent replicates were conducted. RNA and Microarray Methods: Total RNA was extracted from the plants using a modified Trizol method (Chomczynski and Sashi, 1987) (see also Protocols Manual at the AFGC web page http://www.arabidopsis.org/info/2010_projects/comp_proj/AFGC/RevisedAFGC/AFGC_Protocols_Dec_2001L.pdf) and purified with a silica membrane column (Qiagen, RNeasy). Fifteen micrograms biotinylated complementary RNA (cRNA) was prepared and used to hybridize ATH1 Arabidopsis GeneChips (Affymetrix) using the Affymetrix manufacturerâs protocols. The array images were analyzed with the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) 1.1 with the target intensity set to 500. These data were imported into GeneSpring 7.0 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA, USA). To remove chip-to-chip signal variation, each measurement was divided by the 50.0th percentile of all measurements in that sample.  All samples were normalized to the reference data set, consisting of four replicates of Columbia-0, untreated. Each measurement for each gene was divided by the median of that geneâs intensity in the reference data set. The normalized values (Normalized Ratio) are reported along with the intensity values for this array.
