This dataset includes CEL files, RMA signal values and MAS5 P\/M\/A calls from total mRNA populations of plants at 9 to 10 leaf rosette stage. Biological replicates of root and shoot tissues were harvested after 7 h and 24 h of submergence in darkness along with corresponding non-submerged dark controls. To characterize the dark response, non-submerged light controls plants were harvested at the 0 h time point. Quantitative profiling of cellular mRNAs was accomplished with the Affymetrix ATH1 platform. Changes in the transcriptome in response to submergence and early darkness were evaluated, and the data led to identification of genes co-regulated at the conditional and organ-specific level. 20 samples, 5 conditions (7 h submergence in darkness, 7 h darkness, 24 h submergence in darkness, 24 h darkness, 0 h light control), 2 RNA pools (rosette leaf and root tissues), 2 independent biological replicate experiments"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Angelika Mustroph","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Seung Cho Lee","role":"submitter","email":"slee064@ucr.edu"},{"contact":"Julia Bailey-Serres","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Divya Vanashisht","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"L.A.C.J.
