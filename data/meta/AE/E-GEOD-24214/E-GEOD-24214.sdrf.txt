GSM595551 1	"Geminivirus diseases are among the most important economic impact on crops, including beans, cassava, cotton, cucurbits, corn, peppers and tomatoes. Geminiviruses have a genome composed of one or two molecules of single-stranded DNA, depending on mono or bipartite. The BCTV genome consists of a single strand of DNA that contains six reading frames for proteins CP, V2, Rep, C2, Ren, and C4. To determine the mechanism by which C2 of BCTV induce genes, we performed transgenic Arabidopsis expressing BCTV C2.
