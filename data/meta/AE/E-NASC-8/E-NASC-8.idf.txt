Experiment Description	It has been strongly argued that plant cells should have a means of sensing sugars at the cell surface, so that extracellular and intracellular sugars can be sensed separately and their metabolism coordinated (Lalonde et al., Plant Cell, 11, 707-26, 2000). There is good evidence for an intracellular hexokinase-dependent pathway of hexose sensing in plants, but very little evidence for a hexokinase-independent signalling pathway, such as that provided by SNF3 or RGT2 in yeast. Many papers on sugar sensing in plants cite work from two laboratories as evidence for hexokinase-independent hexose signalling in plants. The first is that in which cell-wall invertase and sucrose synthase genes were induced by treatment of a Chenopodium suspension culture with 30 mM 6-Deoxyglucose (6DOG) for 24 h (Roitsch et al., Plant Physiol 108, 285-294, 1995; Godt et al., J. Plant Physiol 146, 231-238, 1995). The second is that in which a patatin transgene in Arabidopsis was shown to be weakly induced by growth over several days on a mixture of 30 mM glucose plus 30 mM 3-O-methylglucose (3OMG), but strongly induced by growth on 30 mM Glc plus 90 mM 3OMG (Martin et al., Plant J, 11, 53-62, 1997). We are not aware of any examples of Arabidopsis genes which respond to 6DOG or 3OMG yet this is an area of wide significance. Identification of such a gene would help to establish if a hexokinase-independent signalling system operates in plants, and would provide a basis for establishment of a genetic screen for mutants, using the gene promoter linked to a reporter such as luciferase. The aim of this proposal is to discover any genes which are either activated or repressed by glucose AND by 3OMG and/or 6DOG, but not by mannitol (an osmotic control). The use of both 3OMG and 6DOG will help to identify non-specific effects of either. All substrates will first be analysed by HPLC to confirm that they are pure. Arabidopsis Col-0 seedlings will be grown in vitro for 7 days in the absence of sugars, then treated with 30 mM glucose or glucose analogue for 8 h (these conditions are based on concentrations and time courses of Roitsch et al.). RNA will then be isolated from multiple independent plates to minimise biological variation.

Protocol: Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol 	RNA samples were quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 100 pmol T7-(dT)24 primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3')  was hybridized with the Total RNA ( 8 - 12ug) at 70ÃÂ°C for 10 minutes.  First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM ÃÂ-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.
