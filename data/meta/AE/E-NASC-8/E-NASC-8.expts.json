There is good evidence for an intracellular hexokinase-dependent pathway of hexose sensing in plants, but very little evidence for a hexokinase-independent signalling pathway, such as that provided by SNF3 or RGT2 in yeast. Many papers on sugar sensing in plants cite work from two laboratories as evidence for hexokinase-independent hexose signalling in plants. The first is that in which cell-wall invertase and sucrose synthase genes were induced by treatment of a Chenopodium suspension culture with 30 mM 6-Deoxyglucose (6DOG) for 24 h (Roitsch et al., Plant Physiol 108, 285-294, 1995; Godt et al., J. Plant Physiol 146, 231-238, 1995). The second is that in which a patatin transgene in Arabidopsis was shown to be weakly induced by growth over several days on a mixture of 30 mM glucose plus 30 mM 3-O-methylglucose (3OMG), but strongly induced by growth on 30 mM Glc plus 90 mM 3OMG (Martin et al., Plant J, 11, 53-62, 1997). We are not aware of any examples of Arabidopsis genes which respond to 6DOG or 3OMG yet this is an area of wide significance. Identification of such a gene would help to establish if a hexokinase-independent signalling system operates in plants, and would provide a basis for establishment of a genetic screen for mutants, using the gene promoter linked to a reporter such as luciferase. The aim of this proposal is to discover any genes which are either activated or repressed by glucose AND by 3OMG and\/or 6DOG, but not by mannitol (an osmotic control). The use of both 3OMG and 6DOG will help to identify non-specific effects of either. All substrates will first be analysed by HPLC to confirm that they are pure. Arabidopsis Col-0 seedlings will be grown in vitro for 7 days in the absence of sugars, then treated with 30 mM glucose or glucose analogue for 8 h (these conditions are based on concentrations and time courses of Roitsch et al.). RNA will then be isolated from multiple independent plates to minimise biological variation."}],"provider":[{"contact":"unknown unknown","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Dorthe Villadsen","role":"submitter investigator biosource_provider","email":"Dorthe.Villadsen@ed.ac.uk"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"NASC:Growth Stage","value":[1.02]},{"category":"NASC:StockCode","value":["N1093"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPa","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["seedling"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":291214,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:205"},{"id":291215,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:201"},{"id":90396,"accession":"NASCLabelProtocol:1"},{"id":90407,"accession":"NASCExtractProtocol:1"},{"id":20050,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Percentile"},{"id":291216,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:205"},{"id":291217,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:204"},{"id":291218,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:203"},{"id":291219,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:202"},{"id":143,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4"},{"id":291220,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:202"},{"id":291221,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:201"},{"id":291222,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:204"},{"id":291223,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:203"},{"id":291213,"accession":"ftp:\/\/ftp.ebi.ac.uk\/pub\/databases\/microarray\/data\/experiment\/NASC\/E-NASC-8\/E-NASC-8.raw.1.zip"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":3,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":3,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":3,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":3,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
