Protocol Description	Two leaves per plant were mock-inoculated or challenged with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.  Separate plants were harvested for the 24 h and 48 h post-inoculation time points and challenged leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Twelve leaves were pooled from separate plants per sample.	Sclerotinia sclerotiorum strain 1980 was grown on minimal medium [Guo and Stotz (2007) Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 20: 1384•_Ð1395].  A randomized complete block design was used to grow wild-type and mutant plants in two 72-well flats.  Rosette leaves of 4 to 6-week old A. thaliana plants were inoculated by placing an agar plug (1.6 mm in diameter) containing actively growing hyphal tips on the adaxial leaf surface.  	"Total RNA was extracted with phenol-SDS and precipidated with LiCl [Sambrook et al. (1989). Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, U.S.A.).  RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer.  RNA purity was checked using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.  Labeled target cRNA was prepared from 3 •_µg total RNA samples as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip•_¨ Expression Analysis Technical Manual (701021 Rev. 5) protocols with an IVT incubation time of 16 hours.   (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = RNA polymerases)"	"Plants were grown in soil mix (Sunshine SB40 or 1:2 vermiculite:potting soil) under short day conditions with a 10 h light/14 h dark cycle at 22C under fluorescent light at 250-300 umol m•_Ð2 s•_Ð1.  Plants were fertilized every other week with a 1,000-fold diluted fertilizer stock (Hyponex Japan, Osaka). (Parameters: start time = 24, stop time = 48, time unit = hours, min temperature = 20, temperature unit = C, media = Soil)"
