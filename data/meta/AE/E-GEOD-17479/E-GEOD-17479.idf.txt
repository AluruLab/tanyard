Investigation Title	Effect of auxin signalling on flg22 response							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Effect of auxin signalling on flg22 response							
Experiment Description	Expression data after flg22 treatment on leaf discs in Col-0, 35S:AFB1 and 35S:miR393 We used microarrays to investigated the effect of auxin signalling on flg22 response pathway. We also compared if addition of auxin could simulated the 35S:AFB1 phenotype.  Keywords: stress response, disease state analysis Leaf discs were taken and let overnight in water to avoid the wound response. We then performed the treatment (flg22, flg22 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, flg22 +NAA, NAA) to the media. The samples where harvested and freeze in liquid nitrogen at 0, 1 and 2h after treatment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = signal calculated by RMA	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on Arabidopsis Genome ATH1 microarray. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	Plants were grown in short day environment (8hrs light/16 hrs dark) for 5 weeks at 20C.	background corrected using RMA, quantile normalized, values summarised by median-polish	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000	Leaves were inoculated with PstDc3000 at 10^6cfu/ml or with water. Tissues were harvested at 24hrs post inoculation	Trizol extraction according to the manufacturer instruction. The total RNA was then DNAse treated using the Qiagen DNAse. Purification was performed using the RNAeasy columns following the manufacturer instruction	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
