Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data of Col:LUC Arabidopsis treated with antimycin A (AA) in the presence or absence of a synthetic auxin analogue											
Experiment Description	Mitochondrial stress stimuli such as AA caused a transient suppression of auxin signaling and conversely, auxin treatment represses a part of the response to AA treatment. Expression data of Col:LUC Arabidopsis treated with antimycin A (AA) in the presence or absence of a synthetic auxin analogue Total RNA extraction was carried out on 80 mg of  Col:LUC Arabidopsis seedlings grown on B5 media for 10 days and transferred to fresh plates, containing either B5 media or B5 media supplemented with 4.5 µM NAA for an additional 3 days. Seedlings were treated with 50 µM AA for 3 hours.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. Additionally, GC RMA normalisation was carried out using Partek Genomics Suite. ID_REF =  VALUE = GC RMA signal intensities	Biotinylated aRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 400 ng total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 12.5 ug of the labelled aRNA was hybridised rotating at 60 rpm, 16 hr at 45 degreesC on GeneChip ATH1 arrays. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Analyses were carried out using 400 ng total RNA isolated in biological triplicate from Col:LUC seedlings grown on B5 media for 10 days and transferred to fresh plates, containing either B5 media or B5 media supplemented with 4.5 uM NAA for an additional 3 days.Seedlings were treated with 50 uM AA for 3 hours.	40 mg of Col-0 and Attim17-1 Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface steralized and plated on B5 media. Stratification was carried out at 4 degreesC in darkness, followed by long day growth conditions at 100 uE m -2 sec-1 at 22 degreesC.	RNA isolation was carried out using the Sigma-Aldrich Spectrum™ Plant Total RNA Kit.	GeneChips were scanned individually using a GeneChip Scanner 3000
