Protocol Name	P-MTAB-17955	P-MTAB-17956	P-MTAB-17957
Protocol Description	Seeds were cold treated for 48 h at 4ﾺC in darkness and then sterilized for 10 min with a solution of 10% (v/v) commercial bleach. After rinsing thoroughly with sterile distilled water, seeds were sown on one-half-concentrated Murashige and Skoog medium (MS), 1% (w/v) sucrose, solidified with 0.8% (w/v) agar and supplemented or not with 50 mg L-1 kanamycin. After two weeks in a 16 h/8 h day/night cycle, the seedlings were transferred to soil and grown at 22ﾰC, under an 8 h light/ 16 h dark cycle (short day conditions)during 4 weeks. (Parameters: start time = 6, time unit = weeks, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C)	Total RNA was isolated from leaves of 6-week-old plants harvested in liquid nitrogen, using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer protocol. (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	In this experiment we used leaves from Heterozygous mutant SDH1-1/sdh1-1  and Wassilewskija (Ws)Arabidopsis plants. We used leaves from 6-week-old plants were collected in the middle of light period and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Triplicate independent biological replicates of microarray experiments were performed on the Arabidopsis ATH1.
