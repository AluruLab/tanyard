Comment[Submitted Name]	Differential gene expression in mutants of Arabidopsis FAX1 compared to wild type
Experiment Description	DNA microarray analysis (Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip) on mutant lines of the gene At-FAX1 (At3g57280) in Arabidopsis thaliana was performed as described in Li et al. (2015). In total we analyzed the following comparisons: (A) flowers: fax1 knockout (n = 5) versus wild type (n = 5); (B) flowers: FAX1 over-expressors (n = 8, 4-times each line ox#2, ox#4) versus wild type (n = 5); (C) stems: fax1 knockout (n = 4) versus wild type (n = 4).  Additional files containing processed data are provided (see  http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/files/E-MTAB-3090).

Protocol Description	DNA microarray analysis (Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip) on mutant lines of the gene At-FAX1 (At3g57280) in Arabidopsis thaliana was performed as described in Li et al. (2015). Raw signal intensity values (CEL files) were computed from the scanned array images using the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console 3.0. For quality check and normalization, the raw intensity values were processed with Robin software (Lohse et al., 2010) default settings as described (Duy et al., 2011). Specifically, for background correction, the robust multiarray average normalization method (Irizarry et al., 2003) was performed across all arrays (between-array method). Statistical analysis of differential gene expression of mutant versus wild-type samples was carried out using the linear model-based approach developed by (Smyth, 2004). In total we analyzed the following comparisons: (A) flowers: fax1 knockout (n = 5) versus wild type (n = 5); (B) flowers: FAX1 over-expressors (n = 8, 4-times each line ox#2, ox#4) versus wild type (n = 5); (C) stems: fax1 knockout (n = 4) versus wild type (n = 4). The obtained P values were corrected for multiple testing using the nestedF procedure, applying a significance threshold of 0.05 in combination with the Benjamini and Hochberg false-discovery rate control (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

For DNA microarray analysis, we used mutant lines of the gene At-FAX1 (At3g57280) in Arabidopsis thaliana (Li et al., 2015). Tissue from flowers (stage 10-15 according to Smyth et al. [1990]) and from the 2nd to 4th internode of primary inflorescent stalks for each harvest was pooled from more than 10 individual 7-week-old plants and used for preparation of RNA samples by the Plant RNeasy Extraction kit (Qiagen). RNA (200 ng) of four to five independently harvested samples (n = 4-5) from wild type (Col-0 and WT2, segregated from heterozygous fax1-2), fax1 knockout (fax1-1 and fax1-2 lines) as well as FAX1 over-expressors (ox#2 and ox#4 lines) was processed and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays using the Affymetrix 3’-IVT Express and Hybridisation Wash and Stain kits (Affymetrix, High Wycombe, UK) according to the manufacturer`s instructions.

RNA (200 ng) was processed and biotin-labeled using the Affymetrix 3’-IVT Express kit (Affymetrix, High Wycombe, UK) according to the manufacturer`s instructions.	Hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays was performed using the Affymetrix Hybridisation Wash and Stain kits (Affymetrix, High Wycombe, UK) according to the manufacturer`s instructions.
