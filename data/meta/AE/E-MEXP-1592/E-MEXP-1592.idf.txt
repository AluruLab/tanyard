Experiment Description	comparison of Landsberg errecta wild-type with slm mutants in apex and flowers	
Protocol Name	P-MTAB-503	P-MTAB-502	P-MTAB-504	P-AFFY-2	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown	P-AFFY-6	P-MTAB-501	
Protocol Type	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	pool	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	
Protocol Description	Initial stratification for 2 days at 4 degrees<br><br>Plants were grown on soil under continuous light at  23Â°C<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, min temperature = 23, temperature unit = C, media = soil). Flowers were harvested on stage 10-12, and apex  SAM and flowers to stage 9.	Total RNA extraction using Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Tissue of 20 dissected apices was pooled for RNA extraction	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	raw data (Affy .CEL files) were quantile normalized, background corrected and transformed into expression estimates by gcRMA implemented in R. All settings were standard and all files were included in a single transformation. In the resulting text output file the Affy identifiers were mapped to AGI codes using the TIGR 4.0 release.<br><br>NOTE: expression estimates generated by gcRMA are log2 (log base 2) !
