Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome analysis of plant sulphate starvation and resupply
Experiment Description	Sulphur is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development. Reaching a thorough understanding of the molecular basis for changes in plant metabolism depending on the sulphur-nutritional status at the systems level will advance our basic knowledge and help target future crop improvement. Although the transcriptional responses induced by sulphate starvation have been studied in the past, knowledge of the regulation of sulphur metabolism is still fragmentary. This work focuses on the discovery of candidates for regulatory genes such as transcription factors (TFs) using â€˜omics technologies. For this purpose a short term sulphate-starvation / re-supply approach was used. ATH1 microarray studies and metabolite determinations yielded 21 TFs which responded more than 2-fold at the transcriptional level to sulphate starvation. Categorization by response behaviors under sulphate-starvation / re-supply and other nutrient starvations such as nitrate and phosphate allowed determination of whether the TF genes are specific for or common between distinct mineral nutrient depletions. Extending this co-behavior analysis to the whole transcriptome data set enabled prediction of putative downstream genes. Additionally, combinations of transcriptome and metabolome data allowed identification of relationships between TFs and downstream responses, namely, expression changes in biosynthetic genes and subsequent metabolic responses. Effect chains on glucosinolate and polyamine biosynthesis are discussed in detail. The knowledge gained from this study provides a blueprint for an integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics and application for the identification of uncharacterized genes. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in 30 mL of sterile liquid full nutrition (FN) medium (3 mM sulphate) or 150 Î¼M sulphate medium. Transferring pre-grown 7-days old seedlings to a sulphate depleted medium (0 Î¼M sulphate) assured immediate and continued sulphate starvation during the next two days of plant cultivation. On day 9 subsets of the sulphate depleted cultures were supplied with sulphate (500 Î¼M) and samples taken 30 min and 3 hours after re-supply. Four time points (full nutrition (FN), plants starved for 48 h (-S), plants re-supplied with sulphate for 30 minutes (30â€™ S) and plants re-supplied with sulphate for 3 hours (3 h S)) were subjected to the microarray analysis. Two biological repetitions of each sample were analyzed.

Protocol Description	Raw intensity values from the scanned ATH1 GeneChip were analyzed using RMAExpress. ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA signal intensity	Preparation and biotin labeling of cRNA, were performed by RZPD (now ATLAS Biolabs, Berlin, Germany)	ATH1 GeneChip hybridizations, were performed by RZPD (now ATLAS Biolabs, Berlin, Germany)	Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in 30 mL of sterile liquid full nutrition (FN) medium (3 mM sulphate) or 150 Î¼M sulphate medium. Transferring pre-grown 7-days old seedlings to a sulphate depleted medium (0 Î¼M sulphate) assured immediate and continued sulphate starvation during the next two days of plant cultivation. On day 9 subsets of the sulphate depleted cultures were supplied with sulphate (500 Î¼M) and samples taken 30 min and 3 hours after re-supply.	Arabidopsis seedlings (100-120 seeds) were grown in 30 ml of sterile liquid medium (250 mL Erlenmeyer glass flasks) on orbital shakers with constant, uniform fluorescent light (~50 µE in the flask) and temperature (22°C). Shaker speed was low (30 rpm) during the first three days, and then increased to 80 rpm.	Frozen plant material (100-200 mg) was ground in liquid nitrogen in a pre-cooled mortar or homogenised using metal beads (Ã˜ 5mm) in the MM200 homogenizer (Retsch). TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was then added and mixed well by vortexing. After 5 min incubation at room temperature the homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C in pre-cooled centrifuge. The supernatant was removed to a fresh Eppendorf tube and 400 µL of chloroform was added and mixed by vortexing before incubation at RT for 5 min. After 10 min centrifugation at 13,000 x g, at 4°C, the aqueous phase (~1 mL) was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube. RNA was precipitated with 0.5 mL of isopropanol and 0.5 mL of HSS buffer (0.8 M sodium citrate and 1.2 M NaCl) per 1 mL of aqueous phase, overnight at -20°C. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 30 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed twice with 1 mL 70% ethanol, air dried, and re-suspended in ca. 50 µL water (approx. 1 µg RNA/1 µL). RNA concentration, purity and integrity were determined by analysis with Bioanalyser (Agilent) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instruction.	Washing, staining, and scanning, were performed by RZPD (now ATLAS Biolabs, Berlin, Germany)
