Experiment Description	LEAFY COTYLEDON2 activity was induced via a LEC2-Glucocorticoid Receptor fusion protein in Arabidopsis seedlings. Experiment Overall Design: Transgenic plants carrying a 35S:LEC2-Glucocorticoid Receptor transgene were used for LEC2 induction.  Activity was induced in 8 day old seedlings for 1 or 4 hours with Dexamethasone application.  Controls include uninduced transgenic plants and non-transgenic plants treated with Dex. Experiment Overall Design: Two biological replicates per treatment.
