Experiment Description	The goal of this experiment was to identify the early responsive genes activated by the 22 amino acid peptide of bacterial flagellin (flg22) in Arabidopsis seedlings that are involved in the initial responses important for plant innate immunity. We used the microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying intial cellular and molecular responses to microbial associated molecualr patterns (MAMPs). Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with 2 nM flg22 for 30 min and 60 min.  Transcript profiles were analyzed and compared between control and treated cells to identify early flg22 responsive genes.

Protocol Description	Seedlings were grown in walk-in room on the top shelf for 8 days in MS liquid medium	Treated with 2nM flg22 for 30 and 60 min.	Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerâs protocol	Total RNA (9.0 Âµg) were amplified, biotinylated and fragmented using the BioArrayTM HighYieldTM RNA transcript labelling kit (Enzo) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized on the Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChips using the Affymetrix 640 Hybridization Oven. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	GeneChips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 7G with AutoLoader.	The data were analyzed in FlexArray with RMA including background correction and normalization.	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA log(2) signal intensity
