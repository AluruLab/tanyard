We used the microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying intial cellular and molecular responses to microbial associated molecualr patterns (MAMPs). Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with 2 nM flg22 for 30 min and 60 min.  Transcript profiles were analyzed and compared between control and treated cells to identify early flg22 responsive genes."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Matthew McCormack","role":"submitter","email":"boudsocq@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu"},{"contact":"Jen Sheen","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Horim Lee","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20164835,"authors":"Boudsocq M, Willmann MR, McCormack M, Lee H, Shan L, He P, Bush J, Cheng SH, Sheen J.","title":"Differential innate immune signalling via Ca(2+) sensor protein kinases","doi":"10.1038\/nature08794","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["8 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND","value":["flg22","none"]},{"name":"TREATMENT TIME","value":["30 minutes","60 minutes","n\/a minutes"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":448777,"accession":"P-GSE17382-3"},{"id":448774,"accession":"P-GSE17382-4"},{"id":448775,"accession":"P-GSE17382-1"},{"id":448773,"accession":"P-GSE17382-2"},{"id":448779,"accession":"P-GSE17382-7"},{"id":448776,"accession":"P-GSE17382-8"},{"id":448772,"accession":"P-GSE17382-5"},{"id":448778,"accession":"P-GSE17382-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
