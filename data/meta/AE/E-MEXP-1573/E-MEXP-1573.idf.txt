Protocol Description	"Total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy plant kit according to the manufacturer (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). The nucleic acid integrity was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of ribosomal RNA bands, and its quality by 260/280 and 260/230 ratios. If necessary, the RNA was cleaned further by phenol/chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction, followed by precipitation with 0.15 M sodium acetate, 50% (v/v) isopropanol.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"	"Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized and cold-treated for 3 d in the dark at 4?C, before being moved into the light. Seedlings were grown for 14 days on filter paper on media containing 0.8% (w/v) phytoagar (Research products international corp., Mt. Prospect, IL) 1 X Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts containing Gamborgs vitamins (Phytotechnology Laboratories, Shawnee Mission, KS), 1% (w/v) sucrose, 0.05% (w/v) MES (pH 5.7). Seeds were grown under continuous white light (25 µE/m2/s) at 22?C, with white light being generated by standard fluorescent bulbs augmented with 18,000 K fluorescent bulbs (Aqua-Glo, Rolf C. Hagen Corp., Mansfield, MA). Layers of black nylon mesh were used to reduce light levels as needed. <br>(Parameters: start time = 14, time unit = days, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C)"	"Seedlings on filter paper were transferred to liquid MS media containing either 10 µM BA or a DMSO vehicle control for 1 hr. The roots were removed and discarded, and the shoots frozen at -80?C until RNA was extracted."	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	"Affymetrix gene-chip data files were imported into GeneSpring GX 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), and the data normalized per chip to the 50th percentile and per gene to the median following the recommended procedure. Fold change mode was used for normalization."
