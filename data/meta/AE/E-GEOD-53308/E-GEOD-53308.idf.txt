Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis leaves under the condition of salt-induced senescence						
Experiment Description	Our study identified long term salt stress treatment to induce symptoms similar to developmental senescence. In order to identify possible crosstalk components shared between developmental and salt-triggered senescence. We first obtained the expression profile of Arabidopsis leaves under the condition of salt-induced senescence (4 days) and then compared it with the transcriptome of developmental leaf senescence. Wild type Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were grown hydroponically and treated with or without 150mM NaCl and harvested after 4 days of treatment.

Protocol Description	Raw data (CEL files) obtained from RNA hybridisation experiments were normalized with the affyPLM package from the Bioconductor software project (Gentleman et al., 2004) using the GCRMA that uses GC content of probes in normalization with RMA (Robust Multiple array Average) and  gives one value for each probe set instead of keeping probe level information (Wu et al., 2004). The transcriptional changes were determined by subtracting the normalized signal intensity of the control samples from that of induced samples. ID_REF =  VALUE = GC-RMA	Labeling was done using biotinylated UTP (Bio-11-UTP) according to the MessageAmp™ II aRNA Amplification protocol (Life Technologies). > > protocol from Life Technologies place during washing of array. Streptavidin was used to label (along with anti-streptavidin antibody) the bound Bio-11-UTP according to the MessageAmp™ II aRNA Amplification Bio-11-UTP and allowed for detection during array scanning. This is based on the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual. protocol from Life Technologies MessageAmp™ II aRNA Amplification protocol from Life Technologies	Hybridizaton was done according to the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual; the wash followed the protocol EukGE-WS2v4_450 for Rice Genome Arrays. Technical Manual used the wash protocol EukGE-WS2v4_450 for Rice Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual and the wash protocol EukGE-WS2v4_450 for RiceGenome Arrays Genome Arrays	150 mM NaCl was supplied to the liquid medium and maintained for 4 days	Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Col-0 ecotype) were surface sterilized. Plants were grown in a hydroponic system in a climate chamber at an 8-h light (150 umol m-2 sec-1 20 degrees C, 60% RH)/16-h dark (16 degrees C, 75% RH) cycle. The medium used was essentially as described by Loque et al. (2003). Six plants were grown in each hydroponic box and the growth medium was replaced with fresh, autoclaved solution every seventh day to limit the growth of microorganisms and supply enough nutrients for normal plant growth.	Total RNA extraction from control and salt treated plants was done using RNAeasy Plant mini kit from Qiagen.	Scanning was done using the Gene Chip Operating System (GCOS) scanner.
