Experiment Description	"Wild type, pkl, pkr2 and pkl pkr2 plants were grown, and gene expression in roots was compared at the age of 5 days. <br>"

Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	grow	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation
Protocol Description	"Total RNA was prepared from frozen tissue using Trizol and purified with RNeasy columns (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany).<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"	"Seeds were plated on sterile MS medium containing 1% agar. After stratification for 48h at 4Â°C, plates were incubated in Weiss growth chambers (Weiss, Switzerland). Growth conditions were 16 h photoperiod, 23Â°C and white light of 70 umol/m2s. Twelve days after induction of germination, 4 h after dawn, complete seedlings were harvested into liquid nitrogen. The entire experiment was performed twice providing independent biological replicates. <br>(Parameters: start time = 12, time unit = days, min temperature = 23, temperature unit = C, media = MS medium containing 1% agar)"	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	"Signal values were derived from Affymetrix *.cel files using a modified version of the robust multiple array normalisation (GCRMA, [Wu, 2003])."
