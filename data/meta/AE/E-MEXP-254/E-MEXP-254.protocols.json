Cold treated seeds were placed on the surface of the substrate with the aid of forceps at a distance of approximately 3 cm between seedlings. The substrate, consisting of a 3:1 potting soil:sand mixture, was sieved through a 5 mm mesh and thoroughly moistened. Until germination plant containers were covered with a clear plastic foil to maintain sufficient soil moisture. For the duration of the experiment the soil was moistened by placing plant containers on wetted fleece. For all other experiments plants were grown at same densities (140 plants\/box) in flat plastic containers (30 × 47 × 6 cm). Containers were placed in growth cabinets under controlled environment (21 ± 1°C, 16 h light, 100 µmol photons s-1 m-2).","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null,"parameter":["max temperature","min temperature","start time","stop time"]},{"id":844794,"accession":"P-MEXP-6893","name":"P-MEXP-6893","text":"Soil residue was carefully removed from roots using brushes and the roots were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and grounded with mortar and pestle.
