Experiment Description	Arabidopsis MPK4 is involved in the control of antagonism between salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET)/jasmonic acid (JA) pathways in the plant innate immune system as a repressor of the SA pathway, but an activator of the ET/JA pathway. Here we and use comparative microarray analysis of ctr1, ctr1/mpk4, mpk4 and wild type to show that MPK4 is required for only a narrow subset of ET regulated genes.

Protocol Description	Plant were treated as equaly as possible	plants was grown in a chamber with 16hr light (21C) and 8hr dark (16C).	Total RNA was isolated from leaves of 3 weaks old plants, using the  TRIzol protocol (invitrogen).	Total RNA was amplified and Biotin labeled using the Affymetrix Enzo Kit method Described in Affymetrix GeneChip Technical Analysis Manual	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	Transformations: Gene expression intensities was normalized using R implementation of qspline (Workman et al., 2002; Gautier et al., 2004). An implementation in the statistical language R of the logit-t method (Lemon et al., 2003) applying two-way ANOVA was used to calculate statistical significance for differentially gene expression. Gene expression index values were calculated using the PM only R implementation of the Li and Wong (2001) method (Gautier et al., 2004). # Refs# # Workman C, Jensen LJ, Jarmer H, Berka R, Gautier L, Nielsen HB, Saxild HH, Nielsen C, Brunak S, Knudsen S.
