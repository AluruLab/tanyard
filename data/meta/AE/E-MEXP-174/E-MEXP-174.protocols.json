An implementation in the statistical language R of the logit-t method (Lemon et al., 2003) applying two-way ANOVA was used to calculate statistical significance for differentially gene expression. Gene expression index values were calculated using the PM only R implementation of the Li and Wong (2001) method (Gautier et al., 2004). # Refs# # Workman C, Jensen LJ, Jarmer H, Berka R, Gautier L, Nielsen HB, Saxild HH, Nielsen C, Brunak S, Knudsen S.
