Experiment Description	We used microarrays to detail Arabidopsis gene expression in response to paraquat, a herbicide that acts as a terminal oxidant of photosystem I that in the light leads to the enhanced generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide inside plastids. Within a few hours after paraquat treatment changes in nuclear gene expression occur. Distinct sets of genes were activated that were different from those induced by another reactive oxygen species, singlet oxygen. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves were harvested 1, 2, and 4 h after spraying either with a solution of 20 microM paraquat (methyl viologen, Sigma) in 0.1% Tween or with Tween alone for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays. Plants were grown on soil for 3 weeks under continuous light at 90 mmol. m-2 . s-1. For each sample, the rosette leaves of five to six 3-week-old plants (before they start bolting) were collected for RNA extraction. Total RNAs from two separate biological experiments were pooled for the preparation of cDNA and the subsequent synthesis of biotin-labeled complementary RNA as recommended by Affymetrix.

Protocol Description	Plants were sprayed either with a solution of 20 microM paraquat (methyl viologen, Sigma) in 0.1% Tween or with Tween alone, and rosette leaves were harvested at 1, 2, and 4 h after spraying.	Plants were grown on soil for 3 weeks under continuous light at 90 mmol. m-2 . s-1	total RNA extraction was performed according to Melzer, S., Majewski, D. M. & Apel, K. (1990) Plant Cell 2, 953-961: RNA was isolated with some modifications as described by Chirgwin et al. (1979). The plant material was ground under liquid nitrogen with a mortar and a pestle and homogenized in 4 mL of lysis buffer (4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 2% Nlauroyl-sarcosin and 1 YO o-mercaptoethanol) with an Ultra Turrax (Janke and Kunkel, D7813 Stanfen, F. R. G.). Cell debris and denatured proteins were pelleted and the nucleic acids in the supernatant were precipitated overnight in the presence of 0.75 volumes of ethanol. The pellet was homogenized in 4 mL of Tes (10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS) with the help of a potter, and the homogenate was extracted with phenol/chloroform and chloroform. Total RNA was precipitated overnight with 2 M LiCl at 4Â&deg;C. Poly(A)-containing RNA was isolated according to Aviv and Leder (1972).	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 20 ug total RNA (Eukaryotic Target Preparation, 2002, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 15 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400, protocol EukGE-WS2v4.	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CHP Analysis (ExpressionStat).
