Within a few hours after paraquat treatment changes in nuclear gene expression occur. Distinct sets of genes were activated that were different from those induced by another reactive oxygen species, singlet oxygen. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves were harvested 1, 2, and 4 h after spraying either with a solution of 20 microM paraquat (methyl viologen, Sigma) in 0.1% Tween or with Tween alone for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays. Plants were grown on soil for 3 weeks under continuous light at 90 mmol. m-2 . s-1. For each sample, the rosette leaves of five to six 3-week-old plants (before they start bolting) were collected for RNA extraction. Total RNAs from two separate biological experiments were pooled for the preparation of cDNA and the subsequent synthesis of biotin-labeled complementary RNA as recommended by Affymetrix."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Christophe Laloi","role":"submitter","email":"claloi@ethz.ch"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":14508004,"authors":"Roel G L op den Camp, Dominika Przybyla, Christian Ochsenbein, Christophe Laloi, Chanhong Kim, Antoine Danon, Daniela Wagner, Eva Hideg, Cornelia GÃ¶bel, Ivo Feussner, Mena Nater, Klaus Apel","title":"Rapid induction of distinct stress responses after the release of singlet oxygen in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.014662","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["3 weeks"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Landsberg erecta"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["flu1-1"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["rosette leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND","value":["methyl viologen dichloride","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":460148,"accession":"P-10464-1"},{"id":460149,"accession":"P-10464-2"},{"id":460147,"accession":"P-10464-3"},{"id":460146,"accession":"P-10464-4"},{"id":460145,"accession":"P-10464-5"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
