M. & Apel, K. (1990) Plant Cell 2, 953-961: RNA was isolated with some modifications as described by Chirgwin et al. (1979). The plant material was ground under liquid nitrogen with a mortar and a pestle and homogenized in 4 mL of lysis buffer (4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 2% Nlauroyl-sarcosin and 1 YO o-mercaptoethanol) with an Ultra Turrax (Janke and Kunkel, D7813 Stanfen, F. R. G.). Cell debris and denatured proteins were pelleted and the nucleic acids in the supernatant were precipitated overnight in the presence of 0.75 volumes of ethanol. The pellet was homogenized in 4 mL of Tes (10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS) with the help of a potter, and the homogenate was extracted with phenol\/chloroform and chloroform. Total RNA was precipitated overnight with 2 M LiCl at 4Â°C. Poly(A)-containing RNA was isolated according to Aviv and Leder (1972).","type":"nucleic_acid_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6","name":"P-AFFY-6","text":"Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
