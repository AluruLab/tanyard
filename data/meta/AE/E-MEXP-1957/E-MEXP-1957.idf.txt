Protocol Description	Wild-type Col-0 plants were grown for 4d in a UV-B-supplemented light field (Osram L18W/30 and Philips TL20W/01RS) under a 3-mm cut-off filter of the WG series (Schott, Mainz, Germany) with half-maximal transmission at 345 nm (i.e. UV-B). This 345 nm cut-off was exchanged with a 305 nm cut-off at 1h before harvesting (i.e. 1h +UV-B); UV-B fluence rate: 1.5 micromole m-2 s-1, photosynthetically active radiation: 3.3 micromole m-2 s-1.<br>(Parameters: start time = 1, time unit = hours, min temperature = 18, max temperature = 23, temperature unit = C, media = Murashige and Skoog)	Plants were grown for 4d in a UV-B-supplemented light field (Osram L18W-30 and Philips TL20W-01RS) under a 3-mm cut-off filter of the WG series (Schott, Mainz, Germany) with half-maximal transmission at 345 nm (i.e. UV-B minus); UV-B fluence rate: 0 micromole m-2 s-1, photosynthetically active radiation: 3.3 micromole m-2 s-1.<br>(Parameters: start time = 4, time unit = days, min temperature = 18, max temperature = 23, temperature unit = C, media = Murashige and Skoog)	cop1 mutant plants are grown in continuous white light supplemented with low-level UV-B radiation. We make use of cut-off filters to generate different radiation conditions in the UV-B wavelength region. On one hand a 345 nm cut-off filter is used to free the incident radiation from UV-B (i.e. UV-B minus control) whereas a 305 nm cut off filter is used to analyse response to UV-B (i.e. +UV-B sample). Continuous and short-time supplementary UV-B irradiation of Arabidopsis cop1 mutant seedlings will be compared.
