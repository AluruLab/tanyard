Experiment Description	Dedifferentiation signifies the capacity of somatic cells to acquire stem cell-likeproperties. This process characterizes the transition of differentiated plant cells toprotoplasts (plant cells devoid of cell walls), a transition accompanied by widespreadchromatin decondensation. Transcriptome profiling of dedifferentiating cells revealedstriking similarities with senescing cells; both display a large increase in the expressionof genes of specific transcription factor (TF) families including ANAC, WRKY, bZIPand C2H2. We further showed that leaves induced to senesce by exposure to dark displaycharacteristic features of dedifferentiating cells including widespread chromatindecondensation, disruption of the nucleolus and condensation of rRNA genes.Considering that premature senescence can be induced by various stress conditions, ourresults suggest that plant cells response to certain stresses converges on cellulardedifferentiation whereby cells first acquire stem cell-like state prior to acquisition of anew cell fate (e.g., reentry into the cell cycle, or death). Experiment Overall Design: Labeled cRNA was prepared and hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips, 4 biological repeats (2 Ler and 2 kyp-2) for protoplasts and 3 biological repeats for leaves (2 Ler and 1 kyp-2). Experiment Overall Design: Partek data processing results linked below as supplementary file.

Protocol Description	Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype and kyp-2 mutant were sown and incubated at 4oC for 4 days and then grown under long-day conditions (14 h light) at 21oC	Protoplasts were isolated from 5-6 week-old plants by incubating rosette leaves for 12-14 hours in N&M medium containing 1% cellulase âonozukaâ R-10 and 0.25% macerozyme R10 (Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd., Japan). Protoplasts were separated by centrifugation, washed once with CPW medium and precipitated by centrifugation at low speed for 5 min.	Total RNAs were prepared from leaves and protoplasts using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit according to the manufacturerâs protocol (Qiagen)	The probe Preparation, cDNA synthesis, cRNA reactions and hybridizationaccording to Affymetrix GeneChipÂ®  Expression Analysis Technical Manual was carried out in the Weizmann Institute microarray unit.
