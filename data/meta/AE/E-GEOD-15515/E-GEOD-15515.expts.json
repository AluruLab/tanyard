This process characterizes the transition of differentiated plant cells toprotoplasts (plant cells devoid of cell walls), a transition accompanied by widespreadchromatin decondensation. Transcriptome profiling of dedifferentiating cells revealedstriking similarities with senescing cells; both display a large increase in the expressionof genes of specific transcription factor (TF) families including ANAC, WRKY, bZIPand C2H2. We further showed that leaves induced to senesce by exposure to dark displaycharacteristic features of dedifferentiating cells including widespread chromatindecondensation, disruption of the nucleolus and condensation of rRNA genes.Considering that premature senescence can be induced by various stress conditions, ourresults suggest that plant cells response to certain stresses converges on cellulardedifferentiation whereby cells first acquire stem cell-like state prior to acquisition of anew cell fate (e.g., reentry into the cell cycle, or death). Experiment Overall Design: Labeled cRNA was prepared and hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips, 4 biological repeats (2 Ler and 2 kyp-2) for protoplasts and 3 biological repeats for leaves (2 Ler and 1 kyp-2).
