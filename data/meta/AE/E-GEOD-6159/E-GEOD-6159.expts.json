Excessive fertiliser applications are both costly and can lead to unnecessary pollution. A possible solution to this problem is to use sensor (GM or non-GM) technologies that exploit the changes in plant gene expression profiles under incipient nutrient deficiency. The aim of this project is to identify genes upregulated in the early stages of nutrient depletion. Methods: Arabidopsis ecotype Col-5 (N1644) will be grown hydroponically using established techniques. In parallel experiments NP and K will be withdrawn individually after 21 d growth. RNA will be extracted from shoots of nutrient replete (control) and nutrient depleted plants 24 h after the removal of nutrients. Shoot nutrient content will be assayed by ICP-EMS as a reference. By comparing expression profiles we will be able to differentiate between genes that are upregulated by lack of specific nutrients and those upregulated by a universal stress-response system. Promoters and transcripts of these genes will underpin the development of novel sensor technologies and knowledge of the gene expression profiles will improve our understanding of the physiology of plant mineral nutrition.
