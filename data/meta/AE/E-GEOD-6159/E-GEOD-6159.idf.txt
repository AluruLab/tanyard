Experiment Description	Background: Since chemical assays of soil nutrients are unreliable the UK horticultural and agricultural industries routinely apply large amounts of inorganic fertiliser to maintain crop yields and quality. Excessive fertiliser applications are both costly and can lead to unnecessary pollution. A possible solution to this problem is to use sensor (GM or non-GM) technologies that exploit the changes in plant gene expression profiles under incipient nutrient deficiency. The aim of this project is to identify genes upregulated in the early stages of nutrient depletion. Methods: Arabidopsis ecotype Col-5 (N1644) will be grown hydroponically using established techniques. In parallel experiments NP and K will be withdrawn individually after 21 d growth. RNA will be extracted from shoots of nutrient replete (control) and nutrient depleted plants 24 h after the removal of nutrients. Shoot nutrient content will be assayed by ICP-EMS as a reference. By comparing expression profiles we will be able to differentiate between genes that are upregulated by lack of specific nutrients and those upregulated by a universal stress-response system. Promoters and transcripts of these genes will underpin the development of novel sensor technologies and knowledge of the gene expression profiles will improve our understanding of the physiology of plant mineral nutrition. Experiment Overall Design: 4 samples

First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM Ã-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.   ; Protocol Type = labeling; Performers: John,Y,Okyere, Janet,,Higgins	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
