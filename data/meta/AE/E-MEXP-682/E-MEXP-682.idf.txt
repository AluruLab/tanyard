Experiment Description	The aim of this experiment is to test the ability of the ortholog of Arabidopsis LFY gene from Leanworthia crassa (Lcr) to complement an Arabidopsis LFY mutant. Plants used are homozygous lfy6 mutants (EMS alleles) in Ler background which are transformed or not (for the lfy6 mutant) by genomic clones for Arabidopsis LFY (AthLFY) or Leanworthia crassa LFY (LcrLFY). Flowering was synchronized by growing plants in SD then shifting them to LD. 2 time points samples (wild type Ler) were taken at the end of the SD period as a reference for genes induced by shifting to LD, irrespective of the status at the LFY locus.

Protocol Description	Plants were grown on soil for 30 days under short day conditions (8 hr light/16 hr darkness) at 23 desgrees C and 65% relative humidity.	Plants were grown on soil for 30 days under short day conditions (8 hr light/16 hr darkness) at 23C and 65% relative humidity. Plants where then shifted to long day conditions (16 hr light/8 hr darkness) at 23C and 65% relative humidity for 8 days. Inflorescence meristem were then dissected.	Plants were grown on soil for 30d under short day conditions (8h light/ 16h darkness) at 23C and 65% relative humidity. Shoot apical meristem were dissected.	25-30 dissected shoot apical meristems were pooled.
