Experiment Description	Jasmonate and ethylene are two important plant hormones contributing plant resistance to biotic stresses synergistically. Our experimental results showed that two ethylene activated transcription factors (EIN3/EIL1) integrated both jasmonate and ethylene signaling in multiple developmental and defense events. To understand the importance of EIN3/EIL1 in jasmonate signaling, we utilized microarray analysis to identify how much the jasmonate regulated genes are governed by EIN3/EIL1. Our results indicated that EIN3/EIL1 act sequentially in a cascade of transcriptional regulation initiated by jasmonate. Compare the JA regulated genes in Col-0, coi1-2 and ein3 eil1 to identify how much transcripts are dependent on COI1 or EIN3/EIL1

Protocol Description	7-day-old seedlings were treated with 100 uM MeJA or Mock (EtOH) for 4 hr	Seedlings were grown under long-day and 23 C on MS media	total RNA was extracted by Trizol method and was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated total RNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 100ng total RNA (GeneChipÂ® Whole Transcript Sense Target Labeling Assay Manual).	This procedure used GeneChipÂ® hybridization, wash, and stain kit, three heating blocks are used: one at 65C, one at 99C, and the  third one at 45C	GeneChips were scanned using The GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G, and is controlled by GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS).	By using Expression Console software from Affymetrix performed RMA analysis and got QC report. *.CEL files as input in RMA method and by using Partek GS 6.4 software got RMA Data. Then ANOVA analysis was performed based on RMA Data.	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA normalized signal
