Experiment Description	To gain insights into the mechanisms of TOC1 function in the Arabidopsis circadian clock we performed transcriptional profiling of Wild-Type (WT) and and TOC1 overexpressor plants (TOC1-ox). Experiment Overall Design: Comparisons of WT and TOC1-ox. Three biological replicates synchronized under 12-hour light:12-hour dark (LD) cycles for 12 days. Samples were collected at Zeitgeber Time 15 (ZT15).

Protocol Description	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 1 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual Rev. 3, 2005, Affymetrix).	Carmaweb software (https://carmaweb.genome.tugraz.at) was used for data processing with the gcRMA algorythm for normalization. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the empirical Bayes moderated t statistics from the LiMMA package. Genes with an FDR < 5% were selected as misregulated in TOC1-ox	Samples were collected at Zeitgeber Time 15 (ZT15).	Seedlings were grown on MS3 medium under 12-hour light:12-hour dark (LD) cycles for 12 days.	Total RNA extractions were performed with Pure Link Total RNA Purification System (Invitrogen).
