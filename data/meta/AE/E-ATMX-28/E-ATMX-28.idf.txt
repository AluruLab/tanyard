Experiment Description	"We exposed plants to methyl viologen (MV), a redox cycling herbicide in the light, and perform biochemical and Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip experiments under conditions in which photosynthesis was active and the antioxidant response well conserved. Samples of total RNA were obtained from a pool of 25 Arabidopsis specimens from two independent biological replicates from the aerial parts of 2h MV-treated and non-treated control seedlings."

Protocol Description	"Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Col-0 plants were grown in soil in 5 cm pots (50 per flat) under 120 µmol quanta m-2 s-1 with a 16-h period at 23 °C, and relative humidity of 65-70 % for 2 weeks. "	"Two week-old Arabidopsis plants were transferred to 50 µM MV, 0.01 % Tween 20 for 2 h at 120 µmol quanta m-2 s-1 and 20°C.   Control plants were run in parallel, and handled as treated plants, except that MV was omitted. After treatment, aerial parts were separated from the roots, and immediately processed for RNA isolation. "	"Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany) following the manufacturers procedure. Quality and quantity of RNA was monitored spectrophotometrically at 260 and 280 nm. RNA with a ratio (A260/A280) higher than 1.2 was used for further analysis."
