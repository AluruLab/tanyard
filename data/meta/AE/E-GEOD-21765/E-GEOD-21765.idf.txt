Experiment Description	Glycolytic Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phospate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate by coupling with the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. We generated mutants of the Arabidopsis plastidial GAPDH isoforms (At1g79530, At1g16300; GAPCp1, GAPCp2). gapcp double mutants (gapcp1 gapcp2) display a drastic phenotype of arrested root development and sterility.Complex interactions occurring between ABA and sugar signal transduction pathways have been shown, but the molecular mechanisms connecting both pathways are not well understood. Since we found drastic carbohydrate changes in gapcp1 gapcp2, we studied their response to ABA. by performing a microarray analysis comparing gapcp1 gapcp2 and wild type seedlings after a long term treatment with ABA. 15-day old Arabidopsis seedlings (Col 0)  and gapcp1gapcp2 double mutants were used  for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Protocol Description	Seeds were germinated and grown vertically in MS 1/5 with Gamborg vitamins. Light condicitions: 16 hours light, 8 hours dark. Temperature: 22ÂºC. Light 100 Î¼mol mâ2 sâ1.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen).RNA was extracted from three sets of gapcp double mutants and wild type plants grown at the same time. RNA integrity was determined using RNA 6000 Nano LabchipsÂ® in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer following the manufactures protocol. The purified RNA (8 Î¼g) was used to generate first-strand cDNA in a reverse transcription reaction (One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents; Affymetrix). After second-strand synthesis, the double-stranded cDNAs were used to generate cRNA via an in vitro transcriptional reaction.	Seedlings were treated with  0,75 microM ABA for 8 days	The cRNA was labeled with biotin, and 20 Î¼g of the labeled cRNA was fragmented. The size distribution of the cRNAs and fragmented cRNAs was assessed using an Eppendorf Biophotometer and electrophoresis.	Fragmented cRNA (15 Î¼g) was added to 300 Î¼L of hybridization solution, and 200 Î¼L of this mixture was used for hybridization on Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16 h at 45Â°C. The standard wash and double-stain protocols (EukGE-WS2v5-450) were applied using an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450.	The arrays (three replicates of each treatment) were scanned on an Affymetrix GeneChip scanner 3000.	Fluorescence images were normalized with the software GCOS from Affymetrix. Data were analyzed and compared using the dChip software  ( http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/~cli/complab/dchip/)	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = dChip normalized signal
