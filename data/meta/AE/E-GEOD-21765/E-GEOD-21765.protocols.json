RNA integrity was determined using RNA 6000 Nano Labchips® in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer following the manufactures protocol. The purified RNA (8 μg) was used to generate first-strand cDNA in a reverse transcription reaction (One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents; Affymetrix). After second-strand synthesis, the double-stranded cDNAs were used to generate cRNA via an in vitro transcriptional reaction.","type":"nucleic_acid_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":821799,"accession":"P-GSE21765-5","name":"P-GSE21765-5","text":"The cRNA was labeled with biotin, and 20 μg of the labeled cRNA was fragmented.
