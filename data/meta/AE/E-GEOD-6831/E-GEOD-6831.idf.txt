Experiment Description	In the absence of adaptive immunity displayed by animals, plants respond locally to biotic challenge via inducible basal defense networks activated through recognition and response toconserved pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In addition, immunity can be induced in tissues remote from infection sites via systemic acquired resistance (SAR), initiated following gene-for-gene recognition between plant resistance proteins and microbial effectors.The nature of the mobile signal and remotely activated networks responsible for establishing SAR remain unclear. Here we show that despite the absence of PAMP contact, systemically responding leaves rapidly activate a SAR transcriptional signature with strong similarity to local basal defense. Jasmonates have previously been implicated in systemic signalling in response to wounding and plant herbivory but not SAR. We present several lines of evidence that suggest jasmonates may also be central to SAR. Jasmonic acid (JA) rapidly accumulates in phloem exudates of leaves challenged with an avirulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae. In systemically responding leaves transcripts associated with jasmonate biosynthesis are upregulated and JA increases transiently. SAR can be mimicked by foliar JA application and is abrogated in mutants impaired in jasmonate synthesis or response. We conclude that, jasmonate signalling appears to mediate long-distance information transmission. Moreover, the systemic transcriptional response shares extraordinary overlap with local herbivory and wounding responses, indicating that jasmonates may be central to an evolutionarily conserved signalling network, which decodes multiple abiotic and biotic stress signals.

Protocol Description	Leaves were inoculated with virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000. DC3000 cultures were grown overnight in 10 ml of Kings B solution (King et al., 1954) supplemented with antibiotics. Plants were inoculated with DC3000 containing the empty vector plasmid pVSP61 (Innes et al., 1993) Antibiotics rifampicin(50 lg ml)1) and kanamycin (25 lg ml)1) were used for selection of the bacterium and plasmid, respectively. Overnight cultures were washed once in 10 mM MgCl2 and final cell densities were adjusted to OD600 0.2. Both sides of a leaf were infiltrated on their abaxial surface with a needleless 1ml syringe. At least 5 leaves per plant were inoculated and 16 plants were pooled to make this sample.	Leaves were inoculated with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000::hrpA- mutant. DC3000::hrpA- cultures were grown overnight in 10 ml of Kings B solution (King et al., 1954) supplemented with antibiotics. Plants were inoculated with DC3000::hrpA- containing the empty vector plasmid pVSP61 (Innes et al., 1993) Antibiotics rifampicin(50 lg ml)1) and kanamycin (25 lg ml)1) were used for selection of the bacterium and plasmid, respectively. Overnight cultures were washed once in 10 mM MgCl2 and final cell densities were adjusted to OD600 0.2. Both sides of a leaf were infiltrated on their abaxial surface with a needleless 1ml syringe. At least 5 leaves per plant were inoculated and 16 plants were pooled to make this sample.	Leaves were inoculated with avirulent Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000(avrRpm1). DC3000(avrRpm1) cultures were grown overnight in 10 ml of Kings B solution (King et al., 1954) supplemented with antibiotics. Plants were inoculated with DC3000 containing the vector plasmid pVSP61 (Innes et al., 1993) carrying the avirulence gene avrRpm1. Antibiotics rifampicin(50 lg ml)1) and kanamycin (25 lg ml)1) were used for selection of the bacterium and plasmid, respectively. Overnight cultures were washed once in 10 mM MgCl2 and final cell densities were adjusted to OD600 0.2. Both sides of a leaf were infiltrated on their abaxial surface with a needleless 1ml syringe. At least 5 leaves per plant were inoculated and 16 plants were pooled to make this sample.	standard NASC extraction protocol	standard NASC labeling protocol	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
