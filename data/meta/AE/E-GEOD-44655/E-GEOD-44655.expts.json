HSFA1s are the master regulators of heat shock response. As a part of the heat shock response, HSFA2 can prolong the heat shock response and amplify the heat shock response in response to repeat heat shock. To identify the heat-shock-responsive genes differentially regulated by HSFA1s and HSFA2, we compared the transcriptomic differences of plants containing only constitutively expressed HSFA1s or HSFA2 after heat stress. hsfa2 (the KO mutant of HSFA2, Col-0 background) and A2QK-10 (CaMV 35S:HSFA2 in QK mutant; QK is HSFA1a\/b\/d\/e quadruple KO mutant) were used to compare the difference of heat shock response when plants lack HSFA1s or HSFA2. The aim is to find the HSFA1s- and HSFA2-preferred regulating genes after heat stress. As the control samples, wild type is the plant with normal heat shock response, and QK (HSFA1s KO mutant, Col-0 and Ws mixed background) is the plant that lost the heat shock response controlled by HSFA1s."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Yee Y Charng","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Hsiang C Liu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Hsiang-chin Liu","role":"submitter","email":"liuaway@gmail.com"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["7 days"]},{"category":"background","value":["Col-0","mixed (Col-0 and Ws)"]},{"category":"condition","value":["control (22ï¿½C)","heat shock (37ï¿½C)"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["hsfa1 quadruple mutant (QK)","hsfa2 KO mutant","overexpression of HSFA2 in QK (hsfa1 quadruple mutant)","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole seedling"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"BACKGROUND","value":["Col-0","mixed (Col-0 and Ws)"]},{"name":"CONDITION","value":["control (22ï¿½C)","heat shock (37ï¿½C)"]},{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["hsfa1 quadruple mutant (QK)","hsfa2 KO mutant","overexpression of HSFA2 in QK (hsfa1 quadruple mutant)","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":16,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":752543,"accession":"P-GSE44655-1"},{"id":752544,"accession":"P-GSE44655-7"},{"id":752545,"accession":"P-GSE44655-6"},{"id":752546,"accession":"P-GSE44655-5"},{"id":752547,"accession":"P-GSE44655-4"},{"id":752549,"accession":"P-GSE44655-3"},{"id":752548,"accession":"P-GSE44655-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0}]}]}}
