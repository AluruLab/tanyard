Comment[Submitted Name]	Analysis of a N-6 adenosine methylation deficient plant
Experiment Description	The embryo lethal adenosine methylase tDNA knockout line SALK_074069 was partially complemented with its cDNA driven by the embryo specific ABI3 promoter (A6 lines). The plants have reduced adenosine methylation and show pleiotropic phenotypes. Rosette leaves were harvested from 3 week old plants, both wild-type and mutant plants in triplicate and analysed using the Affymetrix ATH1 array. The 3rd to 6th rosette leaves were harvested in triplicate from 3 week old wild-type and mutant plants (A6). Total RNA was extracted and hybridised to the Affymetrix ATH1 array.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA pre-normalised and normalised to the median of the gene signal across all samples in Log2 scale.	Scanning was performed accordinf to manufactures' instruction using an Affymetrix 3000 7G scanner	Samples were hybridised at the NASC microarray core facility according to manufactures' instructions. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics station 450.	RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN Rneasy kit	Plants were grown in a growth chamber with 20 hr light, 4 hr dark cycle at 20 degree C.	Labelling was performed using the Affymetrix 3' IVT express kit as per manufactures' instructions	RNA data was analysed using Genespring GX 11 software (Agilent technologies) using the RMA probe sumarisation algorithm. Each gene signal was then normalised to the median of the gene signal across all samples
