The plants have reduced adenosine methylation and show pleiotropic phenotypes. Rosette leaves were harvested from 3 week old plants, both wild-type and mutant plants in triplicate and analysed using the Affymetrix ATH1 array. The 3rd to 6th rosette leaves were harvested in triplicate from 3 week old wild-type and mutant plants (A6).
