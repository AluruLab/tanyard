Investigation Title	Expression data from trichomes and pavement cells									
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from trichomes and pavement cells
Experiment Description	Comparison of cell sap from trichomes and pavement cells.  We performed a detailed transcriptome analysis of cell sap from leaf epidermal cell types using the Affymetrix Ath1 chip. Trichome and pavement cell sap was collected from leaves of 5 week old plants.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA log2 expression measures	standard Affymetrix protocol	Arabidopsis plants were cultivated in growth chambers at 20oC/18°C under a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle until seed set.	The data were analyzed with Bioconductor using the RMA normalization procedure	standard Affymetrix protocol	Pavement cells of Arabidopsis leaves were sampled using microcapilaries as described in Brandt et al., 1999	Trichome cells of Arabidopsis leaves were sampled using microcapilaries as described in Brandt et al., 1999	Extraction of total RNA was performed using the Quiagen Micro RNA Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions	The GeneChip Expression 3' Amplification reagents for IVT labeling Kit according to the manufacturer’s was then used to synthesize biotin-labeled cRNA from template cDNA by in vitro transcription.	Amplification (one round) was performed using the ArcturusRiboAmp Kit, labelling and hybridisation were performed with the GeneChip Expression 3' Amplification reagents for IVT labeling Kit according to the manufacturer’s (Affymetrix, CA)
