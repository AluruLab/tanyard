These changes in light quality trigger a series of responses known collectively as the shade avoidance syndrome. During shade avoidance, stems elongate at the expense of leaf and storage organ expansion, there is reduced branching, and flowering is accelerated. We identified several loci in Arabidopsis, mutations in which lead to plants defective in multiple shade avoidance outputs.  Here we describe SAV3, an aminotransferase, and show that SAV3 catalyzes the formation of indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) from L-tryptophan (L-Trp), the first step in a previously proposed, but uncharacterized, auxin biosynthetic pathway. This pathway can be rapidly deployed to biosynthesize auxin at the high levels required to initiate the multiple changes in body plan associated with shade avoidance. Experiment Overall Design: Wild type Col-0, sav3-2 and sav1-1 seedlings were used here. They were treated with or without 1hr of low R:FR light (R:FR ratio=0.7). Three independent biological replicates were used."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Joanne Chory","role":"submitter","email":"chory@salk.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":18394996,"authors":"Tao Y, Ferrer JL, Ljung K, Pojer F, Hong F, Long JA, Li L, Moreno JE, Bowman ME, Ivans LJ, Cheng Y, Lim J, Zhao Y, Ballar√© CL, Sandberg G, Noel JP, Chory J.","title":"Rapid synthesis of auxin via a new tryptophan-dependent pathway is required for shade avoidance in plants","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["7 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["sav1-1","sav3-2","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["sav1-1","sav3-2","wild type"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["continuous white light","simulated shade for 1 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":1125519,"accession":"P-G9816-4"},{"id":1125520,"accession":"P-G9816-5"},{"id":1125522,"accession":"P-G9816-2"},{"id":1125518,"accession":"P-G9816-3"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":1125521,"accession":"P-G9816-1"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
