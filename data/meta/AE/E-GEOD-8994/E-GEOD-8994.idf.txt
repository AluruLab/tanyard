Comment[Submitted Name]	A Comparison of microarray and MPSS Technology Platforms for Expression Analysis of Arabidopsis
Experiment Description	A comparison of microarray and MPSS technologies can help to establish the metrics for data comparisons across these technology platforms and determine some of the factors affecting the measurement of mRNA abundances using different platforms. Here,  different Treatments/Conditions based on different Arabidopsis tissues were used for three different platforms include MPSS, Affymetrix and Agilent. Keywords: MPSS, Affymetrix, Agilent For the comparison, 11 different samples were used: Callus, Inforescence, Leaf, Root, Silique, Afamous Inflorescence, Ap1-10 Inflorescence, Ap3-6 Inflorescence, Sup/Ap1 Inflorescence, Leaves SA 4 hr and Leaves SA 52 hr. For details about samples, see Meyers Lab (http://mpss.udel.edu/at). All RNA samples were created in Meyers Lab. MPSS experiments were performed in Meyers Lab. Affymetrix experiments were performed in St. Clair Lab (http://stclairlab.ucdavis.edu/). Agilent experiments were performed by Sean J Coughlan from Agilent (http://www.agilent.com/). Two replicates for each samples were used in Affymetrix platform except Silique sample. Two replicates for each samples were used in Agilent platform.

One ug of labeled cRNA (cy3 and cy5 labeled sample) was diluted to 175 µl and defragmented at 60°C for 30 min following the Agilent hybridization protocols (5184-3568; Agilent).

The intensities of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were normalized by comparing signal intensities of house keeping genes (positive controls) for both dyes and using the determined ratio as a correction factor for differences in labeling efficiencies(Agilent Feature Extraction v8.1 software). The genes that had valid signal in all six replicates were exported to Rosetta Resolver software, Seattle, Washington). The normalized values were used to calculate the ratio of channel intensities (Cy5/Cy3), which were then log10 transformed.

Prior to hybridizations, the quality and quantity of the total RNA sample was confirmed by running  10ng samples on an Agilent bioanalyser (RNA chip), and by using a spectrophotometer. The oligoarray hybridization experiments included six technical replicates, of which three were dye-reversal. Five hundred ng of total RNA was used as template for cRNA production and Cyanine dyes was incorporated using the Agilent low RNA input linear amp kit (5198-3523; Agilent). Normal yields from 500 ng total RNA input using a 4 h in vitro transcription were 15 ug cRNA (15 pmole cyanine dye incorporated/ug cRNA).	started with 12 μg total RNA; biotin labeling using ENZO kit
