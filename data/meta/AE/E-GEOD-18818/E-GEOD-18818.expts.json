N\/NO3- also suppresses parts of secondary metabolism including anthocyanin synthesis. Molecular components for this repression are unknown. We report that three N\/NO3--induced members of the LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY DOMAIN (LBD) gene family of transcription factors (LBD37, LBD38 and LBD39) act as negative regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Over-expression of each of the three genes in the absence of N\/NO3- strongly suppresses the key regulators of anthocyanin synthesis PAP1 and PAP2, genes in the anthocyanin-specific part of flavonoid synthesis, as well as cyanidin- but not quercetin- or kaempferol-glycoside production. Conversely, lbd37, lbd38 or lbd39 T-DNA insertion mutants accumulate anthocyanins when grown in N\/NO3--sufficient conditions and show constitutive expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. The LBD genes also repress many other known N-responsive genes including key genes required for NO3- uptake and assimilation, resulting in altered NO3- content, nitrate reductase activity\/activation, protein, amino acid and starch levels, and N-related growth phenotypes. The results identify LBD37 and its two close homologs as novel repressers of anthocyanin biosynthesis and N-availability signals in general. They also show that besides being developmental regulators LBD genes fulfill roles in metabolic regulation. We used microarrays to test whether LBD37 and LBD38 have a more widespread role in NO3-\/N-regulation. Experiment Overall Design: 9-day old Arabidopsis seedlings were harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Total RNA was prepared separately from three biological replicates of N-limited LBD37OX, LBD38OX and WT seedlings, and N-replete lbd37-1 mutant, lbd38 mutant and WT seedlings (18 samples)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Grit Rubin","role":"submitter","email":"rubin@mpimp-golm.mpg.de"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["9 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["LBD37 knockout","LBD37 overexpression","LBD38 knockout","LBD38 overexpression","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["LBD37 knockout","LBD37 overexpression","LBD38 knockout","LBD38 overexpression","wild type"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["full nitrogen","nitrogen depletion"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1125407,"accession":"P-G18818-1"},{"id":1125408,"accession":"P-G18818-2"},{"id":1125405,"accession":"P-G18818-3"},{"id":1125404,"accession":"P-G18818-4"},{"id":1125406,"accession":"P-G18818-5"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
