Protocol Description	RMA algorithm using RobinA software (PMID:22684630) ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 RMA signal	Affymetrix standard labeling protocol	Affymetrix standard hybridization protocol	Plants were harvested at 10am in the morning, 2h after the start of the day.	Plants were treated in the darkness at 5% O2 v/v in air for 4h at 10am in the morning, 2h after the start of the day	Seeds were sown in 6-cm diameter pots containing moisted Arabidopsis soil. The seeds were stratified at 4°C in the dark for 2 days and then the pots were moved in a growth chamber at short photoperiodic conditions (8h light 16 h darkness) with 18°C in the night and 22°C in the day.	Total RNA was extracted from whole 5-week old plants using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. RNA was processed for use on Affymetrix Arabidopsis Genome GeneChip arrays.	Affymetrix standard scan protocol
