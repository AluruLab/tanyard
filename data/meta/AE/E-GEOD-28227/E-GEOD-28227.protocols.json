Briefly, the total RNA was reverse transcribed to first strand cDNA with a oligo(dT) primer bearing a 5’-T7 promoter using ArrayScript reverse transcriptase.  The first strand cDNA then underwent second-strand synthesis to convert into double-stranded cDNA template for in vitro transcription.  The biotin-labeled aRNA was synthesized using T7 RNA transcriptase with biotin-NTP mix.  After purification, the aRNA was fragmented in 1X fragmentation buffer at 94 C for 35 min.","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1133222,"accession":"P-GSE28227-6","name":null,"text":"Hybridization solution containing 50 ng\/ul of fragmented aRNA was hybridized to the genome array GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at 45 C for 18 hrs.
