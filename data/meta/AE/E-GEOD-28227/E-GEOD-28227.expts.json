We compared the gene expression profiles between the double mutant erf5\/6 and WT plants in response to chitooctaose using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis Whole Genome Arrays. Both the double mutant erf5\/6 and WT plants were grown in liquid MS medium in a growth chamber with constant light. Two-week-old seedlings were treated with chitooctaose at a final concentration of 1 uM for 30 minutes. The controls were similarly treated with an equivalent amount of ddH2O. The treated seedlings were harvested for RNA isolation. Three biological replicates were conducted for the experiment."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Geon-hui Son","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Gary Stacey","role":"submitter","email":"staceyg@missouri.edu"},{"contact":"Jinrong Wan","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["14 day"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["erf5\/6 double mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedling"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["chitooctaose","none"]},{"name":"dose","value":["1 micromolar"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["erf5\/6 double mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1133219,"accession":"P-GSE28227-1"},{"id":1133226,"accession":"P-GSE28227-2"},{"id":1133220,"accession":"P-GSE28227-7"},{"id":1133221,"accession":"P-GSE28227-8"},{"id":1133223,"accession":"P-GSE28227-5"},{"id":1133222,"accession":"P-GSE28227-6"},{"id":1133225,"accession":"P-GSE28227-3"},{"id":1133224,"accession":"P-GSE28227-4"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
