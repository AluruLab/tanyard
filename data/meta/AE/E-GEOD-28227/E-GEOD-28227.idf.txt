Comment[Submitted Name]	Comparison of gene expression profiles between erf5/6 and WT Arabidopsis in response to chitooctaose							
Experiment Description	Transcription factors ERF5 and ERF6 may play a regulatory role in regulating the expression of chitin-responsive genes. We compared the gene expression profiles between the double mutant erf5/6 and WT plants in response to chitooctaose using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis Whole Genome Arrays. Both the double mutant erf5/6 and WT plants were grown in liquid MS medium in a growth chamber with constant light. Two-week-old seedlings were treated with chitooctaose at a final concentration of 1 uM for 30 minutes. The controls were similarly treated with an equivalent amount of ddH2O. The treated seedlings were harvested for RNA isolation. Three biological replicates were conducted for the experiment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = dChip expression value	Hybridization solution containing 50 ng/ul of fragmented aRNA was hybridized to the genome array GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at 45 C for 18 hrs.  After hybridization, the chips were washed and stained with R-phycoerythrin-streptavidin on Affymetrix fluidics station 450 using fluidics protocol FS450_0004.	Plants were grown in 1/2 MS medium plus vitamin B5 and 2% glucose in a growth chamber with constant light and a temperature of 23 C.	The data were analyzed with dChip (DNA-Chip Analyzer), Build date: Mar 31 2010. The default settings were employed for normalization and calculation of expression values.	The image data was acquired by the Affymetrix GeneChip scanner 3000 and Affymetrix AGCC software.	Seedlings were treated with chitooctaose at a final concentration of 1 uM for 30 minutes. The controls were similarly treated with an equivalent amount of ddH2O.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	0.5 microgram of total RNA was used to make the biotin-labeled antisense RNA (aRNA) target using the MessageAmp Premier RNA amplification kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) by following the manufacturer’s procedures.  Briefly, the total RNA was reverse transcribed to first strand cDNA with a oligo(dT) primer bearing a 5’-T7 promoter using ArrayScript reverse transcriptase.  The first strand cDNA then underwent second-strand synthesis to convert into double-stranded cDNA template for in vitro transcription.  The biotin-labeled aRNA was synthesized using T7 RNA transcriptase with biotin-NTP mix.  After purification, the aRNA was fragmented in 1X fragmentation buffer at 94 C for 35 min.
