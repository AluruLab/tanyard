Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) algorithm using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 RMA signal intensity	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol.	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	for HS groups, the treatment was 37â„ƒ for 30min	Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants of ecotype Col-0 were used for all experiments. Sterilized seeds were grown in Murashige & Skoog solid medium within glass plates. After a 72 h vernalization at 4â„ƒ in dark condition, plats were transferred to the growth camber (ambient temperature of 23â„ƒ, relative humidity of approximately 70%, and a photoperiod of 16 h light approximately 100 Î¼mol m-2s-1 alternating with 8 h darkness).	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	GeneChips were scanned by using Affymetrix® GeneChip Command Console (AGCC) which installed in GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G.
