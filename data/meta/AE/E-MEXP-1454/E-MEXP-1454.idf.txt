Protocol Description	Seeds were germinated on sterile, solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium in plastic petri dishes. Seedlings were then transferred to pots containing a mixture of Huminsubstrat N3 and Vermiculit Nr.2 (2:1 v/v) (purchased from a local supplier), and placed in a culture room with natural light (3000 lux). The photoperiod was 16 h and temperature was maintained at 23 Â°C. Single leaves were cut from the plants at a stage of approximately ten rosette leaves (>1 cm in length).	Total RNA was extracted and purified with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop ND-1000, Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 ug total RNA by using the one-cycle cDNA synthesis kit (GeneChip One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents, Affymetrix, High Wycombe, U.K.) 	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
