Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA signal intensity	The target cRNAs were fragmented, combined with hybridization and spike controls, then hybridized to the Genechip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) for 16 h. Following hybridization, the arrays were washed and stained with streptavidin phycoerythrin conjugate using an automated GeneChip® Fluidics Station 450	Arabidopsis thaliana was grown on compost in controlled conditions. 8 h day, 60 % RH, 23/18°C day/night, light intensity 200 µmol/ m2 s	Arabidopsis thaliana was grown on compost in controlled conditions. 10 h day, 60 % RH, 22 °C constant temperature, light intensity 350 µmol/ m2 s	A significance test was undertaken by calculating a null hypothesis through a permuted modified t-statistic across the replicates for each array comparison. The log2 means of the normalized intensity values of the biological replicates were compared as ratios, where a log2 ratio of ±1.0 and a p-value of < 0.05 was selected as worthy of further study.	Raw intensity values from the scanned Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays were analyzed using RMAExpress .	GeneChips were scanned with a GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G using a 570 nm excitation wavelength laser. Microarray quality controls were assessed using GeneChip® Operating Software (Affymetrix)..	Whole rosettes were harvested at the indicated stage, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.	Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol.	Double-stranded cDNA was generated from each of the ten total-RNA samples and transcribed to obtain biotin-labeled cRNA.	Double-stranded cDNA was generated from each of the seventeen total-RNA samples and transcribed to obtain biotin-labeled cRNA.
