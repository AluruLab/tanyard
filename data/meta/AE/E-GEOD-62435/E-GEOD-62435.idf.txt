Comment[Submitted Name]	Global Functional Targets of the Histone Methyltransferase SDG8 Uncover a Role for Histone Modification in Energy Metabolism									
Experiment Description	Histone methylation modulates gene expression in response to external and internal cues. We uncovered a non-redundant role for the Arabidopsis histone methyltransferase, SDG8, which provides a unique opportunity to study the global function of a specific histone methyltransferase within in a multicellular organism. We previously used a promoter responsive to light and carbon in a positive genetic screen to identify an Arabidopsis carbon and light insensitive mutant cli186.  In this study, we characterize the mutant cli186  as a complete deletion of a histone methyltransferase gene SDG8 (now renamed sdg8-5). To assess the global role of SDG8, we compared the global histone methylation patterns and the transcriptome of sdg8-5 to wild type (WT) in the context of a transient carbon and light treatment. We showed that the complete deletion of SDG8 in sdg8-5 is associated with a dramatic reduction of H3K36me3 towards the 3’ of the gene body, which correlates with significant reduction in gene expression.  We uncovered 1,084 “high confidence” functional targets of SDG8 – affected in both H3K36me3 marks and gene expression – that are associated with specific biological processes including defense, photosynthesis, nutrient metabolism and energy metabolism. Importantly, 71% of these functional targets are responsive to carbon and/or light. Our model suggests that SDG8 functions to mark specific sets of genes with H3K36me3 in the gene body for active transcription, to tune genes involved in primary metabolism that are responsive to the energy level in the environment. Wild type Arabidopisis and sdg8-5 plants were grown in hydroponics system for three weeks, then starved for carbonhydrate and light for 24 h. They were then treated with  carbon and/or light or remained untreated as controls.Three biological replicates were collected, resulting in 24 samples (2 genotypes X 2 carbonhydrate treatmens X 2 light treatments X3 biological replicates).

Protocol Description	The raw CEL files were normalized using MAS5 package in the R environment (http://www.r-project.org/). A low expression level cutoff of 40 was applied to remove probes with extremely low expression level across all conditions, while most (21553/22810) probes were kept for the following statistical tests. A three-way ANOVA was performed to dissect the gene expression variation as caused by genotype, light, carbon, genotype×light, genotype×carbon, light×carbon, and three way interaction genotype×light×carbon in R. The raw p-value from the ANOVA was then adjusted for multi-testing error with FDR correction in R. The FDR adjusted p-value was then used to select probes that are significantly affected by single factors, a binary interaction of two factors, or an interaction of all three factors using an FDR cutoff 0.05. Only unambiguous probes mapped to single gene were used. ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5 normalized expression value.	The Affymetrix one-cycle cDNA synthesis kit was used to synthesize double stranded cDNA from 1μg of total RNA. The cDNA was cleaned using the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix#900371) and followed by Biotin-labeling of the cRNA using the 3’ amplification reagent for IVT labeling (Affymetrix). The concentration and quality of cRNA was checked through an A260/280 nm by using the nanodrop.	8 μg of cRNA was used to hybridize the GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 genome array (from Affymetrix) at 42�C for 16 hours. Following the hybridization, the chips had been washed and stained by following Affymetrix protocol.	After 3 weeks, the plants were starved in liquid basal MS medium (GIBCO Formula# 97-5068EC) supplemented with 0% sucrose and 2 mM KNO3 at a pH of 5.7 and the phytatrays were covered with aluminum foil (for light starvation) for 24 hours. Plants were then treated with +/- 1% Sucrose and +/- Light (70 uEin m-2s-1) for 2 hours.	WT and sdg8-5 (previously named cli186) seeds were surface sterilized and imbibed in darkness for 2 days. Plants were then grown hydroponically inside a sterile Phytatray (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) on liquid Basal MS medium (GIBCO Formula# 97-5068EC) supplemented with 1% sucrose and 2 mM KNO3 at a pH of 5.7. The phytatrays were kept under white light (50 uE m-2s-1) in long-day cycle (16h Light/8h Dark) at 220C for 3 weeks (when they start flowering).	Shoots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. RNA (3 sets of biological replicates) was isolated using RNeasy plant mini-kit (Cat# 74904) from Qiagen.	The microarrays were scanned using a GeneChip Scanner (Affymetrix).
