A low expression level cutoff of 40 was applied to remove probes with extremely low expression level across all conditions, while most (21553\/22810) probes were kept for the following statistical tests. A three-way ANOVA was performed to dissect the gene expression variation as caused by genotype, light, carbon, genotype×light, genotype×carbon, light×carbon, and three way interaction genotype×light×carbon in R. The raw p-value from the ANOVA was then adjusted for multi-testing error with FDR correction in R. The FDR adjusted p-value was then used to select probes that are significantly affected by single factors, a binary interaction of two factors, or an interaction of all three factors using an FDR cutoff 0.05. Only unambiguous probes mapped to single gene were used.
