Experiment Description	Arabidopsis plants growing under diurnal conditions were transferred to cold of approximately one day duration, starting at different times of the day. All comparisons are of unreplicated pairs and are thus not designed to identify cold-responsive gens in isolation but are rather to supplement existing publicly available data. The overall aim was to use a diverse set of experiments to see which factors have the greatest influence on the identity of cold-responsive genes.

Protocol Description	Columbia (Col-0-G1) was initially soil grown for 4 weeks in short-days (8 h) before transfer to long-days (16 h) at a day/night air temperature of 20 °C/18 °C and 150 µmol m-2 s-1 light. Experiments were started when the rosette was mature (40-45 days after germination) and completed before the inflorescence reached 0.5-2cm. Experiments [treatments] were started at different times of the day as indicated by the hours after dawn [zeitgeber time (ZT)] in the sample name. The time of day of harvest can be calculated by adding the treatment duration to this ZT.	Nonacclimated control plants were transferred to a 4°C growth chamber with a 16 h photoperiod at 90 µmol m-2 s-1 for a specified period of time as indicated be the hours in the sample name. Treatments started at different times of the day as indicated by the zeitgeber time (ZT) in the sample name. 	Whole rosettes were pooled from 5 or 6 individual plants before extracting RNA.
