All comparisons are of unreplicated pairs and are thus not designed to identify cold-responsive gens in isolation but are rather to supplement existing publicly available data. The overall aim was to use a diverse set of experiments to see which factors have the greatest influence on the identity of cold-responsive genes."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Matt A Hannah","role":"submitter","email":"hannah@mpimp-golm.mpg.de"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":18375597,"authors":"Bieniawska Z, Espinoza C, Schlereth A, Sulpice R, Hincha DK, Hannah MA","title":"Disruption of the Arabidopsis circadian clock is responsible for extensive variation in the cold-responsive transcriptome","pages":"pp.108.118059v1","publication":"Plant Physiol","volume":"NA","year":2008,"status":"journal_article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1104\/pp.108.118059"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":[42]},{"category":"BioSourceType","value":["frozen_sample"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia-0 G1"]},{"category":"InitialTimePoint","value":["germination"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["rosette"]},{"category":"TimeUnit","value":["days"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"length of treatment","value":["22 h","26 h"]},{"name":"temperature","value":["20 degree_C","4 degree_C"]},{"name":"time at start of treatment","value":["treatment started at ZT14","treatment started at ZT2"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":482384,"accession":"P-MEXP-114537"},{"id":57,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4_450"},{"id":77,"accession":"P-AFFY-2"},{"id":235758,"accession":"  "},{"id":80632,"accession":"P-MEXP-114017"},{"id":80634,"accession":"P-MEXP-114016"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":80631,"accession":"P-MEXP-114540"},{"id":80630,"accession":"P-MEXP-114656"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
