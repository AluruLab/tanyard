Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown for 7 d at 16-h photoperiod on the 3MM Whatman filter paper on top of the agar plate containing 0.5x Murashige Skoog (MS) media salts with vitamins, 1.5% sucrose, 2.5 mM Mes, pH 5.7, and 0.8% phytoagar at 23 C	The filter paper with the seedlings was then transferred to the plate containing plant hormone or chemicals at 20 uM for IAA or 10 uM for DEX or 50 uM cycloheximide, and incubated for a given period of time with gentle shaking in the light at 23 C.	Total RNA was isolated from young seedlings with an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). Five micrograms of RNA were used to make biotin-labeled cRNA products.  	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
