Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of young inflorescences of AP1âˆ·AtIPT4 Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic plants to identify the candidate genes responsive to cytokinin			
Experiment Description	The aim of this experiment is to identify the candidate genes responsive to cytokinin in Arabidopsis floral development. For this purpose, AtIPT4 gene under the control of the AP1 promoter was transformed into wild type plants of Arabidopsis. The transcriptional profiles of the young inflorescence of AP1::AtIPT4 transformants and wild-type plants are compared.

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-5342	P-MTAB-5343	P-MTAB-5344	
Protocol Description	Total RNA was isolated from the young inflorescences at around 5 mm height with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	The data per chip were analyzed with GeneSpring 7.31 (Agilent) using the default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 500.	Plants were grown on soil for two weeks under short day conditions (10 hr light/14 hr darkness, 20-21C), and then shifted to long day conditions (16 hr light/8 hr darkness, 20-21C) to induce flowering. <br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)
