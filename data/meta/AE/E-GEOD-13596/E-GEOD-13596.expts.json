We used ap1-1;cal1-1 mutant background to enrich the sufficient number of cells for microarray analysis. Spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression is critical for stem-cell homeostasis. The shoot apical meristems of Arabidopsis thaliana harbor a small set of stem-cells which are surrounded by several million differentiating cells, imposing a severe limitation on the genomic analyses of stem-cell homeostasis. We have employed cell type-specific gene expression profiling that allowed us to generate a high-resolution gene expression map and it has revealed gene expression networks specific to the cell types of the stem-cell niche. We demonstrate that the expression map can be used to predict in vivo gene expression domains to identify novel gene expression patterns. Furthermore, it has revealed molecular pathways that are conserved among plant and animal stem-cell populations. The expression map should guide future reverse genetics experiments, high-resolution analyses of cell-cell communication networks and epigenetic modifications. Experiment Overall Design: Three replicates were used CLV3p, CLV3n and FILp, while for WUSp only two replicates were used. CLV3n cells lacks CLV3p cell type."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Venu Reddy","role":"submitter","email":"ryadav@ucr.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19258454,"authors":"Ram Kishor Yadav, Thomas Girke, Sumana Pasala, Mingtang Xie, G Venugopala Reddy","title":"Gene expression map of the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem stem cell niche.","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0900843106","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Genotype","value":["ap1-1;cal1-1"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["shoot apical meristem"]},{"category":"Phenotype","value":["GFP negative","pCLV3::mGFP5-ER negative","pCLV3::mGFP5-ER positive","pFIL::dsRED-N7 positive","pWUS::mGFP5-ER positive"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"PHENOTYPE","value":["GFP negative","pCLV3::mGFP5-ER negative","pCLV3::mGFP5-ER positive","pFIL::dsRED-N7 positive","pWUS::mGFP5-ER positive"]},{"name":"TREATMENT","value":["none","protoplasting"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":15,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":451783,"accession":"P-G13596-3"},{"id":451781,"accession":"P-G13596-2"},{"id":451782,"accession":"P-G13596-1"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":15,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":15,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
