Investigation Title	Expression data from aerial parts of 14-day-old wild-type and GFP-TIE1-15 Arabidopsis seedlings							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from aerial parts of 14-day-old wild-type and GFP-TIE1-15 Arabidopsis seedlings
Experiment Description	TIE1 regulates leaf development by repressing leaf differentiation because the semi-dominant mutant tie1-D by activation tagging displays small and hyponastic leaves and the differentiation of leaf epidermal cells is delayed in the tie1-D mutant, whereas disruption of TIE1 causes epinastic leaves with early differentiated epidermal cells. We used microarrays to investigate the molecular base underpinning the phenotypes of TIE1-overexpressing plants. Aerial parts of 14-day-old seedlings from wild-type and GFP-TIE1-15 were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Protocol Name	P-GSE38282-1	P-GSE38282-6	P-GSE38282-3	P-GSE38282-8	P-GSE38282-7	P-GSE38282-2	P-GSE38282-4	P-GSE38282-5
Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays. The standard wash and double-stain protocols (EukGE-WS2v5-450) were applied using an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450.	Arabidopsis seeds from wild-type and GFP-TIE1-15 were placed on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (1/2 MS) medium. The plates were put in 4 °C refrigerator for 3 days to complete synchronization before being placed at 22±2 °C under long day conditions (16-h light and 8-h dark) for 14 days.	The scanned arrays were analyzed first with Affymetrix GCOS 1.0 (MAS 5.0) software to generate detection calls. Both data sets were normalized using Affymetrix GCOS software, and the TGT value was set to 100.	The arrays were scanned on an Affymetrix GeneChip scanner 3000.	Aerial parts of the 14-day-old seedlings were excised from the seedlings and collected for total RNA extraction.	The QIAgen RNeasy Total RNA Extraction Kit was used to extract total RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotin-labeled cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
