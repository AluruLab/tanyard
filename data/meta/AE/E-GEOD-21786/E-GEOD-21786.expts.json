The latest acting bHLH in the stomatal lineage circuit is FAMA that appears to be absolutely required to promote stomatal development by controlling the GMC to GC transition. In order for FAMA to trigger guard cell development, it probably initiates a gene activation cascade leading to cell differentiation and cessation of cell division. To identify and characterize FAMA inducible genes, transcriptome analysis using the Affymetrix ATH1 micro-array chip was carried out on inducible FAMA gain of function plants at 4hrs and 48 hrs post-induction. Transgenic plants with an estrogen-inducible FAMA expression cassette were used in a timecourse experiment to identify genes that were differentially regulated by FAMA. Two time points were analyzed, 4 hours and 48 hours post-induction. Seedlings were grown on vertically oriented plates in a 22 °C incubator under 24 hours light for 5 days. Plants were then transfered with forcepts to plates containing MS + Sucrose + 10 µM estrogen (or new MS + sucrose plates for controls). After 4h or 48h on new plates, samples were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 degree until enough material was obtained to do all RNA extractions in the same week. The Rneasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) for RNA isolation, and samples were labelled with standard kits, etc (get info) and hybridized to Affymetrix Ath1 array chips. 15 samples."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Dominique C Bergmann","role":"submitter","email":"dbergmann@stanford.edu"},{"contact":"Kyoko Ohashi-Ito","role":null,"email":"kyoko@biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["5 day","7 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"age","value":["5 day","7 day"]},{"name":"hours post induction","value":["4 hour","48 hour"]},{"name":"treatment","value":["estrogen induction","estrogen induction of FAMA-EAR construct","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":15,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1128072,"accession":"P-GSE21786-8"},{"id":1128074,"accession":"P-GSE21786-7"},{"id":1128073,"accession":"P-GSE21786-6"},{"id":1128075,"accession":"P-GSE21786-5"},{"id":1128076,"accession":"P-GSE21786-4"},{"id":1128078,"accession":"P-GSE21786-3"},{"id":1128077,"accession":"P-GSE21786-2"},{"id":1128071,"accession":"P-GSE21786-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":15,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":15,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
