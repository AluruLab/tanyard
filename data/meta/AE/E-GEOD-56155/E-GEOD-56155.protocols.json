Plants were grown under long day conditions—16 hr light (100-125 μmol m-2 s-1):8 hr dark. Above-ground portions of seedlings were harvested when the first two leaf primordia were 1 mm in length, which was at day 7 for wild-type seedlings and day 9 for the two mutants. Only seedlings that produced cotyledons and leaf primordia were used. 75-100 seedlings were used per biological replicate.","type":"growth protocol","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1169441,"accession":"P-GSE56155-4","name":null,"text":"The seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and then Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with a mortar and pestle.

The RNA was further purified according to the RNeasy Mini directions, including an on-column DNA digestion with Qiagen’s RNase-Free DNase Set.
