We have previously shown that two components of the Mediator CDK8 module, CENTER CITY (CCT\/MED12) and GRAND CENTRAL (GCT\/MED13), are required for timing of pattern formation during embryogenesis in Arabidopsis. Here, we performed global gene expression analyses of wild-type, cct-1, and gct-2 seedlings (above-ground portions only) to help analyze their post-embryonic phenotypes.  Our results suggest that MED12 and MED13 act as global regulators of developmental timing by fine-tuning expression of temporal regulatory genes. Seeds of wild-type Col-0, cct-1, and gct-2 were sown in Fafard #2 soil.  Seedlings (above-ground portions only) were harvested when the first two leaf primordia were 1 mm in length, which was at day 7 for wild-type seedlings and day 9 for the two mutants. 75-100 seedlings were used for each of three biological replicates."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Matthew R Willmann","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Matthew R Willmann","role":"submitter","email":"willmann@sas.upenn.edu"},{"contact":"R S Poethig","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"C S Gillmor","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":25377553,"authors":"Gillmor CS, Silva-Ortega CO, Willmann MR, Buend√≠a-Monreal M, Poethig RS.","title":"The Arabidopsis Mediator CDK8 module genes CCT (MED12) and GCT (MED13) are global regulators of developmental phase transitions.","doi":"10.1242\/dev.111229"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["7 day","9 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["cct-1","gct-2","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["aerial part"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["cct-1","gct-2","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1169443,"accession":"P-GSE56155-3"},{"id":1169442,"accession":"P-GSE56155-2"},{"id":1169437,"accession":"P-GSE56155-1"},{"id":1169438,"accession":"P-GSE56155-7"},{"id":1169439,"accession":"P-GSE56155-6"},{"id":1169440,"accession":"P-GSE56155-5"},{"id":1169441,"accession":"P-GSE56155-4"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
