Some of the effects are genetically-mediated and are reported to involve G-protein signaling pathways.  Effects of ozone on gene expression were examined in wild-type and G-protein null mutants to determine affected genes and to determine differential responses that may help define affected pathways. We used microarrays to examine changes in gene expression in response to ozone exposure and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes in wild-type and G-protein null mutant genotypes. Columbia wild-type and G-protein null mutant gpa1-4\/agb1-2 plants were exposed to 5 or 125 ppb ozone in controlled environment chambers for two days.  Leaves were sampled after 3 h and 2 d of exposure to examine early and late gene expression changes."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Fitzgerald L Booker","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Alan Jones","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Fitzgerald Lewis Booker","role":"submitter","email":"fitz.booker@ars.usda.gov"},{"contact":"Kent O Burkey","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21988569,"authors":"Booker F, Burkey K, Morgan P, Fiscus E, Jones A","title":"Minimal influence of G-protein null mutations on ozone-induced changes in gene expression, foliar injury, gas exchange and peroxidase activity in Arabidopsis thaliana L.","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-3040.2011.02443.x"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genetic modification","value":["gene knock out","none"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["gpa1-4, agb1-2 double mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"environmental stress","value":["control","ozone"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["G-protein knockout mutant","wild type"]},{"name":"time","value":["3 hour","48 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":27,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1169246,"accession":"P-GSE34667-7"},{"id":1169248,"accession":"P-GSE34667-6"},{"id":1169247,"accession":"P-GSE34667-8"},{"id":1169252,"accession":"P-GSE34667-3"},{"id":1169251,"accession":"P-GSE34667-2"},{"id":1169249,"accession":"P-GSE34667-5"},{"id":1169250,"accession":"P-GSE34667-4"},{"id":1169245,"accession":"P-GSE34667-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":27,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":27,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":27,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":27,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":27,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":27,"isderived":0}]}]}}
