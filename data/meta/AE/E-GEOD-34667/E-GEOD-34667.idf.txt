Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from ozone-treated wild-type and G-protein null mutant Arabidopsis lines							
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis G-protein knockout plants in response to ozone 							
Experiment Description	Ozone pollution decreases plant growth and yield worldwide.  Some of the effects are genetically-mediated and are reported to involve G-protein signaling pathways.  Effects of ozone on gene expression were examined in wild-type and G-protein null mutants to determine affected genes and to determine differential responses that may help define affected pathways. We used microarrays to examine changes in gene expression in response to ozone exposure and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes in wild-type and G-protein null mutant genotypes. Columbia wild-type and G-protein null mutant gpa1-4/agb1-2 plants were exposed to 5 or 125 ppb ozone in controlled environment chambers for two days.  Leaves were sampled after 3 h and 2 d of exposure to examine early and late gene expression changes.

Protocol Name	P-GSE34667-1	P-GSE34667-6	P-GSE34667-3	P-GSE34667-8	P-GSE34667-7	P-GSE34667-2	P-GSE34667-4	P-GSE34667-5
Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = rma normalized	Fragmented aRNA (15 ug) was added to a hybridization cocktail (0.05 ug ul-1 fragmented cRNA, 50 pM control oligonucleotide B2, BioB, BioC, BioD and cre hybridization controls, 0.1 mg ml-1 herring sperm DNA, 0.5 mg ml-1 acetylated BSA, 100 mM MES, 1 M [Na+], 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% Tween 20). aRNA (10 ug) was used for hybridization in a volume of 200 ul per slide. Affymetrix arrays were hybridized for 16 h at 45 uC in a GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix).	Columbia wild-type and G-protein null mutant gpa1-4/agb1-2 plants sown in Metro-Mix were germinated under a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 400 umol m-2 s-1 (9 h light/15 h dark cycle) at 23 C in a growth chamber in the North Carolina State University Phytotron. Plants were grown for 4-5 weeks in the growth chamber. Plants were fertilized with Phytotron nutrient solution (Downs & Thomas, 1983) once per week.	Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software was used for washing, scanning and basic analysis. Affymetrix Expression Console software processed the CEL files. The software uses the RMA algorithm.	GeneChips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G Plus.	For ozone treatments, plants were transferred to four chambers located in a walk-in growth chamber in the North Carolina State University Phytotron. Temperature, relative humidity (RH) and PPFD in the chambers were 24 C, 53% and 362 Î¼mol m-2 s-1, respectively. Plants were treated with either 5 or 125 ppb ozone for 7 h per day for two days. Leaf tissue samples from mid-whorl leaves were taken after ozone exposure for 3 h and 2 d, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis.	Extraction of total RNA was performed using Qiagen RNeasy mini kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.	The MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced Kit (Ambion, Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, CA) was used to generate biotinylated aRNA from the cDNA reaction.
