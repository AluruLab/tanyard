Investigation Title	Expression profiling of Arabidopsis wild type Col-0 and pmr5 mutant							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression profiling of Arabidopsis wild type Col-0 and pmr5 mutant							
Experiment Description	The rosettes from genotype Col-0 and pmr5 mutant were collected for RNA expression profiling when the plants were 3 weeks old. The rosettes were collected when the plants were 3 weeks old for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA normalized log2 expression	Following fragmentation, 15 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45 C on GeneChip ATH1 Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	The plants were grown at 22 C with 14 hrs photoperiod	Log2 (expression values) were extracted using robust multi-array analysis (RMA) implemented in the function rma() in the Bioconductor software package affy.	GeneChips were scanned using the Agilent GeneArray Scanner 2500.	no treatment before collection	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 15 ug total RNA.
