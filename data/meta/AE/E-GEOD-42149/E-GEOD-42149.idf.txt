Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis grown in perlite and compost
Experiment Description	Composts are the products obtained after the aerobic degradation of different types of organic matter wastes and can be used as substrates or substrate/soil amendments. There are a small but increasing number of reports that suggest that foliar diseases may be reduced when using compost as growing medium compared to standard substrates. The purpose of this study was to unravel the gene expression alteration produced by the compost to gain knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the compost-induced systemic resistance. A compost from olive marc and olive tree leaves was able to induce resistance against Botrytis cinerea in Arabidopsis compared to the standard substrate perlite. Microarray analyses revealed that 178 genes were differently expressed with a fold change cut off of 1 from which 155 were upregulated and 23 were down regulated in compost-grown compared to perlite-grown plants. Functional enrichment study of up regulated genes revealed that 38 Gene Ontology terms were significantly enriched.  Response to stress, biotic stimulus, other organism, bacterium, fungus, chemical and abiotic stimulus, SA and ABA stimulus, oxidative stress, water, temperature and cold were significantly enriched terms as well as immune and defense responses, systemic acquired resistance, secondary metabolic process and oxireductase activity. Interestingly, PR1 expression, which was equally enhanced by growing the plants in compost and by B. cinerea inoculation, was further boosted in compost-grown pathogen-inoculated plants.  Compost triggered a plant response that shares similarities with both systemic acquired resistance and ABA dependent/independent abiotic stress responses. Global gene expression of plants grown in compost (3 biological replicates) versus plants grown in perlite (2 biological replicates) was studied.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 RMA	Each sample was hybridized to a GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array (Affymetrix).	Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants were grown in perlite trays in a growth chamber at 22ºC, 70% RH and 8 h/day of 110 µmol m-2 s-1 PPFD. 17 days later, plants were transplanted to individual 60-mL pots containing either OMC or perlite and were maintained until they were 5 weeks old. The plants were watered with half-strength Hoagland solution every other day.	CEL files were generated from DAT files using GCOS software (Affymetrix). To generate the log2 expression estimates, overall array intensity was normalized between arrays and the probe intensity of all probes in a probe set summarized to a single value using RMA (Robust Multichip Average) algorithm	Arrays were scanned in a GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). CEL files were generated from DAT files using GCOS software (Affymetrix).	Perlite and olive marc compost (OMC) were used as substrates. OMC was produced at the University of Seville (Spain) starting from a 1:1.125 mixture of olive marc and olive tree leaves composted in piles for 19 weeks and then matured for one year.	RNA was extracted from samples ground under liquid nitrogen using SpeedTools Total RNA Extraction kit (Biotools, Madrid, Spain), according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.	cDNA library preparation and amplification were performed from 25ng total RNA using WTA2 (Sigma-Aldrich) with 17cycles of amplification. 8µg cDNA were subsequently fragmented by DNAseI and biotinylated by terminal transferase obtained from GeneChip Mapping 10Kv2 Assay Kit (Affymetrix).
