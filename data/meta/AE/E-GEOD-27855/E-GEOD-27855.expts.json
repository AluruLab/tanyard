We used microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed in EST-inducible EBE over-expression line #14 compared to wild-type plants, 45 min after 2µM EST induction. Three independent biological replications were performed. In order to identify potential direct\/early target genes of EBE transcription factor, estradiol inducible overexpression system was used. Three week old Arabidopsis EBE-XVE (line 14) and WT seedlings were treated with ß-estradiol (2µM) for 45 min. RNA was isolated from shoot and subjected to hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Experiment was performed in 3 biological replications and genes differentially expressed between estradiol treated EBE-XVE and WT plants were identified as potential early targets of EBE."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Mohammad Mehrnia","role":"submitter","email":"mehrnia@mpimp-golm.mpg.de"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23616605,"authors":"Mehrnia M, Balazadeh S, Zanor MI, Mueller-Roeber B.","title":"EBE, an AP2\/ERF transcription factor highly expressed in proliferating cells, affects shoot architecture in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1104\/pp.113.214049"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["3 week"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["EBE-XVE","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["shoot"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["EBE-XVE","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1174177,"accession":"P-GSE27855-1"},{"id":1174183,"accession":"P-GSE27855-2"},{"id":1174184,"accession":"P-GSE27855-3"},{"id":1174182,"accession":"P-GSE27855-4"},{"id":1174181,"accession":"P-GSE27855-5"},{"id":1174180,"accession":"P-GSE27855-6"},{"id":1174178,"accession":"P-GSE27855-7"},{"id":1174179,"accession":"P-GSE27855-8"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
