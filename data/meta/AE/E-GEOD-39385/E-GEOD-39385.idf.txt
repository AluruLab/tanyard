Investigation Title	The AtGenExpress: hormone inhibitor or other chemical treatment of seedlings in Arabidopsis							
Comment[Submitted Name]	The AtGenExpress: hormone inhibitor or other chemical treatment of seedlings in Arabidopsis
Experiment Description	Arabidopsis seedlings of the wild-type were treated with inhibitors. 60 samples were analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip, ATH1. Sample correspondence between control (mock) and inhibitor treatment is described in brackets (F series or G series).

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5<br>ABS_CALL = <br>Detection p-value = 	Affymetrix standard protocol	Seedlings were grown for 7 days at 23 degrees.	MAS5.0	Affymetrix Gene Array Scanner 2500A with the original setting (This means that scanning steps are conducted at a high level of sensitivity to focus on those genes that function in hormone signaling, because their transcripts are relatively less abundant. Under these conditions, signals of highly abundant transcripts may reach saturation)	Seedlings were treated with an inhibitor for 3 h or 12h.	guanidine-hydrochloride method	One-cycle target labeling reagents (Affymetrix)
