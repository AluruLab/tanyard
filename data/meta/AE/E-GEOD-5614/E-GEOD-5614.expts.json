Seeds of B. oleracea (var. alboglabra, A12dH) were first washed in 70% (v\/v) ethanol\/water, rinsed in distilled water and surface sterilised using 50% (v\/v) domestic bleach\/water. Seeds were rinsed and imbibed for 3 to 5 days in sterile distilled water at 4°C to break dormancy. Following imbibition, B. oleracea seeds were sown in un-vented, polycarbonate culture boxes (Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd., Dorset UK). Seedlings were grown for 21 days on perforated polycarbonate discs (diameter 91 mm by 5 mm) placed on 75 ml of 0.8% (w\/v) agar containing 1% (w\/v) sucrose and a basal salt mix. Roots grew into the agar, but shoots remained on the opposite side of the disc. After 21 days, seedlings were transferred, still on polycarbonate discs, to a hydroponics system situated in a Saxcil growth cabinet (16 h daylength, set to 22°C and 80% humidity). Each polycarbonate disc was placed on a light-proof 500 ml beaker over 450 ml of nutrient solution. After 7 days, half the plants were transferred to nutrient solution containing no phosphate and the other half remained on full nutrient solution (control plants). Shoots were harvested 100 h after the withdrawal of P. !Samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol extraction method and cleaned through a Qiagen RNeasy column.
