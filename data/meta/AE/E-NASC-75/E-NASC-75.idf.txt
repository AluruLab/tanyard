Experiment Description	In Arabidopsis thaliana, the immediate early response of plants to cytokinin is formulated as the multistep AHK-AHP-ARR phosphorelay signaling circuitry, which is initiated by the cytokinin-receptor histidine protein kinases. In the hope of finding components (or genes) that function downstream of the cytokinin-mediated His-Asp phosphorelay signaling circuitry, we carried out genome-wide microarray analyses. To this end, we focused on a pair of highly homologous ARR10 and ARR12 genes by constructing an arr10 arr12 double null mutant. The mutant alleles used in this study were arr10-5 and arr12-1. arr10-5 is the SALK_098604 T-DNA insertion line, whose mutation was determined to be located in the fifth exon of the ARR10 coding sequence. Arr12-1 is the SALK_054752 T-DNA insertion line, whose mutation was determined to be located in the third exon of the ARR12 coding sequence. The resulting mutant exhibits a characteristic phenotype with regard to the cytokinin-mediated His-Asp phosphorelay. Here we, therefore, compared response to cytokinin in wild type with that in arr10 arr12 double mutant. In this study, wild type and the arr10 arr12 double mutant grown vertically on MS agar plates for 2 weeks were treated with 20uM t-zeatin or 0.02% DMSO (solvent for t-zetion solution) for 1h. These treated plant samples were divided into three portions, from which RNA samples were prepared separately from aerial parts of seedlings with use of RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, U.S.A.). The Quality of RNAs prepared was analyzed by Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). These RNA samples were processed as recommended by the Affymetrix instruction (Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, Affymetrix). These dataset will provide us with bases for understanding the early response to cytokinin on aerial parts of seedlings in Arabidopsis thaliana.

Protocol Description	Growth conditions	The Arabidopsis were treated with 20 uM trans-zeatin by spraying for 1h	Protocol: Seedlings harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA extracted as described in the Qiagen RNAeasy kit. 	RNA samples were quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 100 pmol T7-(dT)24 primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3')  was hybridized with the Total RNA ( 8 - 12ug) at 70 Â°C for 10 minutes. First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM ÃÂ-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.
