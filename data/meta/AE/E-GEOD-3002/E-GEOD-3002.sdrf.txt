GSE3002GSM65296	Arabidopsis thaliana	EFO	http://purl.org/obo/owl/NCBITaxon#NCBITaxon_3702	Dark grown seedlings, Ecotype: columbia. Alleles phyA-211 and phyB-9:  For more information see Mazzella et al, 2005. Plant Cell Vol 17 (september). phyA phyB double mutants seeds were sown on 0.8% (w/v) agar in clear plastic boxes and incubated at 6 degrees for 5 d. Chilled seeds were exposed to 1 h of white light at 22 degrees to induce homogeneous seed germination. After 3 d in full D at 22 degrees seedlings were harvested in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted by using the RNEASY Plant mini kit (Qiagen).
