Experiment Description	By reciprocally crossing 2x and 4x C24 ecotype plants, we have generated 4 types of offspring with various ploidy (2x; 3x; 4x) or parent-of-origin genome dosage (3x from 4xper2x; 3x from 2xper4x). For each offspring generated, total RNA was extracted using Trizol from 8 seedlings 9 days after germination (developmental stage1.02, 2 leaves). Sample names:; DIP diploid; TET tetraploid; TFE triploid female excess; TME triplod male excess; Experimenter name: Olivier Garnier; Experimenter phone: 00-353-21-490-4028; Experimenter address: Plant molecular genetics lab, Dpt of Biochemistry, UCC; Experimenter address: Lee Maltings Prospect row; Experimenter zip/postal_code: Cork; Experimenter country: Ireland Experiment Overall Design: 11 samples were used in this experiment
