Seed sterilisation was performed in 15 ml Falcon tubes. Seeds were washed in 70% ethanol for 5 minutes with shaking. The tubes were centrifuged and the ethanol replaced with freshly-prepared 50% sodium hypochlorite solution (BDH; available chlorine %), and the tubes were shaken for 10 minutes. The seeds were pelleted by centrifugation, the bleach solution replaced with sterile pure water, and the tubes shaken vigorously. The seeds were pelleted again and the rinsing was repeated twice more. To spread the seed evenly on MS agar plates, the sterilised seeds were resuspended in sterile 0.1% agar and transferred by pipette on to 10 cm square plates. The plates were shaken gently to disperse the seed\/agar suspension. Growth Room Agar 0.7% Agar was added to a concentration of 0.7% (w\/v) agar and the medium was autoclaved at 121 deg.
