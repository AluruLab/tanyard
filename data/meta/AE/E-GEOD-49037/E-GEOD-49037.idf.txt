Investigation Title	WRKY6 Transcription Factor Restricts Arsenate Uptake and Transposon Activation in Arabidopsis																		
Comment[Submitted Name]	WRKY6 Transcription Factor Restricts Arsenate Uptake and Transposon Activation in Arabidopsis
Experiment Description	Stress constantly challenges plant adaptation to the environment.  Of all stress types, arsenic was a major threat during the early evolution of plants.  The most prevalent chemical form of arsenic is arsenate, whose similarity to phosphate renders it easily incorporated into cells via the phosphate transporters.  Here we found that arsenate stress provokes a notable transposon burst in plants, in coordination with arsenate/phosphate transporter repression, which immediately restricts arsenate uptake.  This repression was accompanied by delocalization of the phosphate transporter from the plasma membrane.  When arsenate was removed, the system rapidly restored transcriptional expression and membrane localization of the transporter.  We identify WRKY6 as an arsenate-responsive transcription factor that mediates arsenate/phosphate transporter gene expression and restricts arsenate-induced transposon activation.  Plants therefore have a dual WRKY-dependent signaling mechanism that modulates arsenate uptake and transposon expression, providing a coordinated strategy for arsenate tolerance and transposon gene silencing. Three biological replicates were performed for each sample type. Single channel hybridizations were carried-out using either Affymetrix ATH1 platform or Nimblegen Gene Expression 12x135K platform (Arabidopsis thaliana).

Protocol Description	Data were analyzed through Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA) with Nimblegen Scan software (Roche). ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA-normalized log signal	Analysis was performed using the affylmaGUI R package (Wettenhall et al, 2006). Robust Muti-array Analysis (RMA) algorithm was used for background correction, normalization and expression levels summarization (Irizarry et al., 2003). ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA-normalized log signal	cDNA was Cy3-labeled with the Nimblegen One-Color DNA Labeling Kit (Roche).	cDNA was synthesized from 4 µg of total RNA using One-cycle target labeling and control reagents(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) to produce biotin-labeled cRNA. The cRNA preparations (15 µg) were fragmented at 94ºC for 35 min into 35-200 bases in length.	Each microarray was hybridized with the Nimblegen Hybridization Kit, washed using the Nimblegen Wash Buffer Kit (both from Roche) and scanned at 2 Î¼m double-pass at 16 bit of resolution.	10µg of fragmented cRNA were hybridized to the Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome array (Affymetrix, SantaClara, CA). Each sample was added to a hybridization solution containing 100mM2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, 1M Na+,and 20mM of EDTA in the presence of 0.01% of Tween-20 to a final cRNA concentration of 0.05µg/ml. Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 45ºC . Each microarray was washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin in a Fluidics station 450 (Affymetrix).	Plants were transferred to liquid medium supplemented with 30 Î¼M As(V), 30 Î¼M Pi, 1mM Pi (or not supplemented) for indicated times.	Plants were grown on Johnson medium with 1 mM Pi (7 days), transferred to -Pi medium (2 days).	RNA was isolated from three independent biological samples for each condition using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Each RNA preparation was tested for degradation using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent technologies, Palo Alto, CA).	Scanned at 2 Î¼m double-pass at 16 bit of resolution with the official Nimblegen scanner.	Each microarray was scanned at 2.5 µm resolution in a GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G System (Affymetrix)
