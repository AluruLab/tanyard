Investigation Title	Epigenetic mutant gene expression analysis_2					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Epigenetic mutant gene expression analysis_2					
Experiment Description	The aim of this project is to identify endogenous targets of yet unidentified epigenetic mutants. Mutants were discovered in a forward genetic approach using T-DNA insertion mutagenesis. Pools of 25 seedlings, grown in-vitro, will be used to examine changes in gene expression. 9 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	Labelled using protocol described in manual &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual&quot;, One-Cycle target labelling	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
