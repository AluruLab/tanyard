Investigation Title	Response of clavata 2-7 mutant to Ralstonia solanacearum.
Comment[Submitted Name]	Response of clavata 2-7 mutant to Ralstonia solanacearum.
Experiment Description	In this experiment, we compared transcriptome of one knock out mutants in the CLV2 gene (clv2-7) to his wild type Col-0 when challenged with the virulent GMI1000 strain of Ralstonia solanacearum. This mutant shows a significant delay of symptom appearance. The experiment was conducted on roots and leaves of 4 week old plants harvested at the time of inoculation and when the first symptoms appeared on the susceptible wild type (4 days after inoculation - 25% of wilted leaves: disease index 1, D1).
