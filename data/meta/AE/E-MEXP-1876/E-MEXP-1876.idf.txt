Experiment Description	The Arabidopsis thaliana NAC domain transcription factor, VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN7 (VND7), acts as a master regulator for differentiation of xylem vessels. In order to identify a set of genes regulated by VND7, we carried out a microarray experiment with the Arabidopsis full-genome GeneChip array ATH1 (Affymetrix) for transgenic Arabidopsis roots overexpressing VND7. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNAs were isolated from roots of 5-day-old seedling of transgenic plants overexpressing YFP and VND7-YFP under control of Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Three independent biological replicates were performed for each sample.
