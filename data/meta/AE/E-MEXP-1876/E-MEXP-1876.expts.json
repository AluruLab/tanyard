In order to identify a set of genes regulated by VND7, we carried out a microarray experiment with the Arabidopsis full-genome GeneChip array ATH1 (Affymetrix) for transgenic Arabidopsis roots overexpressing VND7. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNAs were isolated from roots of 5-day-old seedling of transgenic plants overexpressing YFP and VND7-YFP under control of Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Three independent biological replicates were performed for each sample."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Taku Demura","role":"submitter","email":"demura@riken.jp"}],"bibliography":[{"title":"VND-INTERACTING2, a NAC Domain Transcription Factor, Negatively Regulates Xylem Vessel Formation in Arabidopsis"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"StrainOrLine","value":["Col"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"STRAIN_OR_LINE","value":["Col"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":82844,"accession":"P-MTAB-2164"},{"id":82845,"accession":"P-MTAB-2165"},{"id":77,"accession":"P-AFFY-2"},{"id":163,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:MAS4:ExpressionCall"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":82846,"accession":"P-MTAB-13524"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
