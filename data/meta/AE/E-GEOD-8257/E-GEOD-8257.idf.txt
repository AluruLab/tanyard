Experiment Description	The goal of this experiment was to explore the extent of KIN10 (At3g01090) transcriptional regulation and identify its early target genes in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Results suggest that KIN10 targets a remarkably broad array of genes that orchestrate transcription networks, promote catabolism and autophagy, and suppress anabolism and ribosome biogenesis. The transient expression condition ruled out secondary or long-term effects of metabolism and growth, and circumvented experimental limitations caused by redundancy and embryonic lethality observed in mammals and plants. Experiment Overall Design: Analysis of the transcript changes induced by transient KIN10 (At3g01090) expression (6h) in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts using protoplasts similarly transfected with control plasmid DNA for comparison. To maximize the significance of the duplicated experimental data for defining differentially expressed genes, the biologically independent experiments were carefully performed by two individuals using different soil, plants, growth chambers, DNAs and microarray facilities for hybridization and scanning to cover potential technical and biological variations. For each pair (control & KIN10) of large-scale protoplast transfection experiments, about 3 million protoplasts were isolated from the fifth and sixth leaves of 36 randomly picked plants and pooled.   Experiment Overall Design: RNA samples isolated from control and KIN10-transfected protoplasts were subjected to quality controls, including RNA quality and quantity inspection by gel electrophoresis and staining as well as consistent gene expression changes by duplicated real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses of selected marker genes.

Protocol Description	Plants were grown in soil (Metro Mix-360) under 13h light (80-100 mmol/m2s) /11 h dark conditions at 23Â&deg;C and 65% relative humidity.	For protoplast isolation, leaves were harvested 2h after the onset of the light period. Protoplasts (about 3 million) were freshly isolated from the fifth and sixth leaves of 36 randomly picked plants and pooled for two large protoplast-transfection experiments (scaled up 50-fold) as described (Kovtun et al., 2000, PNAS 97, 2940; Hwang and Sheen, 2001, Nature 413, 383; Sheen, 2001, Plant Physiol. 127, 1466). Cells (1.5 x 10-6) were transfected with 1mg of control plasmid DNA and incubated in 10 ml mannitol buffer in a 150 x 15 mm Petri dish for 6h. Cells were kept at 23Â&deg;C under light (80 mmol/m2s) throughout the treatment period.	For protoplast isolation, leaves were harvested 2h after the onset of the light period.

Cells were kept at 23Â&deg;C under light (80 mmol/m2s) throughout the treatment period.	Total RNA was extracted using TrizolÂ® (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was further purified using a Qiagen RNEasy Mini Kit.	Eight micrograms of purified total RNA was labeled for hybridization using an ENZO BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (T7) following standard Affymetrix protocols (Affymetrix GeneChip Technical Analysis Manual)	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
