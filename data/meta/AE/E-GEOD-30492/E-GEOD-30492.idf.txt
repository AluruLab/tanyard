Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptomic characterization of a synergistic genetic interaction during carpel margin meristem development							
Experiment Description	We are interested in examining the transcriptional hierarchies that are required for proper formation and function of the carpel margin meristem in Arabidopsis thaliana. The carpel margin meristem (CMM) gives rise to the ovule primorida (which begin to form around flower stage 8).  We know that the loss of the seuss-3 (seu-3) and aintegumenta-1(ant-1) separately leads to a mild disruption of ovule formation, while the loss of both causes a complete loss of ovule formation. In this study we wanted to examine expression levels changed between each single mutant and the double mutant. We dissected out stage 8-10 carpel of each of the four genotypes (seu-3, ant-1, Col-0, seu-3 ant-1) pooling 15-25 carpels into one biological replicate. Then using 16 ATH1 arrays we hybridized, amplified and labeled cDNA to 16 arrays (4 replicates for each genotype). We then analyzed our data to reveal transcripts that went down in the double compared to either single mutant, and transcripts that went down more than additively in the double mutant compared to added level of the decrease of the single mutant levels. 16 arrays: 4 seuss-3, 4 aintegumenta-1, 4 Col-0, 4 seuss-3 aintegumenta-1.  Each biological replicate was a sample of 15-25 pooled stage 8-10 carpels manually dissected by hand.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Signal<br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	The hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99°C for 5 minutes, incubated at 45°C for 5 minutes and then injected into a GeneChip cartridge which was incubated at 45°C for at least 16 hours in a rotating oven at 60 rpm.  GeneChips were washed and stained using a Fluidics station 450 using protocol: EukGE-WS2v4_450. Samples processed by Expression Analysis (Durham, NC).	Plants were grown with long days (16 hrs) at 24 degrees C and randomized within the growth chamber.	The CHP files were generated in AGCC using the MAS 5.0 algorithm with a global scaling of 500. Samples were processed by Expression Analysis (Durham, NC).	Hardware: Affymetrix GC3000 scanner with 7G upgrade, Factory PMT settings. Software: AGCC version 3.1.1, CHP files were scaled using a target intensity of 500. Samples processed by Expression Analysis (Durham, NC).	All inforescence apices were collected from shoots that had produced between 10-20 mature (post anthesis) flowers below the inflorescenece apex.  Shoots younger or older than this were not used . Inforescence apices were collected and placed immediately in 100% ice-cold ethanol, then stored in ethanol at -20 degrees C until ready for dissection. Dissections of the inflorescence apices were completed within 6 days. Carpels/gynoecia from floral stages 8-10 were pooled with 15-25 gynoecia serving as one biological replicate.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit from Qiagen. Amplification, labeling, and fragmenting of the cDNA was carried out according to GeneChip 3' IVT Express Kit instructions from Affymetrix.	Amplification, labelling, and fragmenting of the cDNA was carried out according to GeneChip 3' IVT Express Kit instructions from Affymetrix.
