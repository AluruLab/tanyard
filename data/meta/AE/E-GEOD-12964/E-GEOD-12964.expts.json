This increased gene expressioin subsequently led to elevation of the biosynthetic flux in Arabidopsis roots. To determine the list of genes that are regulated by auxin-synthesizing brassinosteroids, we challenged Arabidopsis seedlings with either auxin only or auxin plus brassinosteroid biosynthetic inhibitor brassinazole.  Keywords: Hormone treatment Arabidopsis seedlings (Columbia ecotype) were grown for 10 d on 1× MS agar-solidified media under long-day conditions (16:8, white light and dark cycle). The seedlings were then transferred to 2 different liquid media containing either 10–7 M 2,4-D or 10–7 M 2,4-D plus 10–6 M brassinazole. After 8 h of treatment, the seedlings were blotted with paper towels to remove excess media and subject to total RNA isolation. Total RNAs isolated from each batch were prepared from 3 replicate seedlings using an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Germany)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Sunghwa Choe","role":"submitter","email":"shchoe@snu.ac.kr"},{"contact":"Sunghwa Choe","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21284753,"authors":"Chung Y, Maharjan PM, Lee O, Fujioka S, Jang S, Kim B, Takatsuto S, Tsujimoto M, Kim H, Cho S, Park T, Cho H, Hwang I, Choe S","title":"Auxin stimulates DWARF4 expression and brassinosteroid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["10 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["auxin","auxin and brassinazole"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1124977,"accession":"P-GSE12964-5"},{"id":1124978,"accession":"P-GSE12964-4"},{"id":1124979,"accession":"P-GSE12964-3"},{"id":1124980,"accession":"P-GSE12964-2"},{"id":1124975,"accession":"P-GSE12964-8"},{"id":1124974,"accession":"P-GSE12964-7"},{"id":1124976,"accession":"P-GSE12964-6"},{"id":1124973,"accession":"P-GSE12964-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
