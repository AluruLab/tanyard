Protocol Description	Plants exposed to 3 micromol m-2 s-1 UV-B (UV-B 313 tubes; Q-Panel, USA) for 4 hours	Plants were grown in compost for 3 weeks in 25 micromol m-2 s-1 continuous white light (warm white fluorescent tubes) at 21 oC	RNA was isolated from leaf tissue using the Purescript kit (Flowgen) according to the manufacturer instructions.	RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript II system (Invitrogen). The oligonucleotide used for priming was 5'-ggccagtgaattgtaatacgactcactatagggaggcgg-(t)24-3', as recommended by Affymetrix. dscDNA was in vitro transcribed to produce biotinylated cRNA using the Affymetrix GeneChip labelling kit.	Biotinylated cRNA was hybridised to Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChips using the standard Affymetrix procedure (45oC, 60 revs min-1, 16 hrs). Washing and staining were performed in a Fluidics Station 400 (Affymetrics) using Affymetrix protocol EukGE-WS2v4; the chips were stained with Streptavidin Phycoerythrin (SAPE) followed by biotinylated antibody followed by SAPE again.
