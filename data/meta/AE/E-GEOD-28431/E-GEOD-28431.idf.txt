Investigation Title	Skipsey: Fenclorim safening of Arabidopsis					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Skipsey: Fenclorim safening of Arabidopsis					
Experiment Description	Wild type Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 root cultures, were treated with fenclorim or 4-chloro-6-methyl-2-phenylpyrimidine dissolved in acetone to achieve a final concentration of 100uM. The final acetone concentration of 0.1% was replicated in control root cultures. Samples were taken at four and twenty-four hours post addition in biological triplicate. Root cultures were routinely maintained at 25C in the dark. 18 samples were used in this experiment
