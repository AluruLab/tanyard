Protocol Description	1. Prepare 0.5x MS media pH5.7 with 0.7% phytoagar<br><br>2. Sow approx. 300 sterile seeds on plate<br><br>3. Stratify for 4 days at 4oC<br><br>4. Place in a growth cabinet set at 21oC short days (8h light, 16 h dark)<br><br>5. Harvest plants after 10 days of growth<br><br><br>(Parameters: start time = 10, time unit = days, min temperature = 21, temperature unit = C, media = 0.5xMS)	1. Plant culture plates opened in a fume hood<br><br>2. Samples sprayed with either mock or DEX solutions:<br><br>   Mock=0.05% Silwet L77/0.1% Ethanol<br><br>   DEX =0.05% Silwet L77/0.1% Ethanol/10uM DEX<br><br>3. Allow plants to dry<br><br>4. Replace lid and return to growth chamber for 4h or 8h<br><br>	1. 300-600 mg Arabidopsis shoot tissue ground under liquid nitrogen     2. RNA extracted using QIAGEN - RNeasy Plant Mini Kit accoring to manufacturers instructions    3. RNA eluted in 50ul EB  (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = PCR)
