Protocol Type	specified_biomaterial_action	grow	pool	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	
Protocol Description	after 4 weeks rosette leaves were dissected from whole plants and immediately transferred to liquit N2 until sample collection was complete. Samples were stored at -80C until RNA extraction.	plants were grown on soil for 4 weeks at 23C, and 65% relative humidity. Light cycle was long day (LD): 16h light, 8h dark	Plant material from several individuals was pooled for each sample. All pooled individuals were grown at the same time, under same conditions. Extracts were prepared from these pools.	pdf of the protocol (Probe preparation Development) can be downloaded at http://www.weigelworld.org/resources/microarray/AtGenExpress/; also at TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org Protocol:501712557	pdf of the protocol (Probe preparation Development) can be downloaded at http://www.weigelworld.org/resources/microarray/AtGenExpress/; also at TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org Protocol:501712557	Title: Affymetrix EukGE-WS2v4_450 Hybridization.
