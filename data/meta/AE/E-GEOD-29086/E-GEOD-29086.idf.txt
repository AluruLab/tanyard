Investigation Title	Arabidopsis root Fe deficiency transcriptome							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Arabidopsis root Fe deficiency transcriptome							
Experiment Description	Fe deficiency stimulates a coordinated response involving reduction, transport and redistribution of Fe in the roots. The expression of genes regulated by Fe deficiency in the two contrasting Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes, Tsu-1 and Kas-1, shows that different ecotypes can respond in diverse ways, with different Fe regulated overrepresented categories. We use microarrays to analyze the Fe deficiency responses of contrasting Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes (Tsu-1 and Kas-1). Arabidopsis thaliana roots from the Kas-1 and Tsu-1 ecotypes were exposed to complete or -Fe nutrient solutions and collected after 24 and 48 h for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Experiments were done using three biological replicates.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = <br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Drosophila Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	Seeds were planted onto rockwool loosely packed into 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes with the bottoms removed. The tubes were floated in foam rafts in containers of nutrient solution. After 10 days, seedlings were transferred to holes in lids of containers contain nutrient solution with constant aeration for an additional 14 days before treatments.	The data was analyzed with GeneSpringX (Agilent) using the MAS5 algorithm	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.	Roots were collected after 24 or 48 h of exposure to complete (with 50 micromolar of Fe-EDDHA) or â€“Fe (without added Fe) solutions.	Quiagen RNeasy  extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
