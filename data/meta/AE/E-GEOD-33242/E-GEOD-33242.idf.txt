Comment[Submitted Name]	CHL1 functions as a nitrate sensor and also is one of major nitrate transporters responsible for nitrate responses and uptake.
Experiment Description	CHL1 functions as a nitrate sensor and also is one of major nitrate transporters responsible for nitrate responses and uptake. ANI is a protein phosphatase particiates in temporal nitrate response, its influence was analyzed in a global transcriptome study using Affymetrix ATH1 array. Two biological replicates of 10-day-old Arabidopsis root tissue from wild-type and ani1 plants were performed to explore differences in gene expression between the wild-type and ani1 mutants exposed to 200 Î¼M nitrate for 0h (T0), 0.5h (T0.5), or 16h (T16) using Affymetrix ATH1 microarray.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 500. ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity ABS_CALL =  DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on Affymetrix ATH1 Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	10-day-old plants were shifted to 60 mL of the same 12.5 mM (NH4)2 succinate medium in which the pH had been changed to 5.5 by addition of HCl. After overnight and additional 3 h refresh treatment, the plants were 1) collected the root sample (T0), or 2) shifted for 0.5 hour (T0.5), or 3) shifted for 16 hour to 60 mL of the same pH 5.5 growth medium, but with the 12.5 mM (NH4)2 succinate replaced by 200 uM KNO3, and the root sample was collected after 30 min or 16 hour induction.	Approximately 100 sterilized seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and ani1 plants (Columbia ecotype) were grown in different areas on the same mesh in a Magenta vessel (Sigma) in 60 mL of NO3--free liquid growth medium (10 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 pH 5.5, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM FeSO4-EDTA, 1 mM CaCl2, 50 uM H3BO3, 12 uM MnSO4x2O, 1 uM ZnCl2, 1 uM CuSO4xH2O, 0.2 uM Na2MoO4xH2O, 1 g/L MES, 0.5% sucrose) containing 12.5 mM (NH4)2 succinate as the sole nitrogen source, pH 6.5. For each biological replicate, 3 vessels ( ~ 300 seedlings / each replicate) of samples were pooled to use in a single independent experiment. Plants were grown under continuous illumination at 24-26C and rotated at 100 rpm.	Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technology, Grand Island, NY, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer standard instructions, followed by chloroform extraction and isopropanol / EtOH precipitation. The total RNA was further purified using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA)	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip scanner 3000.
