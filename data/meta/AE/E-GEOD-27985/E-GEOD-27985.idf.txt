Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis catalase 2 mutant in response to CO2 level and photoperiod											
Experiment Description	Growth daylength, ambient CO2 level, and intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) availability all impact plant function by modulating signalling pathways, but interactions between them remain unclear. Using a whole-genome transcriptomics approach, we exploited the conditional photorespiratory nature of the catalase-deficient cat2 mutant to identify gene expression patterns responding to these three factors. Arabidopsis Col-0 and cat2 grown for 5 weeks in high CO2 in short days (SD) were transferred to air in SD or long days (LD), and microarray analysis was performed. Of more than 500 genes differentially expressed in Col-0 between high CO2 and transfer to air in SD, the response of about one-third was attenuated by transfer to air in LD. H2O2-responsive genes in cat2 were highly dependent on daylength. The majority of H2O2-induced genes were more strongly up-regulated after transfer to air in SD than to LD, while a smaller number showed an opposing pattern. Responses of other H2O2-dependent genes indicate redox-modulation of the daylength control of fundamental cell processes. The overall analysis provides evidence that (1) CO2 level modulates stress-associated gene expression; (2) both CO2 and H2O2 interact with daylength and photoreceptor signalling pathways; and (3) cellular signalling pathways may be primed to respond to increased H2O2 in a daylength-determined manner. Two genotypes x five conditions experiment, including Arabidopsis Col0WT and cat2-1 plants grown in soil for 5 weeks in a 8h light/16h dark (short day) regime at high CO2 concentration (3000 ppm CO2) and subsequently transferred to air (400 ppm CO2) in a short day or long day (16h light/8h dark) regime for 2 and 4 days. Three biological replicates were used that consist each of a pool of two leaves from different plants. Each sample was hybridized to one GenechipÂ® Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array (Affymetrix).

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = log2 RMA normalized signal<br>ABS_CALL = the MAS 5.0 detection call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), marginal (M), or no call (NC)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 'detection p-value', p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Following fragmentation, 10 microg of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45 C and at 60 rounds/min. The GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400 and 450.	Plants were grown for five weeks in soil at high CO2 concentration (3000 ppm) in a short day regime (8h light/16h dark), 20 C/18 C, 65% relative humidity, 200 umol.m-2.s-1 irradiance at the leaf surface.	RMA-normalized expression values as obtained with the affy package of BioConductor. The reported values are on log2-scale.	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.	Transfer to air (400 ppm CO2) for 4 days in short day regime (8h light/16h dark)	Transfer to air (400 ppm CO2) for 2 days in long day regime (16h light/8h dark)	No transfer to air	Transfer to air (400 ppm CO2) for 2 days in short day regime (8h light/16h dark)	Transfer to air (400 ppm CO2) for 4 days in long day regime (16h light/8h dark)	RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and further purified using Qiagen RNeasy MiniElute Columns. Concentration and quality of the RNA was determined with a Nanodrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer and quality was examined using the RNA 6000 Nano Assay (Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer).	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 2 microg total RNA.
