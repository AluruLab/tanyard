Three independent biological replicates were performed with Col-0, wrky72-1 and wrky72-2 plants at 96 hpt with HpaNoco2 or mock treatment. Using a false discovery rate of less than 0.05 we identified for each of these three lines genes that showed significant transcriptional changes in response to HpaNoco2 compared to the mock-treated controls. Identification of downstream targets of WRKY72 in Arabidopsis by this microarray suggests that WRKY72 uses a unique signaling pathway that involves AP2\/ERF TFs independent of the ethylene signaling pathway. We intended to identify Arabidopsis genes that are regulated in WRKY72-dependent manner in response to Hyaloperonospora parasitica arabidopsis (Hpa) at 96 hpt. For this, we used Col-0 and two wrky72 mutant lines and compared the differentially expressed genes with the hypothesis ‘genes that are specifically regulated in Col-0 but not in wrky72 mutants are WRKY72-dependent genes’."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Thomas Eulgem","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Kishor Kumar Bhattarai","role":"submitter","email":"bkk33@cornell.edu"},{"contact":"Kishor K Bhattarai","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Isgouhi Kaloshian","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20409007,"authors":"Bhattarai KK, Atamian HS, Kaloshian I, Eulgem T","title":"WRKY72-type transcription factors contribute to basal immunity in tomato and Arabidopsis as well as gene-for-gene resistance mediated by the tomato R gene Mi-1.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["2 week"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["wild type","wrky72-1 mutant","wrky72-2 mutant"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["wild type","wrky72-1 mutant","wrky72-2 mutant"]},{"name":"infect","value":["Hyaloperonospora parasitica arabidopsis Noco2","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1125379,"accession":"P-GSE18329-1"},{"id":1125384,"accession":"P-GSE18329-2"},{"id":1125385,"accession":"P-GSE18329-3"},{"id":1125386,"accession":"P-GSE18329-4"},{"id":1125380,"accession":"P-GSE18329-8"},{"id":1125381,"accession":"P-GSE18329-7"},{"id":1125382,"accession":"P-GSE18329-6"},{"id":1125383,"accession":"P-GSE18329-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0}]}]}}
