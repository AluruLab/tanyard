Of over 24,000 genes probed, we identified 11,403 genes expressed in stigma tissue, 317 of these that are stigma specific (not expressed in control tissues). To appear in Sexual Plant Reproduction, Swanson, Clark, and Preuss, \"Expression Profiling of Arabidopsis Stigma Tissue Identifies Stigma-Specific Genes.\" Experiment Overall Design: Expression profiles of stigma, ovary and seedling tissues were studied and contrasted.
