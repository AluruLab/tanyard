Experiment Description	Microarray experiments were used to build a profile of candidate stigma genes that facilitate early pollination events.  Of over 24,000 genes probed, we identified 11,403 genes expressed in stigma tissue, 317 of these that are stigma specific (not expressed in control tissues). To appear in Sexual Plant Reproduction, Swanson, Clark, and Preuss, "Expression Profiling of Arabidopsis Stigma Tissue Identifies Stigma-Specific Genes." Experiment Overall Design: Expression profiles of stigma, ovary and seedling tissues were studied and contrasted. Four samples each of seedling and ovary were used; and three stigma samples.

Protocol Type	grow	grow	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation
Protocol Description	Ovary tissues were isolated from pistils after emasculating stage 8 buds (Bowman, 1994) of Landsberg erecta (Ler) flowers. After one day of growth, pistils were harvested. Stigma was seperated from ovaries using superfine tip scissors and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen until  RNA harvesting.	Seedling tissue was collected by growing Ler seedlings on Murashige and Skoog media plates for 10 days, and whole seedlings were harvested for RNA.	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol.
