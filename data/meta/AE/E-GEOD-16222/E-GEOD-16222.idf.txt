Experiment Description	Anoxia induces several heat shock proteins and a heat pre-treatment can acclimatize Arabidopsis seedlings to a subsequent anoxic treatment.  In this work we analyzed the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to anoxia, heat and a combined heat+anoxia stress. A significant overlapping between the anoxic and heat shock responses has been observed by whole-genome microarray analysis.  Experiment Overall Design: We treated Arabidopsis seedling, 4-days old, dark germinated with: Experiment Overall Design: -Control (23Â°C, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). Experiment Overall Design: -Heat-treated (38Â°C for 90 minutes, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). Experiment Overall Design: -Anoxia-treated (23Â°C,  under anoxia for 6h, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). Experiment Overall Design: -combined heat+Anoxia-treatment (23Â°C,  treated at 38Â°C for 90 min and thereafter under anoxia for 6h, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). Experiment Overall Design: Two biological replicates for each condition.

Protocol Description	Seeds were sterilized with diluted bleach (10-min incubation in 1.7% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed and washed seven times in sterile water) and incubated in 2.5 mL of liquid growing media (Murashige and Skoog half-strength solution in six-well plates) containing 30 mM sucrose. The plates were incubated in the dark at 4Â°C for two days (vernalization, to promote homogeneous germination) and then transferred to 23Â°C for four days in the dark before the treatments.

This sample represents the control.	Arabidopsis seedlings. Ecotype: Columbia 0; Age: 4 days; Germination: aerobic; Medium: Murashige-Skoog medium, half-strenght, sucrose 30 mM, 23Â°C, darkness; Treated at 38Â°c for 90 minutes and thereafter under anoxia for 6h at 23Â°C in the dark.  An enclosed anaerobic work station (Anaerobic System model 1025; Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH) was used to provide an oxygen-free environment for seedling incubation. This chamber uses palladium catalyst wafers and desiccant wafers to maintain strict anaerobiosis to less than 10 Âµg mLâ1 O2 (according to the manufacturerâs specifications). High-purity N2 was used to purge the chamber initially, and the working anaerobic gas mixture was N2:H2 with a ratio of 90:10.	Arabidopsis seedlings.

Total RNA was extracted from the seedling samples using the Ambion RNAqueous kit (Ambion). RNA quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. RNA was processed for use on Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip arrays.	Affymetrix standard labeling protocol	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description:
