In this work we analyzed the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to anoxia, heat and a combined heat+anoxia stress. A significant overlapping between the anoxic and heat shock responses has been observed by whole-genome microarray analysis.  Experiment Overall Design: We treated Arabidopsis seedling, 4-days old, dark germinated with: Experiment Overall Design: -Control (23°C, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). Experiment Overall Design: -Heat-treated (38°C for 90 minutes, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). Experiment Overall Design: -Anoxia-treated (23°C,  under anoxia for 6h, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose). Experiment Overall Design: -combined heat+Anoxia-treatment (23°C,  treated at 38°C for 90 min and thereafter under anoxia for 6h, dark, liquid Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30mM sucrose).
