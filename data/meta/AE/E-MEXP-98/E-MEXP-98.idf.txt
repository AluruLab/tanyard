Experiment Description	The aim of the expression profiling was to define and to apply criteria that allow discrimination between the effects of heat stress (HS) and HSF-dependent gene expression in Arabidopsis. Therefore we determined and analyzed the expression profiles of wild type (WT) and homozygous hsf1--/hsf3-- double knock out mutant plants (abbreviated hsf1/3). Hsf1/3 plants are deficient in HSF1 and HSF3 activity and unable to induce the fast transient expression of mRNAs of a number of HS genes tested (Lohmann et al., 2004).<br> The effects of HS on gene expression were analyzed after one hour heat treatment (37C) of leaf tissue.

Protocol Description	Plants were soilgrown in a dark/light cycle of 16/8h at 20C (60% humidity, 5000 lux light intensity)	Control Condition was administered by incubating leaves collected from 35 soil-grown plants for 1h at 22C in section incubation buffer (SIB: 1 mM potassium sulfate, pH 6.0 and 1 % sucrose) in a closed shaking water bath.	Heat shock was administered by incubating leaves collected from 35 soil-grown plants for 1h at 37C in section incubation buffer (SIB: 1 mM potassium sulfate, pH 6.0 and 1 % sucrose) in a closed shaking water bath. 	For RNA isolation the pooled leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissue was stored at -80C, and RNA was extracted with the Plant RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, GER), according to the manufacturer's instructions.	In vitro transcription by using double-stranded cDNA as a template in the presence of biotinylated UTP and CTP, using an ENZO BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, and ENZO Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	For comparison across multiple arrays, raw data was scaled by MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix) to the TGT-Value: 200. <br> Signal intensities for each probe were estimated from .cel files by the Robust Multichip Average expression summary (Irizarry et al., 2003) RMA.
