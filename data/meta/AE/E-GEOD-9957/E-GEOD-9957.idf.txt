Experiment Description	The rosettes from genotype Col-0, pmr5, pmr6 and pmr5 pmr6 double mutant were collected for RNA expression profiling when the plants were 3 weeks old. Experiment Overall Design: The rosettes were collected when the plants were 3 weeks old for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.
