Experiment Description	Background:  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic, widely-distributed, environmentally persistent, and carcinogenic byproducts of carbon-based fuel combustion. Previously, plant studies have shown that PAHs induce oxidative stress, reduce growth, and cause leaf deformation as well as tissue necrosis. To understand the transcriptional changes that occur during these processes, we performed microarray experiments on Arabidopsis thaliana L. under phenanthrene treatment, and compared the results to published Arabidopsis microarray data representing a variety of stress and hormone treatments. In addition, to probe hormonal aspects of PAH stress, we assayed transgenic ethylene-inducible reporter plants as well as ethylene pathway mutants under phenanthrene treatment.  Results:  Microarray results revealed numerous perturbations in signaling and metabolic pathways that regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and responses related to pathogen defense. A number of glutathione S-transferases that may tag xenobiotics for transport to the vacuole were upregulated. Comparative microarray analyses indicated that the phenanthrene response was closely related to other ROS conditions, including pathogen defense conditions. The ethylene-inducible transgenic reporters were activated by phenanthrene. Mutant experiments showed that PAH inhibits growth through an ethylene-independent pathway, as PAH-treated ethylene-insensitive etr1-4 mutants exhibited a greater growth reduction than WT. Further, phenanthrene-treated, constitutive ethylene signaling mutants had longer roots than the untreated control plants, indicating that the PAH inhibits parts of the ethylene signaling pathway.  Conclusions:  This study identified major physiological systems that participate in the PAH-induced stress response in Arabidopsis. At the transcriptional level, the results identify specific gene targets that will be valuable in finding lead compounds and engineering increased tolerance. Collectively, the results open a number of new avenues for researching and improving plant resilience and PAH phytoremediation. Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) plants were long-day grown with +/- 0.25 mM phenanthrene in sterile plates at 23C for 21d before harvest.  At least 20 plants were pooled prior to each mRNA extraction.

Protocol Description	Phenanthrene was thoroughly mixed into sterile media prior to pouring plates.	RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Molecular Research Center) per the manufacturer's instructions, DNAse treated (Invitrogen), and purified with RNeasy Mini Cleanup (Qiagen) per the manufacturers' instructions.	21d whole plants grown from sterilized seeds on 0.5MS + phytoagar, long-day light, 23C +/- 1C.	Labeling was performed with the Affymetrix Enzo kit per the manufacturer's instructions.	Chips were hybridized and processed on a Affymetrix Fluidics Station Model 450 per the manufacturer's instructions.	Hybridized chips were read on a model M10 scanner.	.CEL files were produced by the Affymetrix MAS, and normalization was performed in R/Bioconductor using the just.gcrma function with default parameters.		Values are unmodified outputs from Bioconductor/just.gcrma and represent the log2 transformation of the signal level.	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = GC-RMA log2 signal
