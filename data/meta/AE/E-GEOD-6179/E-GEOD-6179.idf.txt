Experiment Description	Arabidopsis genome sequencing has revealed the presence of at least three extensive gene families that may encode protein ligands. One of these, the SPH (S-protein homologue) family, was identified as a direct result of our studies on self-incompatibility in Papaver. The Arabidopsis SPH gene family consists of 81 members. We have initiated experimental work on a subset of these. RT-PCR studies indicate that many, if not all, SPH genes are expressed. Each SPH gene encodes an N-terminal signal peptide sequence and thus SPH proteins are likely to be secreted. Until recently none of the genes in this family had known function. However we have evidence that one member of the family, SPH1 is involved in leaf vascular development. In order to determine the function of SPH1, Arabidopsis plants were transformed with an SPH1 antisense construct. Analysis of the mutant phenotype shows that whilst plants appear as wt until principal growth stage 1.04, they subsequently show severe morphological defects. Plants are severely dwarfed with twisted rosette leaves at ~ 30% wt length and width as well as shortened inflorescence stem. Closer examination revealed aberrant leaf vasculature and severe reduction in expansion of parenchyma cells surrounding the primary leaf vein. We have conducted preliminary immunolocalisation studies with antibody raised to SPH1. These suggest that SPH1 protein is secreted by cells within the developing vasculature of the immature leaf (leaves<6mm in length). The data that we have so far obtained leads us to believe that SPH1 protein acts as a signalling molecule during early leaf development. As SPH1 is likely to be a signalling protein it is assumed that its interaction with a cognate receptor results in initiation of developmental processes within leaf tissue. The purpose of the experiment is to determine the network of genes within the normally developing rosette leaf whose expression is altered by SPH1. This will be accomplished by comparing transcriptional levels in rosette leaves of antisense-SPH1 plants with wt plants. We propose to make target RNA from rosette leaves taken from plants at principal stage 1.05 (immediately after initial appearance of developmental abnormality) and from plants at principal stage 1.14 (where gross changes are apparent). We propose to use replicate slides for each hybridisation, i.e. 2 hybridised to RNA from wt leaves at 1.05, 2 antisense at 1.05, 2 wt at 1.14 and 2 antisense at 1.14.

First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM Ã-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.   ; Protocol Type = labeling; Performers: John,Y,Okyere, Janet,,Higgins	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
