A stem-cell like precursor of stomata, a meristemoid. reiterates asymmetric divisions and renews itself before differentiating into guard cells. The transient and asynchronous nature of the meristemoid has made it difficult to study its molecular characteristics. Through combinatorial use of genetic resources that either arrest or constitutively drive stomatal cell-state progressions due to loss- or gain-of-function mutations in the key transcription factor genes, SPEECHLESS, MUTE, and SCRM, we obtained seedlings highly enriched in pavement cells, meristemoids, or stomata. Here we present transcriptome and genome-wide trends in gene regulation associated with each cell state and identify molecular signatures associated with meristemoids. 12 samples are included in this study. Three biological replicates of 5-dag seedlings of speechless, scrm-D and scrm-D;mute were compared wild type seedlings for changes in gene expression."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Keiko U Torii","role":"submitter","email":"ktorii@u.washington.edu"},{"contact":"Robin J Horst","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Kylee M Peterson","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Lynn J Pillitteri","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21963668,"authors":"Pillitteri LJ, Peterson KM, Horst RJ, Torii KU.","title":"Molecular profiling of stomatal meristemoids reveals new component of asymmetric cell division and commonalities among stem cell populations in Arabidopsis.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["5 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["scrm-D","scrm-D;mute","spch","wild type"]},{"category":"initial time point","value":["germination"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["scrm-D","scrm-D;mute","spch","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1127453,"accession":"P-GSE29814-8"},{"id":1127455,"accession":"P-GSE29814-5"},{"id":1127456,"accession":"P-GSE29814-4"},{"id":1127452,"accession":"P-GSE29814-7"},{"id":1127454,"accession":"P-GSE29814-6"},{"id":1127451,"accession":"P-GSE29814-1"},{"id":1127457,"accession":"P-GSE29814-2"},{"id":1127458,"accession":"P-GSE29814-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
