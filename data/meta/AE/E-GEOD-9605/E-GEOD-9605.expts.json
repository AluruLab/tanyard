In Arabidopsis, the homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) terminates meristem activity and promotes development of stamens and carpels. To understand the program of gene expression activated by AG, we followed genome-wide expression during early stamen and carpel development. Experiment Overall Design: Described in Gomez-Mena et al, 2005, Development 132: 429-438. Briefly, synchronous development of stamens and carpels was initiated by steroid treatment of plants homozygous for the ap1-1 and cal-1 mutations and expressing a fusion between AGAMOUS and the rat glucocorticoid receptor (35S:AGGR). RNA was extracted one, three and seven days after steroid treatment; two independent steroid-treated samples and two independent untreated controls were used for each time point."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Robert Sablowski","role":"submitter","email":"robert.sablowski@bbsrc.ac.uk"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":15634696,"authors":"Concepción Gómez-Mena, Stefan de Folter, Maria Manuela R Costa, Gerco C Angenent, Robert Sablowski","title":"Transcriptional program controlled by the floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS during early organogenesis.","doi":"10.1242\/dev.01600","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Genotype","value":["ap1-1 and cal-1, 35S:AGGR background"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["inflorescence tip"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND","value":["dexamethasone","ethanol only"]},{"name":"SAMPLING TIME POINT","value":["1 days","3 days","7 days"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":143,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4"},{"id":420659,"accession":"P-G9605-1"},{"id":420658,"accession":"P-G9605-3"},{"id":420661,"accession":"P-G9605-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":420660,"accession":"P-G9605-4"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
