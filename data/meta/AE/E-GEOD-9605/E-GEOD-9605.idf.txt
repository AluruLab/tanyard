Experiment Description	Floral organs, whose identity is determined by specific combinations of homeotic genes, originate  from a group of undifferentiated cells called the floral meristem. In Arabidopsis, the homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) terminates meristem activity and promotes development of stamens and carpels. To understand the program of gene expression activated by AG, we followed genome-wide expression during early stamen and carpel development. Experiment Overall Design: Described in Gomez-Mena et al, 2005, Development 132: 429-438. Briefly, synchronous development of stamens and carpels was initiated by steroid treatment of plants homozygous for the ap1-1 and cal-1 mutations and expressing a fusion between AGAMOUS and the rat glucocorticoid receptor (35S:AGGR). RNA was extracted one, three and seven days after steroid treatment; two independent steroid-treated samples and two independent untreated controls were used for each time point.

Protocol Description	Plants were grown on a mix of vermiculite:soil:sand at 18Â&deg;C with 16 hours light/8 hours dark cycles.	Dexamethasone (Sigma, stock solution 10 mM in ethanol) was used at a final concentration of 10 Î¼M in Silwet L-77 0.015%, applied directly on the inflorescence tips; for mock treatments, the solution contained the same amount of ethanol (0.1%) and Silwet L-77. After treatment, RNA was extracted from inflorescence apices and stored at -70 C until activation of AGGR was confirmed (2 weeks later).	Total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. For array hybridisation, the RNA was cleaned up with RNeasy columns (Qiagen) and precipitated to increase final concentration.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol.
