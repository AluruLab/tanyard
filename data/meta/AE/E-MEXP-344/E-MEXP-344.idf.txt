Experiment Description	5 to 7 days old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings of wildtype (Col-0) and the cytokinin deficient transgenic line 35S:CKX1 (Werner et al. Plant Cell 15, 2532) at growth stage 1.00 (Boyes scale) grown in liquid medium were induced witn 5 µM 6-Benzylaminopurine for different periods of time in order to find cytokinin-related changes in gene expression.

Protocol Description	Seedlings were treated for 2 hours with 1.13 mM KCl in liquid MS. The timing of the treatment was such that the plants were harvested between 6 and 8 hours after the onset of light. 	Seedlings were treated for 15 minutes with 5 µM 6-benzylaminopurine, 1.13 mM KCl in liquid MS. The timing of the treatment was such that the plants were harvested between 6 and 8 hours after the onset of light.	Seedlings were treated for 2 hours with 5 µM 6-Benzylaminopurine, 1.13 mM KCl in liquid MS. The timing of the treatment was such that the plants were harvested between 6 and 8 hours after the onset of light.	Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 wild type plants and transgenic homozygote 35S:CKX1 plants (Werner et al. Plant Cell 15, 2532) were used. The plants were grown in liquid MS in Petri dishes in a growth cabinet at 24 °C and light/dark periods of 16/8 hours to growth stage 1.00 (Boyes et al. Plant Cell 13, 1499).	Total RNA was extracted from seedlings with the TRIzol method. TRIzol reagent (38% phenol, 0.8 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.4 M ammonium thiocyanate, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH5, 5% glycerol), was made as described in the GIBCO TRIzol manual of Invitrogen (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). RNA was precipitated by the modified salt precipitation method for proteoglycan and polysaccharide contamination as described in the GIBCO troubleshooting guide. The total RNA was further purified using RNeasy mini columns including the on-column DNase digestion as described in appendix D (Qiagen RNeasy Mini Handbook, 3rd edition; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purified RNA was quantified by 260/280/230 nm UV light absorption with a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). An additional quality control was performed using non-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. 	cDNA was synthesized from 5 µg of purified total RNA with SuperScriptII (Invitrogen), and a mixture of RNase H, E. coli DNA polymerase I, and E. coli DNA ligase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification procedure (Qiagen). The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template in the Bioarray High Yield Transcript Labeling reaction (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY, USA) resulting in biotin-labeled cRNA. The labeled cRNA was purified using the RNeasy cleanup protocol (Qiagen) and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. 20 µg of biotin-labeled cRNA was fragmented for 35 min at 94 °C in fragmentation buffer (40 mM Tris-acetate, pH 8.1, 125 mM KOAc, and 30 mM MgOAc).
