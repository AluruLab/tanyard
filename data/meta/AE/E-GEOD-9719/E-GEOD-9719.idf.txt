Experiment Description	Gene expression analysis of 7d-old Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to short term (2 h) hypoxia, long term (9 h) hypoxia, and 1 h reoxygenation after long term (9 h) hypoxia to evaluate the regulation of gene expression at the level of translation. Experiment Overall Design: 30 samples, 5 conditions (2 hr hypoxia stress, 2hr non-stress, 9 hr hypoxia stress , 9 hr non-stress, 9 hr hypoxia with 1 hr recovery), 2 RNA pools (Total mRNA and polysomal mRNA), 3 replicates

Protocol Description	Seven-day old seedlings were subjected to short and long  hypoxia stress (HS) treatments (2h and 9h) or allowed to recover after 9h HS for 1h in air (re-oxygenation). Treatments started at the end of the light period and took place 6.5 uM m-1 s-1 light, i	Seeds from single copy transgene 35S:His6FLAG-RPL18B (Col-0) (Zanetti et al., 2005) were surface sterilized with 95 % (v/v) ethanol for 5 min, followed by 10 min submergence in bleach solution (20 % (v/v) bleach and 0.1 % (v/v) Tween-20), rinsed ad vernal	Whole seedlings were harvested into liquid nitrogen within < 3 min from release from treatment.  All mRNA extraction procedures were performed at 4 degreeC or on ice.
