Experiment Description	"Some soil bacteria promote plant growth, including Pseudomonas species. With this approach we detected significant changes in Arabidopsis genes related to primary metabolism that were induced by the bacteria. Pseudomonas G62 was applied to roots of 18 day-old Arabidopsis seedlings and the transcriptional profile of whole seedlings after 6 hours of treatment was analyzed."

Protocol Description	"Six hours before harvesting 18-day old seedlings, 500 Âµl of P. sp. G62 (OD 0.5 in 10 mM MgSO4), or MgSO4 only for controls was applied to the medium."	"One or two Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, from which the tip was cut off. The tubes contained sandy soil and were placed on peat substrate. Light conditions were 12 light/12 dark at 20Â°C and 18 Â°C, respectively."	Twenty-five seedlings were pooled for each of three  replicates per treatment. RNA was extracted from seedlings with RNeasy Mini Kit from Quiagen according to the manufacturerÂ´s protocol.	"cDNA synthesis and in vitro-transcription was done with AmbionÂ´s Message Amp II 96 Kit (Cat. No. 1819), starting with 1 Î¼g of total RNA"	"Hybridization solution was prepared according to AffymetrixÂ´ GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. The final concentration of cRNA was 60 ng/Î¼l. Hybridization was performed for 16-18 hours at 45Â°C and 60 rpm in a rotating hybridization oven (Hybridization Oven 640, Affymetrix)."	"Scanning was performed with the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix), which is controlled by AffymetrixÂ´ software GeneChip Operating System (GCOS) v1.4."	Data (.cel files) were quality-checked and normalized using robust multi array averaging (rma) with ROBIN software (Lohse et al. 2010) and analyzed with MapMan software (Usadel et al. 2005).
