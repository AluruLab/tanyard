For the purposes of this study we captured 6 compartments: embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat and seed coat, as well sets of serial sections encompassing the entire heart stage seed. Experiment Overall Design: Heart stage seed compartments were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 16 samples (embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, seed coat and whole seeds, 2 biological replicates each; chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat, 3 biological replicates each)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Ryan Christopher Kirkbride","role":"submitter","email":"rkirkbride@ucdavis.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20385809,"authors":"Le BH, Cheng C, Bui AQ, Wagmaister JA, Henry KF, Pelletier J, Kwong L, Belmonte M, Kirkbride R, Horvath S, Drews GN, Fischer RL, Okamuro JK, Harada JJ, Goldberg RB.","title":"Global analysis of gene activity during Arabidopsis seed development and identification of seed-specific transcription factors.","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1003530107","status":"published"},{"accession":20702726,"authors":"Zuber H, Davidian JC, Aubert G, Aim√© D, Belghazi M, Lugan R, Heintz D, Wirtz M, Hell R, Thompson R, Gallardo K.","title":"The seed composition of Arabidopsis mutants for the group 3 sulfate transporters indicates a role in sulfate translocation within developing seeds.","doi":"10.1104\/pp.110.162123","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["heart stage"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Ws-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["chalazal endosperm","chalazal seed coat","embryo proper","micropylar endosperm","peripheral endosperm","seed","seed coat"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"ORGANISM PART","value":["chalazal endosperm","chalazal seed coat","embryo proper","micropylar endosperm","peripheral endosperm","seed","seed coat"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":16,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":449848,"accession":"P-G15160-1"},{"id":449846,"accession":"P-G15160-2"},{"id":449847,"accession":"P-G15160-3"},{"id":449845,"accession":"P-G15160-4"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
