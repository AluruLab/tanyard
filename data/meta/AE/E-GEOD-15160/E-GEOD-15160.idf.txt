Experiment Description	We collected heart stage seed compartments from 7 micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments from seeds containing heart stage embryos. For the purposes of this study we captured 6 compartments: embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat and seed coat, as well sets of serial sections encompassing the entire heart stage seed. Experiment Overall Design: Heart stage seed compartments were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 16 samples (embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, seed coat and whole seeds, 2 biological replicates each; chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat, 3 biological replicates each).

Protocol Description	Siliques between 1.2 and 1.5 cm long containing heart stage seeds were collected from 38-46 day old plants. Siliques were sub-divided and fixed in 3:1 (v/v) ethanol to acetic acid and embedded in paraffin. Microdissection of compartments was carried out on sections using a Leica LMD6000 system.	Plants were grown in a Conviron chamber under continuous light with fluorescent lamps at 20Â°C and 50% - 70% relative humidity.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNaqueous Micro-Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) using a modified protocol incorporating an on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen RNase-Free DNase Set) during column washes.	5 to 6 ng of total RNA was amplified using the WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA). cDNAs were fragmented and labeled with NuGEN FL-Ovationâ¢ cDNA Biotin Module V2.
