Experiment Description	In order to protect themselves from pathogens, plants activate a battery of defense pathways, many of which involve changes in gene expression.  We are interested in identifying plant genes that are differentially expressed in response to pathogen exposure, with the ultimate goal of studying the roles of these genes in plant defense. Experiment Overall Design: Whole plants are grown in soil, and individual leaves from 3-4 week old plants are injected with a bacterial suspension, or a mock (5mM MgSO4) control. Approximately five leaves are harvested 24 hours after inoculation and used for RNA preparation, labeling and Affymetrix hybridization.

Protocol Description	Plants were grown in pots with BM-2 soil (Berger Peat Moss Ltd, Quebec, Canada) at a density of 9 plants per pot and kept at 22 degrees Celsius and 75% humidity with a 12 hour day length.	Individual leaves were injected in the morning using a needle-less syringe with 10E5 cfu cm-2 PsmES4326 (suspended in 5mM MgSO4) and harvested 24 hours later.	Individual leaves were injected in the morning using a needle-less syringe with 5mM MgSO4 and harvested 24 hours later.
