We are interested in identifying plant genes that are differentially expressed in response to pathogen exposure, with the ultimate goal of studying the roles of these genes in plant defense. Experiment Overall Design: Whole plants are grown in soil, and individual leaves from 3-4 week old plants are injected with a bacterial suspension, or a mock (5mM MgSO4) control. Approximately five leaves are harvested 24 hours after inoculation and used for RNA preparation, labeling and Affymetrix hybridization."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Raka Mustaphi Mitra","role":"submitter","email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":17181774,"authors":"Masanao Sato, Raka M Mitra, John Coller, Dong Wang, Natalie W Spivey, Julia Dewdney, Carine Denoux, Jane Glazebrook, Fumiaki Katagiri","title":"A high-performance, small-scale microarray for expression profiling of many samples in Arabidopsis-pathogen studies.","issue":3,"pages":"565-77","publication":"Plant J","volume":49,"year":2007}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":2,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":59356,"accession":"P-G4429-5"},{"id":59355,"accession":"P-G4429-3"},{"id":59358,"accession":"P-G4429-4"},{"id":59357,"accession":"P-G4429-1"},{"id":59359,"accession":"P-G4429-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":2,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":2,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
