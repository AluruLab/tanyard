Experiment Description	Oomycetes from the genus Phytophthora are fungus-like plant pathogens that are devastating for agriculture and natural ecosystems. Due to particular physiological characteristics, no treatments against diseases caused by oomycetes are presently available. To develop such treatments, it appears essential to dissect the molecular mechanisms that determine the interaction between Phytophthora species and host plants. The present project is focused on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the compatible plant-oomycete interaction and plant disease. The laboratory developed a novel interaction system involving the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Phytophthora parasitica, a soil-borne pathogen infecting a wide host range, thus representing the majority of Phytophthora species. A characteristic feature of the compatible Arabidopsis/P. parasitica interaction is an extended biotrophic phase, before infection becomes necrotrophic. Because the initial biotrophic phase is extremely short on natural (e.g. solanaceous) hosts, the Arabidopsis system provides the opportunity to analyze, for both interaction partners, the molecular events that determine the initiation of infection and the switch to necrotrophy. The present project aims at analyzing the compatible interaction between A. thaliana roots and P. parasitica. The Affymetrix A. thaliana full genome chip will be used to characterize modulations of the transcriptome occurring over a period of 24h from the onset of plant root infection to the beginning of necrotrophy. Parallel to this study, a custom-designed P. parasitica biochip will enable analyzing of P. parasitica gene expression during the same stages. 10 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	Seeds were grown on 1x Murashige and Skoog agar medium (MS; 4.4 gL-1, Sigma Chemical Compagny, MO, USA) supplemented with 10 gL-1 saccharose (Prolabo) and 20 gL-1 agar (difco Agar, Dedon, Dickinson and compagnie, MD, USA). 15-day-old plants were transferred to new square Petri dishes containing a strip of 1 x MS agar Medium and underneath 10 ml of 0.1 x MS medium. Plants were grown under 8h photoperiod at 25C for 1 month.	A. thaliana roots were inoculated with Phytophthora parasitica 310 strain (10^6 zoospores per Petri dish).	Mock-inoculated roots.	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	Labelled using protocol described in manual "Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual", One-Cycle target labelling	Biotin Labelled cRNA using "Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit", according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0-calculated signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call
