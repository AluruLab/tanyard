Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcription profiling  to investigate the photoperiodic control of starch mobilisation in Arabidopsis thaliana
Experiment Description	In order to identify genes specifically involved in the photoperiodic control of the mobilisation programme for starch reserve in Arabidopsis thaliana transcription profiling was performed on the following genotypes Columbia wild type (Col-0), CO overexpressor (35S::CO), CO muntant (co-10), GBSSI mutant (gbs-1), aps1 mutant (aps1) and Columbia with sucrose. The different Arabidopsis thaliana genotype seedlings were cultivated in long day conditions (16 h day/ 8 h dark) at 22 C in controlled environment cabinets for two weeks. Samples were collected at ZT 4, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed.

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana wild type ecotype (Col-0) and genotypes 35S::CO, co-10, aps1 y gbs-1 seedlings were cultivated in agar plates in long day conditions (16 h day/ 8 h dark) at 22 C in controlled environment cabinets for two weeks. Samples were collected at ZT 4 and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed.	Three independent sets of seedling plates (fully expanded cotyledons) of each line were sampled for RNA extraction, following the Trizol method (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). The total RNA extracted from each sample was further purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the kit manual.	pdf of the protocol can be downloaded at TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org Protocol:501712557	The cDNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix expression array ATH1-121501 as described by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, http://www.affymetrix.com)		Microarray data was processed from CEL files with FIESTA@BioinfoGP, an interactive server for analyzing DNA microarray experiments with replicates (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/FIESTA) and using the R package Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/) for quality control, background correction, normalization and calculation of the expression levels. Three different biological replicates were used for each genotype.
