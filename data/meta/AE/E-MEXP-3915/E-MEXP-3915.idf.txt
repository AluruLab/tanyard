Protocol Name	P-MTAB-33000	P-MTAB-33001	P-MTAB-33002	P-MTAB-33003
Protocol Description	The normalized data was obtained by using RMA. All chips were normalized together using robust multichip average.  Median polish was used for the probe level summary.	Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type Col-0 and T-DNA insert lines were grown in growth chambers at 22 oC under long day condition (16 hrs light). Stems of 35 days old plants were used for all experiments. (Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)	Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit according to the kit protocol. (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Chips are loaded onto the machine and scanned as manufacturer's recommendations.(Parameters: Scanning hardware = GeneChip Scanner 3000 [Affymetrix], Scanning software = MAS/GCOS/GREX [Affymetrix])
Protocol Type	normalization data transformation protocol	growth protocol	nucleic acid extraction protocol	array scanning protocol
