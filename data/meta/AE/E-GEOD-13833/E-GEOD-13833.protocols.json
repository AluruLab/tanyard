Aerial tissues of 2 week old soil grown Arabidopsis seedlings were sprayed with 100uM 3,5-Dichloroanthranilic acid (DCA), or 100uM 2,6-Dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA) or mock solution and harvested 48h or 6 days after the treatment. Final DMSO concentrations never exceeded 0.002%.  Mock treatments were application of 0.002% DMSO in water.
