Experiment Description	Total RNA was extracted from arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia) seeds 10 days after pollination from 2 sets of 3 biological replicates of wild-type and mutant plants. Mutant plants were AMP1-1 mutants carrying a stop codon in the middle of the gene resulting in truncated protein.

Protocol Description	10DAP developing seed	Raw CEL files were imported in R using the affy Bioconductor package. Data was background subtracted and normalised using the RMA algorithm. Data was transformed to log base 2.
