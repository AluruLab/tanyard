Protocol Type	grow	pool	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	
Protocol Description	Plants were grown on soil for 4 days under continuous light  at 23Â°C and  65% relative humidity. Most replicates were grown at the same time, exceptions to this are indicated by the 'replicate timepoint' parameter.	above soil plant material of 15 seedlings was pooled per replicate	pdf of the protocol (Probe preparation Development) can be downloaded at http://www.weigelworld.org/resources/microarray/AtGenExpress/; also at TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org Protocol:501712557	pdf of the protocol (Probe preparation Development) can be downloaded at http://www.weigelworld.org/resources/microarray/AtGenExpress/; also at TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org Protocol:501712557	Title: Affymetrix EukGE-WS2v4_450 Hybridization.
