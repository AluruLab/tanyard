Investigation Title	Expression profiling of dexamethasone inducible expression of YFP-CPR5-C in Arabidopsis						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression profiling of dexamethasone inducible expression of YFP-CPR5-C in Arabidopsis
Experiment Description	Identification of early transcriptional responses to CPR5 function loss in Arabidopsis Expression of CPR5 C terminal half efficiently interferes with native CPR5 protein function and causes a dominant negative effect. Four-week-old leaves of Col-0 WT and transgenic Dex:YFP-CPR5-C plant were sprayed with water or 50 uM dexamethasone to induce expression of CPR5-C. Samples were collected at 24 hours after treatment. Three biological replicates were performed per genotype per treatment.

Protocol Name	P-GSE72743-1	P-GSE72743-5	P-GSE72743-6	P-GSE72743-2	P-GSE72743-3	P-GSE72743-4	P-GSE72743-7
Protocol Description	The data were normalized with RMA algorithm using Gene-Spring GX default analysis settings ID_REF =  VALUE = Normalized RMA signal value	RNA probes were labelled using MessageAmp Premier RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion)	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of aRNA were hybridized on Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip (Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A) for 16 hours at 45C with rotation at 60rpm.	Mature leaves were sprayed with water or 50 uM dexamethasone	Arabidopsis plants were grown on soil (Metro Mix 360) at 22ËC under a 12/12 hr light/dark cycle for 4 weeks	The RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Ambion)	Immediately following hybridization, the hybridized probe arrays undergo an automated washing and staining protocol on the GeneChipÂ® FS450 fluidic station and are then scanned on the GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G Plus where patterns of hybridization are detected.
