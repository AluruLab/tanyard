Comment[Submitted Name]	Inducible overexpression analysis of KUODA1 in Arabidopsis seedlings
Experiment Description	To identify potenital target genes of the transcription factor KUODA1 (AT5G47390), we performed expression profiling using an estradiol inducible overexpression system. Estradiol-treatment allows for the nuclear translocation of the constitutively expressed chimeric transcription factor XVE and subsequent expression of KUA1 from the LexA promoter. Stable trangenic T3 seedlings were grown for 14 days and either treated with 15 ÂµM estradiol or ethanol (mock) for 4 hours. Two mock and two  estradiol treated samples were used for RNA isolation and hybridization.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis ID_REF =  VALUE = Signal ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M) DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 ug total RNA	Hybridizations against Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array (GeneChip System®, Affymetrix) chips were performed at 45 °C for 16 h, in the Affymetrix GeneChip Workstation (hybridization oven 640, Fluidics Station 450), using 10 µg of Biotin-labeled aRNA, according to the manufacturer's protocol.	14-day-old seedlings were transferred to liquid MS medium and subsequently estradiol disolved in ethanol (treatment) or ethanol alone (mock) was added to each well. After 4 hours seedlings were collected and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage.	T3 seeds were stratified on plate for 72 h in the dark at 4°C and then transferred to 22°C with a 16-h light (100 Î¼E mâˆ’2 sâˆ’1)/8-h dark period.	Total RNA was extracted with the Plant RNAeasy kit (Qiagen)	GeneChips were scanned by use of the Affymetrix GeneChip Workstation Scanner 3000.
