Comment[Submitted Name]	Targets of ALTERED PHLOEM DEVELOPMENT (APL)						
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis phloem from Altered Phloem Development (APL) mutants and wild type controls						
Experiment Description	We profiled transcripts from sorted phloem cells of wild-type and apl mutants to identify the genes regulated by APL in phloem. We profiled transcripts from sorted phloem cells of wild-type and apl mutants to identify the genes regulated by APL in phloem. Three biological replicates for control WT and apl mutants were used in thes study. Root tissue was protoplasted and sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Total RNA was extracted from GFP+ protoplasts.
