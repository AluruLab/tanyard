Experiment Description	Null mutations in the SAL1 protein, a bi-functional protein with inositol polyphosphate-1-phosphotase activity and nucleosidase activity, result in mutants with altered leaf morphology, delayed growth and tolerance to drought stress. This experiment examines the gene expression of two SAL1 mutants, alx8 in the Col-0 background and fry1-1 in the C24 background, under normal growth conditions. In brief, RNA was extracted from the leaves of three plants of each mutant and their respective ecotypes two hours after lights on. Plants were grown under normal conditions for 5 weeks before harvesting. Each array represent a single biological replicate.

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis was grown on metro mix soil (35 % Canadian Peat Moss, 19 % Perlite 500, 40 % vermiculite, 1.5 g l-1 lime), vernalised for 72 to 96 h and fertilized with 0.5X Hoaglandâs once a fortnight (Hoaglands and Arnon, 1950). Normal growth conditions were a light (150 &#956;mol photons m&#8722;2 sec&#8722;1)/dark cycle of 12/12 h at 21 + 2 Â°C and 55 % relative humidity.	Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Protocol (QIAGEN) including an on-column DNase treatment using the RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. The quality of the RNA was verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer and spectrophotometric analysis to determine concentration and the A260 to A280 and A260 to A230 ratios.	Preparation of labeled cRNA from 5 ug of total RNA was carried out almost exactly as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual using the Affymetrix One-Cycle Target Labeling kit and Control Reagents and for each sample, 20ug of cRNA was fragmented, labeled and used for hybridisation. 	Target hybridisation was carried out exactly as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, using the Affymetrix Eukaryotic Hybridisation kit and Hybridisation Control Kit and an Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640. After overnight hybridisation, arrays were washed and stained using the Affymetrix Wash and Stain kit and an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 (EukGE-WS2v5_450) as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. 	Scanning was performed with a Affymetrix 7G scanner according to the manufacturers instructions.	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description:
