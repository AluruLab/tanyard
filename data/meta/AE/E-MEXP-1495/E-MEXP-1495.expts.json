This experiment examines the gene expression of two SAL1 mutants, alx8 in the Col-0 background and fry1-1 in the C24 background, under normal growth conditions. In brief, RNA was extracted from the leaves of three plants of each mutant and their respective ecotypes two hours after lights on. Plants were grown under normal conditions for 5 weeks before harvesting. Each array represent a single biological replicate."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Pip B Wilson","role":"submitter","email":"pip.wilson@anu.edu.au"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19170934,"authors":"Wilson PB, Estavillo GM, Field KJ, Pornsiriwong W, Carroll AJ, Howell KA, Woo NS, Lake JA, Smith SM, Harvey Millar A, von Caemmerer S, Pogson BJ","title":"The nucleotidase\/phosphatase SAL1 is a negative regulator of drought tolerance in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-313X.2008.03780.x"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["5 week"]},{"category":"genetic modification","value":["induced mutation"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["alx8","fry1-1","wild_type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf"]},{"category":"provider","value":["ABRC","Pogson Lab, ANU, Australia"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"ecotype","value":["C24","Columbia-0"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["alx8","fry1-1","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1165580,"accession":"P-MEXP-139224"},{"id":1165579,"accession":"P-MEXP-139226"},{"id":1165576,"accession":"P-MEXP-142187"},{"id":1165578,"accession":"P-MEXP-142188"},{"id":1165577,"accession":"P-MEXP-142189"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
