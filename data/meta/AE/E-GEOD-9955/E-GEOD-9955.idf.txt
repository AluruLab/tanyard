Experiment Description	"The 4 weeks old plant of genotype Col-0, mil4, sid2 and mil4 sid2 double mutants were sprayed with BTH. The rosette tissue were collected for RNA expression profiling. Experiment Overall Design: The rosettes were collected when the plants were 4 weeks old for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays."
