Protocol Description	The CEL files produced by GCOS 1.3 were analyzed using GCRMA package (ver.2.0.0) on the statistical software R. ID_REF =  VALUE = Log2 transformed GC-RMA signal.	The CEL files produced by GCOS 1.3 were analyzed using GCRMA package on the statistical software R. ID_REF =  VALUE = Log2 transformed GC-RMA signal.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared from 2ug of total RNA using One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix) according to manufacturers protocol.	20 ug of labeled and fragmented cRNA was hybridized to GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array using GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix). Wash and stain was performed by GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix). All operations were performed with Hybridization, Stain and Wash Kit (Affymetrix) according to manufacturer's protocol (hws_kit_manual).	Developing seeds dissected from sliequs.	16h light/8h dark, 22°C	The total RNA was extracted using Concert Plant RNA Reagent (Invitrogen) and was followed by purification using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).	GeneChips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix) controled by GCOS 1.4 (Affymetrix).	GeneChips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix) controled by GCOS 1.3 (Affymetrix).
