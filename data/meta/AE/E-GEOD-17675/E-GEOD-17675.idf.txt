Experiment Description	Arabidopsis ppi2 plants have a T-DNA insertion in atToc159 and thus display a severe defect in protein import into chloroplasts. These mutants have an albino phenotype and also are seedling lethal. We used microarrays to detail the induced genes in ppi2 plants compard to wild type plants. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis plants, wild-type and ppi2 plants, were grown for 10 or 20 days, respectively, and total RNA was used for analysis.

Protocol Description	No special treatment was given.	plants were grown on MSagar plates for xx days with 16h/8h light/dark cycle at 70% relative humidity at 20C in a growth chamber.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 3 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual Rev. 3, 2005, Affymetrix).	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The normalized data were log-transformed with base 2. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100.
