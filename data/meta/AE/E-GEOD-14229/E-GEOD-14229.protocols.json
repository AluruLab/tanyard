Briefly, the first cycle of cDNA synthesis was carried out using an oligo (dT) primer fused to a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and was followed by the first cycle of in vitro transcription using  T7 RNA polymerase to generate cRNA. The cRNA was used as a template for the second cycle of cDNA synthesis followed by the second cycle of in vitro transcription, to generate the biotin-labeled antisense cRNA.","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1125081,"accession":"P-G14229-3","name":null,"text":"The seeds were dissected out from siliques in RNAlater solution (Ambion) and total RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN).
