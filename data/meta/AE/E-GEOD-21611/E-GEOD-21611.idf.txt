Investigation Title	Oscillating gene expression determines competence for periodic branching in the Arabidopsis root					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Oscillating gene expression determines competence for periodic branching in the Arabidopsis root					
Experiment Description	The Oscillation Zone (OZ) of unsynchronized roots was dissected and divided into an upper (OZ2) and lower (OZ1) half . Samples were ordered according to DR5:GUS expression as analyzed by real time PCR to find periodic expression patterns Seedlings were grown for 5 days. 39 individual roots were dissected for RNA extraction. These microarray samples profile a specific region of the root tip designated as the Oscillation zone. Arrangement of the samples in the following order: OZ1-1, OZ1-4, OZ1-23, OZ1-14, OZ1-17, OZ1-2, OZ1-6, OZ1-13, OZ1-15, OZ1-16, OZ1-10, OZ1-32, OZ1-3, OZ1-31, OZ1-22, OZ1-35, OZ1-19, OZ1-9, OZ1-33, OZ1-20, OZ2-4, OZ2-23, OZ2-14, OZ2-6, OZ2-13, OZ2-15, OZ2-10, OZ2-32, OZ2-22, OZ2-35, OZ2-19, OZ2-9, OZ2-20, OZ2-36, OZ2-39, OZ2-21, OZ2-40, OZ2-38, OZ2-1, was used to identify periodic expression patterns.
