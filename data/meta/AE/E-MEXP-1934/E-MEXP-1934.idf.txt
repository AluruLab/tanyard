Experiment Description	Arabidopsis plants were treated either with mock or MSB (0.2 mM of Menadione sodium bisulphite). <br>Tissue was sampled after 3, 6 and 24 hours.						
Protocol Name	P-MTAB-2470	P-MTAB-2471	P-MTAB-2469	P-AFFY-2	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown	P-AFFY-6	P-MTAB-2525
Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	grow	specified_biomaterial_action	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation
Protocol Description	Total RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's recommendation. Following extraction, an additional step of column purification with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was added to ensure the purity of the RNA.  <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Plants of Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Col-0.<br><br>Seeds were sowed in soil and kept at 4 C for 2 days (stratification).<br><br>After stratification, the pots are transferred to growth conditions, in a walk-in chamber.<br><br>The conditions of grow are:<br><br>Light from 10 am to 6 pm, at 21 C<br><br>Dark from 6 pm to 10 am, at 19 C.<br><br>No humidity control.<br><br><br><br><br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)	Plants of Arabidopsis growing in short day were treated at day 17th of growth. The treatment was applied with a conventional sprayer. For mock treatments, only distilled water was used. For MSB, 0.2 mM of Menadione sodium bisulphite (SIGMA M5750) was used. The treatments were done approximately 30 minutes after the start of the artificial day.	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	The normalization was done with the package "affy" of "R". The function used was "rma(Data)".
