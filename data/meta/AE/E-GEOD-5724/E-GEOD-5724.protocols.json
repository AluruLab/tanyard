The GF\/A paper was left in direct contact with the zone of elongation on 3 lateral roots per plant for 48 hours. Sections of root containing syncytia have been excised from the thin and transparent roots of Arabidopsis and collected into RNAlater solution (Ambion) at 21 days post infection (Growth Stage 6.1). The female nematode has been removed.","type":"specified_biomaterial_action","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null}]}}
