Experiment Description	The effect of ahg1 and ahg3 on the gene expression profiles is similar but some genes are differentially affected. Experiment Overall Design: To investigate the effect of ahg1 and ahg3 mutations, the genome wide gene expression profiles of germinating seedlings were examined. These mutations occurred in close but distinct PP2C genes. Stratified seeds were transferred to plates containing 0.5 uM ABA and allowed germinate at 23 Â°C under 16hr light 8hr dark conditions. After two days samples were collected for RNA extraction.

Protocol Description	After stratification at 4Â&deg;C for 4 days, seeds were allowed to germinate on the MS-2% sucrose plate for two days	After stratification at 4Â&deg;C for 4 days, seeds were allowed to germinate on the MS-2% sucrose plate containing 0.5 uM ABA for two days	The plates were kept in a growth chamber with a conditions; 23Â&deg;C, 16 hr light and 8 hr dark cycles	Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using a RNease MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen).	First-strand of cDNA was synthesized using 16 Â&#956;g of total RNA and SuperScript Double-stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The labeled cRNA was synthesized using BioArray RNA Transcripts Labeling Kit (T7) (ENZO Life Sciences inc.). After labeling, the cRNA was digested partially by incubating in 40 mM Tris-acetate, pH8.0, 100 mM KOAc, 30 mM MgOAc, at 94Â&deg;C for 35 min. Then 30 Â&#956;g cRNA was used for microarrary hybridization.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description:
