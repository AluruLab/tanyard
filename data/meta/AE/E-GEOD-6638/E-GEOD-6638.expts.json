Experiment Overall Design: To investigate the effect of ahg1 and ahg3 mutations, the genome wide gene expression profiles of germinating seedlings were examined. These mutations occurred in close but distinct PP2C genes. Stratified seeds were transferred to plates containing 0.5 uM ABA and allowed germinate at 23 Â°C under 16hr light 8hr dark conditions. After two days samples were collected for RNA extraction."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Takashi Hirayama","role":"submitter","email":"hirayama@gsc.riken.jp"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":17461784,"authors":"Noriyuki Nishimura, Tomo Yoshida, Nobutaka Kitahata, Tadao Asami, Kazuo Shinozaki, Takashi Hirayama","title":"ABA-Hypersensitive Germination1 encodes a protein phosphatase 2C, an essential component of abscisic acid signaling in Arabidopsis seed.","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-313X.2007.03107.x","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["germinating seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["ahg1-1","ahg3-1","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND","value":["ABA","none"]},{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["ahg1-1","ahg3-1","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":8,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":424816,"accession":"P-G6638-1"},{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":424819,"accession":"P-G6638-2"},{"id":424817,"accession":"P-G6638-3"},{"id":424820,"accession":"P-G6638-4"},{"id":424818,"accession":"P-G6638-5"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
