Comment[Submitted Name]	Identification of heat stress-targets of translational control by large scale analysis of Arabidopsis trancriptome and translatome.
Experiment Description	Heat stress is one of the most prominent and deleterious environmental threads affecting plant growth and development. Upon high temperatures, plants launch specialized gene expression programs that promote stress protection and survival. These programs involve global and specific changes at the transcriptional and translational levels. However the coordination of these processes and their specific role in the establishment of the heat stress response is not fully elucidated. In this report, we have carried out a genome-wide analysis to simultaneously monitor the individual changes in the transcriptional and translational mRNA levels of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings after the exposure to a heat shock stress. Our results demonstrated that, superimposed to transcription, translation exerts a wide but dual regulation of gene expression. For the majority of mRNAs, translation is severely repressed, causing a decreased of 50% of the association of the bulk of mRNAs to polysomes. However, some relevant mRNAs involved in different aspects of homeostasis maintenance follow a differential pattern of translation. Analysis of the sequence of the differentially translated mRNAs unravels that some features, like the 5¬¥UTR G+C content and the cDNA length, may take part in the discrimination mechanisms for mRNA polysome loading.  Among the differential translated genes stand out master regulators of the stress response, highlighting the main role of translation in the early establishment of physiological response of plants to elevated temperatures. In total 8 ATH1 Affymetrix GeneChips were hybridized with all combinations of two factors: total mRNA/polysome-bound-RNA; 22¬∫C/38¬∫C. Two biological replicates per sample type were performed.

Protocol Description	GeneChip intensities were background-corrected, normalized and sumarized by RMA method, using the ‚ÄúAffy‚Äù package from Bioconductor. To quantify the amount of individual mRNAs in the polysomal samples, the RMA data values of POLY-38 samples were further adjusted based on the heavy polysome content (HPC), as previously described. Briefly, the normalization factor was generated from the quantitative measurement of the relative heavy polysome content (HPC38¬∫C/HPC22¬∫C) in each biological experiment (0.558 and 0.538, respectively). ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA normalized and adjusted based on the heavy polysome content (see data processing) log2Signal	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 4 µg total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Each sample was added to a hybridization solution containing 100 mm 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, 1M Na+, and 20 mm of EDTA in the presence of 0.01% Tween-20. Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 45∞C.	7-day-old seedlings were subjected to heat-stress by incubation at 38∫C for 45 min. For the control conditions, plates taken directly from the growth chamber were used. Seedlings were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to powder and stored at -80∫C.	Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 seeds were surface sterilized using 0.05% Tween-20 and ethanol for 5 min, sown on MS medium plates (0.9% agar, pH 5.7) and kept at 4∫ degrees in darkness for 2 days for stratification. Plates were vertically oriented in a growth chamber under a 16 h light and 8 h dark cycle for 7 days at 22∫C.	Polysomes isolation by differential centrifugation was performed by slight modification of a previously described protocol (Kawaguchi et al., 2004)†. Briefly, 2 gr of frozen tissue was thawed in 2 ml of polysome extraction buffer (200 mm Tris (pH 9.0), 200 mm KCl, 26 mm MgCl2, 25 mm EGTA, 100 µm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 µg ml‚àí1 cycloheximide, 50 µg ml‚àí1 chloramphenicol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) Tween-20, 1% (v/v) NP-40, 2% (v/v) polyoxyethylene-10-tridecyl-ether, 1% (v/v) deoxycholic acid). The crude cell extract was clarified by centrifugation at 13,500 g for 15 min at 4∫C and the OD260 of the supernatant determined. Approximately 7000 units (OD260) were layered on top of a 10 ml 15-40% (w/v) sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 250,000 g for 3:40 h at 4∫C (SW41Ti rotor, Beckman). 16 fractions of 600 µl were manually collected and RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer‚Äôs protocol. The polysome profile (OD260) and the verification of the quality of the polysome preparation by electrophoretic analysis of rRNA distribution were evaluated. Quantitative polysome gradient fractionation was performed using three biological samples.	Each microarray was washed and stained with streptavidin‚Äìphycoerythrin in a Fluidics station 450 (Affymetrix) and scanned at 2.5-Œºm resolution in a GeneChipÆ Scanner 3000 7G system (Affymetrix).
