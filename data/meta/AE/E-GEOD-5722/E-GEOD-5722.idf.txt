Experiment Description	"Ozone is known to induce gene expression in plants. The roles of the induced genes and the molecular basis for the induction however largely remain to be elucidated. We will expose 2 week-old Arabidopsis seedlings to 200 ppb ozone for 1 h. RNA will be extracted from control and ozone-fumigated seedlings 3 h following the end of the fumigation period. The induction of the known anti-oxidant enzyme GST will be confirmed prior to submission of the RNA samples to GARNet. Changes in gene expression will be assessed by hybridising microarrays with fluorescently labelled cDNA prepared from control and ozone-fumigated seedlings. The role of selected genes will be inferred from their sequence and further established by over expression under the control of the 35S or cell-specific promoters and by searching for mutants among single transposon or T-DNA insertion collections. Plants will be analysed on the basis of traits that are known to be affected by ozone including growth, flowering and stomatal responses. In addition, the ozone calcium signature we have reported previously (Clayton et al.1999) will be studied by crossing transgenic or mutant plants with apoaequorin or yellow cameleon 2.1-transformed plants.

Protocol Description	Fumigation with 500ppb Ozone for 6 hours from 10.30am in sealed chambers inside the growth cabinet. Flow rate was 910ml/min. The ozone was bubbled through water before entering fumigation chambers to humidify the gas. Seelings were fumigated in their growth plates and extracted immediately after fumigation.	Fumigation with scrubbed air (filtered through charcoal and purafill)  for 6 hours from 10.30am in sealed chambers inside the growth cabinet. Flow rate was 910ml/min. The air was bubbled through water before entering fumigation chambers to humidify the gas. Seelings were fumigated in their growth plates and RNA extracted immediately after fumigation.
