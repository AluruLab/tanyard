Silique occurs over a highly predictable time frame and as a consequence it may be easier to identify the molecular events that are critical for the process to take place than in systems such as leaf senescence. The material will be collected from 20 Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia plants  (NASC order number N1093) grown under controlled conditions specified under NASC protocol: Baseline sample preparation. Two pods will be collected from each plant and pooled from 20 plants to reduce sampling variability. It is intended that 3 replicates of the experiment will be submitted.  The RNA will be extracted from mature green silique tissues of 10 days after anthesis and senescing pod tissues of 20 days after anthesis using lithium chloride extraction protocol and cleaned with Qiagen RNAeasy column.
