Experiment Description	"Analysis of transcriptional changes upon persistent heat stress with emphasis on epigenetically regulated genes 3 week old seedling grown in vitro were exposed to 37oC for 30 h (LHS). After heat stress, plants were analyzed immediately (R0) or allowed to recover at ambient temperature for 2 days (R2)."

Protocol Description	Plants were germinated and grown for three weeks under in vitro conditions under long day light regime at 22oC.	"Three hours after beginning of the light phase, plants were transferred to 37oC for 30 h, then transferred back to 22oC. Mock controls were kept at 22oC."
