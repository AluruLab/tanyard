It is an obligate biotrophic parasite, colonising leaf epidermal cells to obtain nutrients from the plant cells without killing them. Syringolin A (sylA), a circular peptide secreted by the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, triggers a hypersensitive cell death reaction (HR) at infection sites when sprayed onto powdery mildew infected wheat which essentially eradicates the fungus. The rational was to identify genes whose expression was specifically regulated during HR, i.e. genes that might be involved in the switch of compatibility to incompatibility.<br><\/br>Powdery mildew-infected or uninfected plants were treated with syringolin two days after infection and plant material for RNA extraction was collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 hours after treatment (hat), resulting in an early (2 and 4 hat) and late pool (8 and 12 hat). Plant material that was uninfected prior to syringolin treatment was collected 8 and 12 hat (late pool of uninfected plant material), and 1 hat, respectively."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Kathrin Michel","role":"submitter","email":"kmichel@botinst.unizh.ch"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":16941219,"authors":"Michel K, Abderhalden O, Bruggmann R, Dudler R","title":"Transcriptional changes in powdery mildew infected wheat and Arabidopsis leaves undergoing syringolin-triggered hypersensitive cell death at infection sites","status":"published"},{"accession":26493993,"authors":"Kaurilind E, Xu E, Brosch√© M.","title":"A genetic framework for H2O2 induced cell death in Arabidopsis thaliana.","doi":"10.1186\/s12864-015-1964-8","issue":"None","pages":837,"year":2015}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["12-14 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"growth condition","value":["powdery mildew infected","uninfected"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["none","syringolin"]},{"name":"dose","value":["20 micromolar"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["powdery mildew infected","uninfected"]},{"name":"time","value":["1 hour","2 to 4 hour","8 to 12 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":24,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1137227,"accession":"P-MTAB-21127"},{"id":1137231,"accession":"P-MTAB-21128"},{"id":1137223,"accession":"P-MTAB-21119"},{"id":1137225,"accession":"P-MTAB-21129"},{"id":79337,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4[]"},{"id":1137229,"accession":"P-MTAB-21124"},{"id":1137234,"accession":"P-MTAB-21123"},{"id":1137224,"accession":"P-MTAB-21126"},{"id":1137226,"accession":"P-MTAB-21131"},{"id":163,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:MAS4:ExpressionCall"},{"id":1137235,"accession":"P-MTAB-21130"},{"id":1137230,"accession":"P-MTAB-21125"},{"id":1137232,"accession":"P-MTAB-21120"},{"id":1137233,"accession":"P-MTAB-21122"},{"id":1137228,"accession":"P-MTAB-21121"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":24,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":24,"isderived":0}]}]}}
