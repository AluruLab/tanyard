Investigation Title	Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and pskr1-5 transcriptome upon the compatible interaction with Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and pskr1-5 transcriptome upon the compatible interaction with Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis
Experiment Description	We used Arabidopsis full-genome microarrays to characterize plant transcript accumulations in wild-type plants and pskr1-5 mutants, 3 days after water treatment and inoculation with the biotrophic oomycete downy mildew pathogen, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. In two independent experiments, cotyledons from the wild-type Wassilewskija (WS) ecotype and from the pskr1-5 mutant were treated with water, or inoculated with the H. arabidopsidis isolate Emwa1 to establish a compatible interaction. Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays were used to profile Arabidopsis transcript accumulations at 3 days after onset of treatment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA log2 Signal intensity	standard Affymetrix protocol	Seeds from A. thaliana ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) were sown on a soil/sand mixture, stratified for 3 days at 4 °C, and then grown under a 12 h photoperiod in a growth chamber at 20 °C.	Background adjustment, quantile normalization, and summarization of raw data were performed with the Affymetrix Power Tools APT1.14.4 software package.	standard Affymetrix protocol	For infection, 10-day-old plants were spray-inoculated to saturation with a spore suspension of 40,000 spores/ml (strain Emwa1)	In two independent experiments, cotyledons from the ecotype Wassilewskija (Ws-4) wild-type or pskr1-5 mutant plants were treated with water, or inoculated with H. arabidopsidis to establish a compatible interaction. Total RNA was extracted from about 100 mg of these tissues according to a procedure described (Laroche-Raynal et al., Plant Science Letters 35, 139-146,1984).	standard Affymetrix protocol
