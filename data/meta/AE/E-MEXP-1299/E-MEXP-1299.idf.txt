Experiment Description	Arabidopsis thaliana circadian and light signaling mutants have long hypocotyls under light/dark cycles.  In order to determine if aberrant hypocotyl growth is due to time of day specific miss-expression of growth associated transcripts we conducted time course microarray experiments in the lux-2, lhy and phyB-9 mutants. The mutants and their parental genotypes were grown on plates under either intermediate days (12 hours light and 12 hours dark) for lux-2, or short day (8 hrs of light and 16 hrs of dark) for lhy and phyB-9, for seven days and tissue was collected every four hours over one day.

Protocol Description	50-100 Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were vapor sterilized overnight. At 8 A.M., seeds were imbibed on plates containing ½ LS media with 0.8% agar at pH 5.8. Seeds were stratified for 3 days at 4°C and at 8 A.M. on the fourth day they were released into short day conditions of 8 hours light (100 µmol/m2s) and 16 hours dark at 22°C. After seven days of growth, plants were harvested starting at the dark to light transition of the eighth day.	Seedlings (50-100) from individual plates were collected every four hours.	Collected tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen in 2 ml eppindorph tubes with three steel ball bearings and stored at -80°C. Frozen tissue was disrupted on a Retsch shaker under liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using QIAGEN RNAeasy kits with on column DNAase treatment and resuspended in 35 µl RNAase-free H2O.
