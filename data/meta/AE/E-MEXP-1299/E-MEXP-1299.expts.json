In order to determine if aberrant hypocotyl growth is due to time of day specific miss-expression of growth associated transcripts we conducted time course microarray experiments in the lux-2, lhy and phyB-9 mutants. The mutants and their parental genotypes were grown on plates under either intermediate days (12 hours light and 12 hours dark) for lux-2, or short day (8 hrs of light and 16 hrs of dark) for lhy and phyB-9, for seven days and tissue was collected every four hours over one day."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Todd P Michael","role":"submitter","email":"tmichael@waksman.rutgers.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"authors":"Todd P.
