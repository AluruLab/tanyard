EIN3 was identified as a plant-specific transcription factor and its protein level rapidly increases upon ethylene treatment. We found that activation of EIN3 and EIN3-like 1 (EIL1) is both necessary and sufficient for ethylene-induced enhancement of seedling greening, as well as repression of the accumulation of protochlorophyllide, a phototoxic intermediate of chlorophyll synthesis. Therefore, comparation of the Wt and ein3-1eil1-1 mutant etiolated seedlings' gene expression at genome wide will be helpfull for us  to find the EIN3\/EIL1 target genes in chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway. Here we used microarrays to detail the global gene expression under the regulation of EIN3\/EIL1.Here we used microarrays to detail the global gene expression under the regulation of EIN3\/EIL1. Experiment Overall Design: 4 days dark grown Wt and ein3-1eil1-1 (AT3G20770, AT2G27050) double mutant seedlings were collected for isolation RNA. Standard Affymetrix protocal and 25K Affymetrix chip (ATH1) were used for Microarry hybridization."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Shangwei Zhong","role":"submitter","email":"zhshweiwh@163.com"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19948955,"authors":"Zhong S, Zhao M, Shi T, Shi H, An F, Zhao Q, Guo H.","title":"EIN3\/EIL1 cooperate with PIF1 to prevent photo-oxidation and to promote greening of Arabidopsis seedlings.","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0907670106","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["4 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["Col-0","ein3-1; eil1-1"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["Col-0","ein3-1; eil1-1"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":447771,"accession":"P-G18631-3"},{"id":447775,"accession":"P-G18631-4"},{"id":447773,"accession":"P-G18631-1"},{"id":447774,"accession":"P-G18631-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":447772,"accession":"P-G18631-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
