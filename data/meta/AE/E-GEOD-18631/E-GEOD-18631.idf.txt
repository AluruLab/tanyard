Experiment Description	Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that plays important roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. EIN3 was identified as a plant-specific transcription factor and its protein level rapidly increases upon ethylene treatment. We found that activation of EIN3 and EIN3-like 1 (EIL1) is both necessary and sufficient for ethylene-induced enhancement of seedling greening, as well as repression of the accumulation of protochlorophyllide, a phototoxic intermediate of chlorophyll synthesis. Therefore, comparation of the Wt and ein3-1eil1-1 mutant etiolated seedlings' gene expression at genome wide will be helpfull for us  to find the EIN3/EIL1 target genes in chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway. Here we used microarrays to detail the global gene expression under the regulation of EIN3/EIL1.Here we used microarrays to detail the global gene expression under the regulation of EIN3/EIL1. Experiment Overall Design: 4 days dark grown Wt and ein3-1eil1-1 (AT3G20770, AT2G27050) double mutant seedlings were collected for isolation RNA. Standard Affymetrix protocal and 25K Affymetrix chip (ATH1) were used for Microarry hybridization.

Protocol Description	After 3 days cold treatment, Arabidopsis seeds which plated on MS medium, were given 4 hour light for germination induction then grown at 22ÂºC for 4 days in the darkness.	Dark grown seedlings.	Total RNA was isolated using a TRIZOL Reagent system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100.
