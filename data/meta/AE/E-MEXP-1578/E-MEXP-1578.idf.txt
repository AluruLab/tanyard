Protocol Type	pool	nucleic_acid_extraction	grow	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction			
Protocol Description	The approx. 50-100 mg of leaves (3 weeks after germination) of wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis lines were extracted.	"Each samples are preserved with grinding ball in 2-ml tube and stored at the deep freezer. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Kit (QIAGEN). 1. Grind sample under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder using Mixer Mill MM 301(Retsch). 2. Add 450 µl of Buffer RLT (1% 2-mercaptoethanol) to a maximum of 100 mg of tissue powder. Vortex vigorously. 3. Apply lysate to the QIAshredder spin column sitting in a 2-ml collection tube, and centrifuge for 2 min at maximum speed. Transfer flow-through fraction from QIAshredder to a new tube without disturbing the cell-debris pellet in the collection tube. 4. Add 0.5 volumes 100% ethanol to the cleared lysate and mix well by pipetting. 5.&#12288;Apply sample including any precipitate which may have formed,&#12288;onto an RNeasy mini spin column sitting in a 2-ml collection tube. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000 x g. 6. Pipet 700 µl Buffer RW1 onto the RNeasy column, and centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000 x g to wash. 7. Transfer RNeasy column into a new 2-ml collection tube. Pipet 500 µl Buffer RPE onto the RNeasy column, and centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000 x g. 8. Add 500 µl Buffer RPE to the RNeasy column, and centrifuge for 2 min at maximum speed to dry the RNeasy membrane. 9. Transfer RNeasy column into a new 1.5-ml collection tube, and pipet 30 of RNase-free water directly onto the RNeasy membrane. Centrifuge for 1 min at 8000 x g.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"	"Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (accession Colombia) and mutants (T-DNA insertion lines) were grown in a prefabricated room type chamber at 22oC and a 16 h photoperiod on agar-solidified 1/2 MS medium containing 1% sucrose.<br>(Parameters: start time = 3, time unit = weeks, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C, media = 1/2 MS medium containing 1% sucrose)"	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
