Heynh., accession Landsberg erecta) were grown in growth chambers at 70% humidity and daily cycles of 16 h light at 21Â°C and 8 h darkness at 21Â°C. Plant material used for the experiments was pooled from 12 plants. Samples contained complete flower buds. About 10% of the tissues for each sample were cleared and analyzed by microscopy to ensure that homogenous developmental stages were harvested. The entire experiment was performed twice providing independent biological replicates..
