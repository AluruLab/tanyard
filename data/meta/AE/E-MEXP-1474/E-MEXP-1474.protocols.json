Flowers were collected at the same daily time (4-5 PM) to reduce circadian effects. Floral stages were assigned according to Smyth et al. (1990).  Flowers at stage 12 (“petals level with long stamens”), 13 (“petal visible, anthesis”) and early stage 15 (“stigma extends above long anthers”, S15a) were collected from the primary inflorescence of the same plant.  Flowers of the same stage from the same plant batch were pooled as one independent sample. Three separately grown plant batches formed three biological replications. Flowers at stage S15c were ~24-h older than those at stage S15a. Flowers one position above S15c flowers were termed Stage S15b. Flowers at Stages 15b and 15c were harvested from different plant batches six-months later. Flowers were fixed, processed and paraffin-embedded according to Cai and Lashbrook (2006).  Protocols of Cai and Lashbrook (2006) were used for longitudinal paraffin sectioning, LCM and RNA isolation, amplification and biotin-labeling.  Paraffin sections were mounted onto adhesive-coated slides (Cai and Lashbrook, 2006) with a paraffin tape transfer system (Instrumedics, Hackensack, NJ, USA). Prior to LCM, tape was carefully removed from slides submerged in xylenes using forceps. AZ microdissection using the Pix-Cell IITM LCM system employed CapSureTM Macro LCM caps (Arcturus Engineering, Mountain View, CA, USA).
