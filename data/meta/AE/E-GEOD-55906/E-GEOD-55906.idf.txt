Investigation Title	Expression data from WT (Ws-2), CBF1,2,3, and CBF2Œîc (a truncated CBF2) overexpression						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from WT (Ws-2), CBF1,2,3, and CBF2Œîc (a truncated CBF2) overexpression
Experiment Description	CBF1, CBF2 and CBF3 regulons comprise nearly identical gene sets The vast majority of CBF2 regulon genes were down-regulated less that 50% by overexpression of CBF2Œîc, a truncated version of CBF2 We used Affymetrix GeneChips to examine the CBF regulons of plants overexpressing CBF1, CBF2, CBF3 and a truncated version of CBF2, CBF2Œîc.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with LIMMA package of Bioconductor using GC-RMA normalization procedure. ID_REF =  VALUE = GCRMA-normalized log2 expression signal	RNA was amplified and biotinylated using a MessageAmp kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol	Hybridization and washing were carried out according to the Gene Chip manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix)	Cold treatment was for 24 h at 4‚Å∞C under constant light of ~35 µmol m-2 sec-1	Plants were grown on Gamborg's B-5 medium solidified with agar at 22‚Å∞C under constant light at ~100 Œºmol m-2 sec-1 for 11 d	RNA was extracted using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen)	Scan protocols were carried out according to the Gene Chip manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix)
Protocol Type	normalization data transformation protocol	labelling protocol	hybridization protocol	sample treatment protocol	growth protocol	nucleic acid extraction protocol	array scanning protocol
