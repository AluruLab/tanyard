One drawback in the analysis of transformed protoplast suspensions is that they are a heterogeneous mix of cells that have and have not been successfully transfected. To overcome this problem, we have developed a system that employs a fluorescent positive selection marker in combination with flow cytometric analysis as well as fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate responses in the transfected protoplasts exclusively. This recombinase-compatible system enables high-throughput screening of genetic circuitry. Moreover, the use of FACS allows in depth downstream analysis. Lastly, over-expression is an effective means to dissect regulatory networks, especially where redundancy exists. Here, this system has been applied to the study of auxin signaling in order to investigate reporter gene activation and genome-wide transcriptional changes in response to manipulation of the auxin-response network. We have transiently over-expressed dominant negative mutant isoforms of Aux\/IAA transcription factors (IAA7mII and IAA19mII; Tiwari et al., 2001) in Arabidopsis Pwer::GFP root protoplasts, making use of a RFP fluorescent positive selection marker and FACS to isolate the dually labeled (IAAnmII expressing and Pwer::GFP-positive) cells. We have compared the transcriptional differences between an empty vector control, IAA7mII and IAA19mII protoplasts that had either been treated with 5microM IAA or mock-treated for 3 hours. Experiment Overall Design: 18 samples with 3 replicates for each condition and transformation vector: 3x empty vector mock treated, 3x empty vector IAA treated, 3x IAA7mII over-expressor mock treated, 3x IAA7mII over-expressor IAA treated, 3x IAA19mII over-expressor mock treated and 3x IAA19mII over-expressor IAA treated."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Kenneth David Birnbaum","role":"submitter","email":"ken.birnbaum@nyu.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19168642,"authors":"Bargmann BO, Birnbaum KD.","title":"Positive fluorescent selection permits precise, rapid, and in-depth overexpression analysis in plant protoplasts","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"cell type","value":["protoplast"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["pBeaconRFP_IAA19mll overexpressor","pBeaconRFP_IAA7mll overexpressor","pMON999_mRFP control vector"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["indole-3-acetic acid","none"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["pBeaconRFP_IAA19mll overexpressor","pBeaconRFP_IAA7mll overexpressor","pMON999_mRFP control vector"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1125013,"accession":"P-G13783-4"},{"id":1125015,"accession":"P-G13783-2"},{"id":1125012,"accession":"P-G13783-3"},{"id":1125014,"accession":"P-G13783-1"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
