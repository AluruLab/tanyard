The SAM and the RAM in the esd7-1 seedlings were found to exhibit an altered disposition that might correlate with the abnormal expression pattern of SAM and RAM marker genes. esd7-1 showed higher sensitivity to DNA damaging reagents than wild type plants and altered expression of genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms by homologous recombination. Moreover, esd7 early flowering phenotype requires functional FT and SOC1 proteins and might be also related to the mis-regulation of AG and AG-like gene expression found in esd7. Loci involved in the modulation of the chromatin structural dynamics, such as TFL2 and EBS, which negatively regulate FT expression, were found to interact genetically with ESD7, and the carboxy terminus of ESD7 interacted with TFL2 in vitro. Besides, fasciata2 (fas2) mutations suppressed esd7 early flowering phenotype and INCURVATA 2 (ICU2) was found to be epistatic to ESD7.  Discrete regions of the chromatin of FT and AG loci were enriched in activating epigenetic marks in the esd7-1 mutant. We concluded that ESD7 might be participating in processes involved in chromatin-mediated cellular memory. We used microarrays to evaluate the genes whose expression was mis-regulated by the esd7-1 mutation Ler and esd7-1 14-d-old seedlings grown under SD photoperiods, were collected 8 h after dawn for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The experimental design comprised three replicates of each genotype and each replicate corresponded to an RNA extraction of an independent pool of plants."}],"provider":[{"contact":"José M Martínez-Zapater","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Leticia López-González","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jose A Jarillo","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Iván del Olmo","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Manuel A Piñeiro","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Maria M Martín-Trillo","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jose Antonio Jarillo","role":"submitter","email":"jarillo@inia.es"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19947980,"authors":"del Olmo I, López-González L, Martín-Trillo MM, Martínez-Zapater JM, Piñeiro M, Jarillo JA.","title":"EARLY IN SHORT DAYS 7 (ESD7) encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon and is required for flowering repression through a mechanism involving epigenetic gene silencing.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["14 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Landsberg ecotype"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["esd7-1","wild type"]},{"category":"growth condition","value":["short day photoperiod"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["esd7-1","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1132906,"accession":"P-GSE18603-4"},{"id":1132901,"accession":"P-GSE18603-8"},{"id":1132904,"accession":"P-GSE18603-5"},{"id":1132907,"accession":"P-GSE18603-2"},{"id":1132903,"accession":"P-GSE18603-6"},{"id":1132905,"accession":"P-GSE18603-3"},{"id":1132902,"accession":"P-GSE18603-7"},{"id":1132900,"accession":"P-GSE18603-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
