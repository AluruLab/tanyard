Comment[Submitted Name]	Comparison of low water potential (drought)-regulated gene expression in wild type (Col-0) and the hai1-2 (At5g59220) mutant							
Experiment Description	The Clade A PP2C Highly ABA-Induced1 (HAI1, At5g59220) is strongly up-regulated by low water potential in an ABA-dependent manner.  Using knockout mutants of hai1, we found that HAI1 functions as a negative regulator of low water potential-induced proline and osmoregulatory solute accumulation.  We also found a relatively weak and limited interaction of HAI1 with the RCAR/PYL family of ABA receptors.  This, plus its induced expression, suggest that HAI1 remains active during stress and attenuates specific aspects of drought response.  Microarray experiments were used to identify genes differentially expressed in hai1-2 (SALK_108282) versus wild type under both unstress control conditions and after low water potential (i.e., drought, water deficit).  A relatively long term (96 h) low water potential treatment was used as phenotypes of hai1-2 were most apparent after this longer term low water potential treatment. Seven-day-old seedlings of wild type (Col-0) or hai1-2 were transferred from agar plates of control media to low water potential stress (PEG-infused agar plates at -1.2 MPa) or to fresh control media (-0.25 Mpa). Samples (whole seedlings) were collected 96 h after transfer. Three independent experiments were conducted with one sample of each treatment (wild type stress and control, hai1-2 stress and control) collected from each experiment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = <br>Detection p-value = 	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16.5 hr at 45C on the GeneChip ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Seedlings were grown on agar plates containing half-strength MS salts and 2 mM MES buffer. No sugar was added to the media.  Plates were positioned vertically for seeding growth along the surface of the agar and were kept in a growth chamber at 25 C, continuous light at 85-100 micromol photons m-2 sec-1 and high (80-90%) relative humidity.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 500.	GeneChips were scanned using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.	Seven-day-old seedlings were transferred from agar plates of control media to agar plates of fresh control media (water potential -0.25 MPa) or low water potential agar plates (-1.2 MPa).  Low water potential plates were prepared by overlaying a solution of polyethylene glycol (molecular weight 8000) on the control agar plates and equilibrating overnight.  Details of PEG-agar plate preparation can be found in Verslues et al., Plant J 45:523-539 2006.  After transfer to treatment plates, seedlings were returned to growth chamber for 96 h before sample collection.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 701021 Rev. 5, Affymetrix).
