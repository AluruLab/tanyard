Investigation Title	CYTOKININ HYPERSENSITIVE1 (CKH1) and CKH2 affect to cytokinin responses in tissue culture							
Comment[Submitted Name]	CYTOKININ HYPERSENSITIVE1 (CKH1) and CKH2 affect to cytokinin responses in tissue culture							
Experiment Description	Analysis of calli derived from the wild type (Ler), the ckh1 and ckh2 mutants cultured on media in the absence of cytokinin (control), in the presence of low (25 ng/ml kinetin) or high (200 ng/ml kinetin) levels of cytokinin, or in the presence of Trichostatin A (TSA). In these conditions, a constant 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was included as an auxin. Hypocotyl segments of the wild type (Ler), ckh1-1 and ckh2-1 mutants were cultured for 3 days on media containing 100 ng/ml 2,4-D in the absence of kinetin or in the presence of low (25 ng/ml) or high (200 ng/ml) kinetin or 100ng/ml TSA, and then collected and rapidly frozen by liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted by using an RNeasy plant kit (Qiagen; USA), and 10 µg of total RNA was used for target preparation by using

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Signal<br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Standard Affymetrix procedures	The sterilized seeds were put on germination medium (GM) and stored at 4ºC for at least 1 day, and then moved to growth chambers at 23ºC. Seedlings to be used for the excision of hypocotyl segments for callus induction were grown for 10days under dim light (2.5 µEm-2s-1).	The data were analyzed with Affymetrix Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0).	Standard Affymetrix procedures	Callus induction medium (CIM) were GM supplemented with 1 mg/liter biotin, 100 ng/ml 2,4-D as auxin and kinetin as cytokinin at the specified concentrations or TSA. Hypocotyl segments of seedlings were cultured for 3 days on CIM under comtinuous illumination (100 µEm-2s-1) at 23ºC , and then collected and rapidly frozen by liquid nitrogen.	Total RNA was prepared using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 microg total RNA.
