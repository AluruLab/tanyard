Defense-related genes were highly induced in JAV1 RNAi plants compared to wild-type plants in response to wounding or jasmonate treatments. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying JAV1 effects on expression of genes involving in defense response, lipid metabolism and regulating transcription. For the Affymetrix microarray assay with 100 uM MeJA treatment, 21-day-old seedlings grown in MS medium were treated with 100 Î¼M MeJA for various time periods (0, 1, and 4 hours). For the Affymetrix microarray assay with wounding treatment, JAV1 RNAi line Ri17 versus wild-type was utilized after mechanical wounding for various time periods. Four rosette leaves from 21-day-old plants were crushed across the midrib with a forceps. About 30% of each leaf was damaged. Wounded leaves were harvested at various time periods (0, 0.5, and 1 hour) for RNA extraction. Control plants were untreated and leaves were harvested for RNA extraction."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Po Hu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Wu Zhou","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Daoxin Xie","role":"submitter","email":"hup06@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn"},{"contact":"Daoxin Xie","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"cultivar","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["JAV1 RNAi transgenic plant (Ri17)","Wild type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["Arabidopsis leaves"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["JAV1 RNAi transgenic plant (Ri17)","Wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":10,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":746960,"accession":"P-GSE45662-7"},{"id":746961,"accession":"P-GSE45662-8"},{"id":746966,"accession":"P-GSE45662-2"},{"id":746959,"accession":"P-GSE45662-1"},{"id":746962,"accession":"P-GSE45662-6"},{"id":746963,"accession":"P-GSE45662-5"},{"id":746965,"accession":"P-GSE45662-4"},{"id":746964,"accession":"P-GSE45662-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":10,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":10,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":10,"isderived":0}]}]}}
