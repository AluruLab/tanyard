Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptional profiles of Arabidopsis stomataless mutants
Experiment Description	Stomataless Arabidopsis thaliana mutants spch-3 and mute-3 are extreme dwarfs but can produce cotyledons and tiny leaves, providing a system to interrogate plant life in the absence of stomata. To this end, we compared the transcriptomes of mutant cotyledons lacking SPCH or MUTE functions, and therefore lacking stomata, with those of wild-type, stomata-bearing Col-0 accession. RNA was obtained from 21 days old cotyledons collected from 9 independent biological replicates per genotype. These were pooled in 3x3 replicates and used to hybridize Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.

Protocol Description	Surface sterilized seeds were plated in Petri dishes containing MS medium (M552, Sigma) supplemented with 1% sucrose and 0.8 %  plant agar (S0809, Duchefa Biochemies), pH 5.7. Seeds were stratified in the dark for 48 h at 4°C, transferred to a growth chamber with a 16 h photoperiod, 21°C, 60 % relative humidity and 70 µmol photon cm-2 s-1.	Approximately 30 cotyledons (10-15 mg) were collected, immediately shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC until RNA extraction. For each mutant seedling, maintained in heterozygous stocks, one cotyledon was phenotyped and the other collected at 21 dpg.	RNA was extracted with a Trizol/RNeasy procedure. Frozen cotyledons were homogenized with a pestle, 800 µl of Trizol (15596-026, Invitrogen) were added to the powder and incubated for 5 min at room temperature and RNA was extracted with chloroform and cleaned with Qiagen MinElute (RNeasy mini kit 74104, QIAGEN) columns following the manufacturer’s instructions. Prior to elution, the columns were treated with DNase (RNase-Free DNase Set 79254, QIAGEN). RNA integrity and quality was tested by electrophoresis with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Brolingen).	cDNA was synthesized from 4 µg of total RNA using One-cycle target labeling and control reagents (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) to produce biotin labeled cRNA. The cRNA preparation (15 µg) were fragmented at 94ºC for 35 min into 35-200 bases in length.	Three biological replicates for each condition were independently hybridized. If the quality control was correct, then 10 µg of fragmented cRNA were hybridized to the Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), containing 22500 transcript variants from 24000 well -characterized Arabidopsis thaliana genes. Each sample was added to a hybridization solution containing 100mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, 1 M Na+, and 20mM of EDTA in the presence of 0.01% of Tween-20 to a final cRNA concentration of 0.05 µg/ml. Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 45ºC . Each microarray was washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin in a Fluidics station 450 (Affymetrix).	Microarrays were scanned at 2.5 µm resolution in a GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G System (Affymetrix) Data analyses were performed using GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS).	Background correction, quantile normalization and expression data averaging and Log2 transformation were performed by Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) (Irizarry et al., 2003).
