Experiment Description	This microarray experiment serves to identify the genes in the Arabidopsis genome that are regulated by carbon and light signaling interactions in 7 day dark grown seedlings.  The expression profile of wild-type will be compared to the cli186 mutant, a mutant defective in carbon and light signaling.  Plants of both the wild-type and cli186 genotypes are treated with the following light (L) and carbon (C) treatments: -C-L, +C-L, +C+L, -C+L.  Comparison of the expression profiles under all treatments will help to identify genes that are misregulated in carbon and/or light treatments in the cli186 mutant.

Protocol Description	Seven day etiolated seedlings of the AS-hyg genotype and the cli186 mutant were germinated and maintained on basal MS media that contained 1% sucrose.  These plants were maintained in the dark for 7 days and three hours.  Following this treatment, whole seedlings were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use.	Seven day etiolated seedlings of the AS-hyg genotype and the cli186 mutant were germinated and maintained on basal MS media that contained no sucrose.  These plants were maintained in the dark for 7 days and then treated with white light for an additional three hours.  Following this treatment, whole seedlings were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use.	Seven day etiolated seedlings of the AS-hyg genotype and the cli186 mutant were germinated and maintained on basal MS media that contained no sucrose.  These plants were maintained in the dark for 7 days and three hours.

Seven day etiolated seedlings of the AS-hyg genotype and the cli186 mutant were germinated and maintained on basal MS media that contained 1% sucrose.  These plants were maintained in the dark for 7 days and were then treated with white light for an additional three hours.  Following this treatment, whole seedlings were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use.	Arabidopsis thaliana seeds of AS-hyg genotype (Columbia ecotype) and the FN-created cli186 mutants were surface-sterilized, plated on designated media and stratified for 48 hours at 4C. Plants were grown on tissue culture plates under continuous darkness at a constant temperature of 23 C on basal Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium that was supplemented with 2 mM KNO3 and +/- 1% sucrose.  After 7 days dark growth half of the plants (AS-hyg and cli186) on 0% or 1% sucrose were placed into white light for 3 hours while other half of seedlings on 0% or 1% sucrose plates were maintained in the dark. 	Total RNA was isolated from whole plants using a phenol extraction protocol as described in Jackson and Larkins (1976) Influence of Ionic strength, pH and chelation of divalent metals on isolation of polyribosomes from tobacco leaves.
