Protocol Description	Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in short day conditions (10h L/14h D, 20Â&deg;C). These conditions were applied in order to prevent the plant from entering the reproductive stage. Using micro scissors, plants were collected from 14 days old whose cotyledons and hypocotyls were removed.	Total RNA (15 Î¼g) was extracted with the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen).	Total RNA (15 Î¼g) was extracted with the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Labeled cRNA was prepared and hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips, according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
