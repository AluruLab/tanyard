Investigation Title	Expression data from WT, sid2-1						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from WT, sid2-1						
Experiment Description	Salicylic acid (SA) levels increase in Arabidopsis upon exposure to low temperature for more than a week.  This cold-induced SA biosynthesis was found to proceed through the isochorismate synthase (ICS) pathway. The sid2-1 mutant is deficient in ICS1 and does not make SA at low temperature. We used microarray analysis to examine the genes differentially regulated by low temperature that were dependent on SA We used the sid2-1 mutant and a WT control at 22⁰C and after 3 weeks at 4⁰C. All samples were in triplicate.
