Protocol Description	Arabidopsis wild type and MKK9DD seedlings were grown on 0.5x MS media for 7 days, and WT seedlings were then transferred to either MS or LP (low phosphate) medium and grown for an additional 3 days.  MKK9DD seedlings were then transferred to MS media with or without DEX and grown for an additional day.	Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions.	RNA purification and chip hybridization were done using Affymetrix Microarray Services (CapitalBio Co., Beijing).
