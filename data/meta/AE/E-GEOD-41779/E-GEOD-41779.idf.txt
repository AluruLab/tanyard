Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis leaves either under electric current injection or with distal wound against untreated controls									
Comment[Submitted Name]	Current injection and distal wound response in Arabidopsis thaliana									
Experiment Description	These data represent two experiments, one on wounding leaves and one based on injecting current into leaves. We first analyzed transcript levels in leaf 13 when leaf 8 was wounded. Transcripts levels in leaf 8 were then analyzed after current injection. Sample handling and normalisations were identical between experiments. Leaf 8 was wounded with forceps. 1 h later, leaf 13 was harvested. Unwounded leaf 13 was used for controls. For current injected (40 μA, 10 s) versus non-current injected leaves, samples were harvested 1h after current injection. Non-current injected leaves used as control. In each case leaf 8 was used.

Protocol Description	Gene level normalized expression signals were calculated from Affymetrix CEL files using RMA (Irizarry et al., 2003) împlemented in the Affymetrix Power Tools software package (Affymetrix). ID_REF =  VALUE = Log2 normalized expression signal	Total RNA (300ng) was amplified using the MessageAmp™ II-Biotin Enhanced Single Round aRNA Amplification Kit (AM1791, Ambion). 12.5�g of the resulting biotinlabelled cRNA was chemically fragmented.	Affymetrix ATH1 (batch 1211501) arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were hybridized according to the protocol described in Affymetrix GeneChip� Expression Analysis Manual (Fluidics protocol FS450_0007).	Current (40 μA, 10 s) injected into the petiole of leaf 8 and the lamina was harvested 1 h later.	The plants were not wounded. These were control samples for wounding experiments.	40% of the apex of leaf 8 was wounded. 1 h later leaf 13 was harvested.	These were controls for current injection experiments. Platinum wire were placed in the petiole of leaf 8 but no current was injected. The lamina was harvested for analysis.	Arabidopsis thaliana accession Col-0, was soil-grown (one plant per 7 cm diameter pot) for 5 weeks with 10 h light (100 �E sec-1 m-2), 70% humidity; day 22�C, night 18�C.	Total RNAs from leaves were isolated and purified with RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagene, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	The arrays were scanned using the GeneChip� Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix) and raw data was extracted from the scanned images
