We first analyzed transcript levels in leaf 13 when leaf 8 was wounded. Transcripts levels in leaf 8 were then analyzed after current injection. Sample handling and normalisations were identical between experiments. Leaf 8 was wounded with forceps. 1 h later, leaf 13 was harvested. Unwounded leaf 13 was used for controls. For current injected (40 Î¼A, 10 s) versus non-current injected leaves, samples were harvested 1h after current injection. Non-current injected leaves used as control. In each case leaf 8 was used."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Seyed Ali Reza Mousavi","role":"submitter","email":"sar.mosavi@gmail.com"},{"contact":"Adeline Chauvin","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Stephan Kellenberger","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Francois Pascaud","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Edward E Farmer","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Seyed A Mousavi","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23969459,"authors":"Mousavi SA, Chauvin A, Pascaud F, Kellenberger S, Farmer EE","title":"GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE genes mediate leaf-to-leaf wound signalling."}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf 13","leaf 8"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["40 microampere of electric current for 10 second","leaf 8 wounded","no electric current injection","unwounded"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1126754,"accession":"P-GSE41779-1"},{"id":1126759,"accession":"P-GSE41779-3"},{"id":1126763,"accession":"P-GSE41779-2"},{"id":1126761,"accession":"P-GSE41779-9"},{"id":1126762,"accession":"P-GSE41779-8"},{"id":1126757,"accession":"P-GSE41779-5"},{"id":1126758,"accession":"P-GSE41779-10"},{"id":1126760,"accession":"P-GSE41779-4"},{"id":1126755,"accession":"P-GSE41779-7"},{"id":1126756,"accession":"P-GSE41779-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
