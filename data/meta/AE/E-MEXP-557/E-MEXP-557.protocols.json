Double-stranded cDNA was purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and the aqueous phase was removed by centrifugation through Phase-lock Gel (Eppendorf). The cDNA was then in vitro transcribed in the presence of biotinylated UTP to give labelled cRNA using the Affymetrix IVT kit. The cRNA was purified using RNAeasy clean-up columns (Qiagen). To improve the recovery from the columns, the elution water was spun into the matrix at 27 g and then left to stand for one minute prior to the standard 8000 g centrifugation recommended by Qiagen. The cRNA was fragmented by heating in fragmentation buffer (40mM Tris-acetate pH8.1, 100mM KOAc, 30mM MgOAc) as recommended by Affymetrix. The Affymetrix eukaryotic hybridization controls were added to the sample prior to hybridization as per manufacturer’s instructions.","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0,"parameter":["Amount of nucleic acid labeled","Amplification","Label used"]}]}}
