Experiment Description	The triose-phosphate/phosphate translocator (TPT) of the chloroplast inner envelope membrane mediates the counter-exchange of stromal triose phosphates derived from CO2 fixation with cytosolic phosphate, thus providing the cytosol with precursors for sucrose synthesis. We have isolated an Arabidopsis mutant (tpt-1) in which the gene encoding TPT is disrupted by a T-DNA insertion. During growth in low light tpt-1 plants are phenotypically normal, but in high light photosynthesis is inhibited and growth is retarded relative to wildtype. This mutant compensates for the absence of TPT by diverting photosynthate into starch which is hydrolysed and exported from the chloroplast as glucose that is subsequently phosphorylated by hexokinase. In low light the capacity of the pathway of starch synthesis is sufficient to accommodate the normal rate of CO2 fixation, but in high light it is unable to match the potential rate of CO2 fixation. Consequently, in high light-grown plants there are measurable effects on the redoxstate of several components. Thus, the tpt-1 mutation influences the carbohydrate status within the cell, alters the form in which carbon is received by the cytosol, and changes the redox signals that are important in photosynthetic acclimation. Method: Plants will be grown in a 8h light:16h dark regime at both 400 and 100 Âµmol PAR m-2 s-1. Total RNA will be extracted from pools of individual illuminated leaves from at least eight plants at growth stage 3.70. Leaves will be harvested 2 h into the photoperiod to maximise differences between plant lines in the expression of genes of photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. We anticipate that expression of many genes will be affected by the absence of TPT and by changes in light intensity. However, by comparing differences in transcript levels between wildtype and TPT mutant grown in high light with the differences that occur in plants grown in low light we will discriminate between genes whose expression is affected by changes in the pattern of carbohydrate metabolism and those influenced by redox poise of the thylakoid photochemical components. These comparisons will also highlight genes affected by recently identified regulatory interactions between sugar-sensing and redox-sensing. A genome-wide expression study will establish the extent to which gene expression is altered by the absence of TPT in leaves, and will provide the basis for more detailed analysis of a selected range of transcripts whose levels of expression differ between plant lines.

Protocol Description													Protocol: Seedlings harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA extracted as described in the Qiagen RNAeasy kit. 	RNA samples were quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 100 pmol T7-(dT)24 primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3')  was hybridized with the Total RNA ( 8 - 12ug) at 70 Â°C for 10 minutes. First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM ÃÂ-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.
