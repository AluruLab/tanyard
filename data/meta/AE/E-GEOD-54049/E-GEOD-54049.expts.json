Our studies focused on the TF bZIP1 (BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER 1), a central integrator of cellular and metabolic signaling. To discern the mechanisms by which bZIP1 regulates a gene netowork in response to a nitrogen (N)-signal perceived in vivo, we perturbed both bZIP1 and the N-signal that it transduces in a cell-based transient expression system called TARGET (Transient Assay Reporting Genome-wide Effects of Transcription factors). To identify the genome-wide targets of bZIP1 in response to a N-signal, we transiently perturbed both the TF and the signal in the TARGET cell-based system.  Specifically, bZIP1 was transiently overexpressed in root protoplasts following transfection with a 35S::GR::bZIP1 construct containing an RFP (red fluorescent protein) selectable marker gene. bZIP1 transfected cells were sequentially treated with: i) an inorganic nitrogen signal (+\/-N), ii) cycloheximide (CHX) to block the synthesis of proteins, and iii) dexamethasone (DEX) to induce nuclear import of the GR::bZIP1 protein. To identify both the TF-regulated and the TF-bound genes, transcriptome analysis of transfected cells and micro-ChIP data (using anti-GR antibodies), were carried out in parallel .  This submission represents transcriptome component of study."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Nancy J Francoeur","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Tara M Moran","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Ying Li","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Christopher Hackley","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Molly B Edwards","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Gabriel Krouk","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Kranthi Varala","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"W R McCombie","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Amy Marshall-Colon","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Gloria M Coruzzi","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Ying Li","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Kenneth D Birnbaum","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Alessia Para","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Bastiaan O Bargmann","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":24958886,"authors":"Para A, Li Y, Marshall-Col√≥n A, Varala K, Francoeur NJ, Moran TM, Edwards MB, Hackley C, Bargmann BO, Birnbaum KD, McCombie WR, Krouk G, Coruzzi GM","title":"Hit-and-run transcriptional control by bZIP1 mediates rapid nutrient signaling in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1404657111"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["10 day"]},{"category":"cell type","value":["protoplast"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["pBeaconRFP_GR empty vector","pBeaconRFP_GR::bZIP1"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["empty vector","pBeaconRFP_GR::bZIP1"]},{"name":"treatment","value":["Treated with cycloheximide, 10 uM dexamethasone in ethanol, 20 mM KCl","Treated with cycloheximide, 10 uM dexamethasone in ethanol, 20 mM KNO3 and 20 mM NH4NO3 solution","Treated with cycloheximide, ethanol, 20 mM KCl","Treated with cycloheximide, ethanol, 20 mM KNO3 and 20 mM NH4NO3 solution","Treated with solvent, 10 uM dexamethasone in ethanol, 20 mM KCl","Treated with solvent, 10 uM dexamethasone in ethanol, 20 mM KNO3 and 20 mM NH4NO3 solution","Treated with solvent, ethanol, 20 mM KCl","Treated with solvent, ethanol, 20 mM KNO3 and 20 mM NH4NO3 solution"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":47,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1171526,"accession":"P-GSE54049-6"},{"id":1171525,"accession":"P-GSE54049-7"},{"id":1171529,"accession":"P-GSE54049-4"},{"id":1171527,"accession":"P-GSE54049-5"},{"id":1171528,"accession":"P-GSE54049-2"},{"id":1171524,"accession":"P-GSE54049-1"},{"id":1171530,"accession":"P-GSE54049-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":47,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":47,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":47,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":47,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":47,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":47,"isderived":0}]}]}}
