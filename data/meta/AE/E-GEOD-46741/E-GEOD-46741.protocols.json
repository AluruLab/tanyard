To estimate the concentration and quality of samples, NanoDrop 2000c (Thermo Scientific) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 NanoKit were employed, respectively. Libraries were prepared following the TruSeq™ RNA Sample Preparation Guide (Illumina). 3 µg of total RNA were polyA-purified, fragmented and first-strand cDNA synthesized by reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II-Invitrogen) and random hexamers. This was followed by RNA degradation and second strand cDNA synthesis. End repair process and adittion of a single ‘A’ nucleotide to the 3’ ends allowed ligation of multiple indexing adapters. Then, an enrichment step of 12 cycles of PCR was performed. Library validation included quality control and quantification.","type":"nucleic acid library construction protocol","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1010757,"accession":"P-GSE46741-5","name":"P-GSE46741-5","text":"1hr white light pulse during middle of the night (CT=6) or middle of the subjective day (CT=18).
