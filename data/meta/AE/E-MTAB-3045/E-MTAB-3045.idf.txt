Comment[Submitted Name]	Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of 35S::amiPPD line
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of first leaft pair of amiPPD mutant and wild type Arabidopsis plants		
Experiment Description	To obtain more insight into the molecular changes associated with PPD down-regulation, RNA was extracted from the first leaf pair of ami-ppd and wild-type plants at 13 DAS (the time point at which differences in leaf area start to be visible), and subjected to micro-array transcript profiling.
