All hydroponic media were aerated to maximize air supply during hydroponic culture. All plants were grown in basal MGRL hydroponic media for 20 days before being transferred to a phosphate-deficient medium. During the 10-day treatment, the phosphate-deficient medium was replaced every three days. For recovery experiments, plants previously grown in phosphate-deficient medium for 10 days were transferred to full-strength MGRL medium for an additional 3 days. Samples were collected on the 10th and 13th (10+3) day. Phosphate-starved shoot and root samples were collected separately at the indicated time point. Furthermore, all experiment procedures such as media replacement and sample collection were performed in the middle of day in order to minimize possible circadian effect. In parallel, control plants were grown in a full-strength MGRL media before sample collection on the 10th day after the initial 20-day growth period.","type":"specified_biomaterial_action","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1169386,"accession":"P-GSE33790-3","name":null,"text":"Non-sterile WT (Col-0) seeds were sowed on rock wool (Grodan Inc.) pre-soaked in basal MGRL hydroponic media24 and cold-treated at 4°C for 3 days.
