Comment[Submitted Name]	affy_syringae_malaga_athaliana-Role of different proteases in plant defence																																					
Experiment Description	affy_syringae_malaga_athaliana - affy_syringae_malaga_athaliana - - Pseudomonas syringae is a plant pathogenic bacterium that relies on a type III secretion system (T3SS) to cause disease in susceptible hosts and to trigger defence in resistant plants. The T3SS translocates effector proteins directly inside the plant cell. Some P. syringae pathovars translocate the effector HopZ1a, which is recognized in Arabidopsis, triggering the hypersensitive response (HR). This resistance does not depend on the usual defence pathways involved in resistance against other avirulence effectors, so it would be very helpful to know the transcriptomic events that take place in the context of a hypersensitive response triggered by HopZ1a. ULP genes codifies for plant SUMO-proteases. Recent studies by our group revealed that they could be involved in plant defense against microorganisms.-- We infiltrated Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia wild type with 10mM MgCl2 (as mock inoculation), the virulent pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto), Pto expressing the effector HopZ1a and Pto expressing a HopZ1a derivative carrying a point mutation in a residue essential for the cystein-protease activity. We also grew ulp1c/ulp1d mutant plants to analyze them either without treatment or inoculated with MgCl2 (as mock) and Pto wt.
