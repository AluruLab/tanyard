GSM545374 1	- Pseudomonas syringae is a plant pathogenic bacterium that relies on a type III secretion system (T3SS) to cause disease in susceptible hosts and to trigger defence in resistant plants. The T3SS translocates effector proteins directly inside the plant cell. Some P. syringae pathovars translocate the effector HopZ1a, which is recognized in Arabidopsis, triggering the hypersensitive response (HR). This resistance does not depend on the usual defence pathways involved in resistance against other avirulence effectors, so it would be very helpful to know the transcriptomic events that take place in the context of a hypersensitive response triggered by HopZ1a. ULP genes codifies for plant SUMO-proteases. Recent studies by our group revealed that they could be involved in plant defense against microorganisms.	ulpmock_2	Arabidopsis thaliana	rosette leaf	Col-0	ulp1c/ulp1d double mutant	  	P-GSE21920-18	P-GSE21920-12	P-GSE21920-24	GSM545374 extract 1	total RNA	P-GSE21920-5	GSM545374 LE 1	Biotin	P-GSE21920-6	GSM545374	A-AFFY-2	P-GSE21920-7	P-GSE21920-8	GSM545374.CEL	ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/data/experiment/GEOD/E-GEOD-21920/E-GEOD-21920.raw.1.zip	P-GSE21920-1	GSM545374_sample_table.txt norm	GSM545374_sample_table.txt	ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/data/experiment/GEOD/E-GEOD-21920/E-GEOD-21920.processed.1.zip	ulp1c/ulp1d double mutant	MgCl2

GSM545385 1	- Pseudomonas syringae is a plant pathogenic bacterium that relies on a type III secretion system (T3SS) to cause disease in susceptible hosts and to trigger defence in resistant plants. The T3SS translocates effector proteins directly inside the plant cell.
