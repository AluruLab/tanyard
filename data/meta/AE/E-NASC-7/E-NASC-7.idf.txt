Experiment Description	 The Arabidopsis mutant cir1 displayed constitutive expression of defence genes and enhanced resistance to the virulent pathogens Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) and Peronospora parasitica Noco2.  In order to dissect the downstream signalling components constitutively activated in cir1, cir1 plants were crossed to the ethylene-insensitive mutant ein2.  Resistance to Pst was abolished in cir1:ein2 plantswhile resistance to P. parasitica Noco2 was maintained.  Thus CIR1-mediated resistance to Pst appears to be dependent on ethylene signalling through EIN2but resistance to P. parasitica Noco2 is EIN2-independent. The aim of the proposed experiment is to identify EIN2 dependent and independent global gene expression in cir1 plants.  It is likely that expression of a sub-set of EIN2-dependent genes in cir1 are required for resistance to Pst whereas EIN2-independent genes may be required for P.parasitica Noco2 resistance.  Identification and analysis of genes in these sub-sets may reveal common regulatory mechanisms and may extend the understanding of resistance to Pst and P. parasitica Noco2 in Arabidopsis.  This information should be of interest to the Arabidopsis disease resistance community. Total RNA will be extracted from leaf tissue harvested from five-week old soil-grown plants.

Protocol Description	RNA samples were quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 100 pmol T7-(dT)24 primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3')  was hybridized with the Total RNA ( 8 - 12ug) at 70Â°C for 10 minutes. First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM -NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.   	Protocol:  Total RNA extracted using Trizol was purified using a Qiagen spin column, precipitated with 4M Lithium Chloride and ethanol and dried.
