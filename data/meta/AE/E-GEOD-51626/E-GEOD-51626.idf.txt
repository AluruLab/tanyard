Investigation Title	Role of NPR1 in SA mediated transcription						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Role of NPR1 in SA mediated transcription
Experiment Description	Affymetrix expression analysis was used to validate the role of NPR1 in SA mediated transcription. The RNA of col-0 and npr1-1 mutant were isolated after 24hr water and SA treatment.The ATH1 gene chip was used for expression analysis.

Protocol Description	affymetrix-algorithm-name = rma program-name = Expression Console ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA signal	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol using 250 ng total RNA.	According to affymatrix gene chip instruction manual using Fluidisc station 450.	After two weeks of growth, the medium was exchanged with either water or 2mM SA and 24h incubation was given in light at 22±2∫C.	Seed sterilization and plant growth conditions were followed as reported earlier (Hardtke and Deng, 2000) for both Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and npr1-1 mutant. All seeds were grown in vitro in MS medium by keeping them on a mesh at 4∞C for 2 days for stratification before placing them in the growth chamber. A. thaliana plants were grown under controlled environmental conditions (22±1∫C, 120 ÔÅ≠mol m-2 sec-1, 16h light/8h dark cycle).	Total RNA was isolated from complete seedlings using Sigma SpectrumÆ Plant total RNA kit (STRN 250)	GeneChips were scanned using Affymatrix gene chip scanner.
