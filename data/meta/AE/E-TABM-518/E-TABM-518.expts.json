While some key genes involved in pathways controlling disease resistance, and signaling intermediates such as salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), have been identified through mutational analyses, the use of genetic variation in natural populations permits the identification of change-of-function alleles, which likely act in a quantitative manner. Whole genome microarrays, such as Affymetrix GeneChips, allow for molecular characterization of the disease response at a genomics level and characterization of differences in gene expression due to natural variation. Differences in the level of gene expression, or expression level polymorphisms (ELPs), can be mapped in a segregating population to identify regulatory quantitative trait loci (expression QTLs, e-QTLs) affecting host resistance responses. We surveyed recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a population derived from a cross of inbred Arabidopsis accessions Bayreuth-0 (Bay-0) and Shahdara (Sha) in order to map e-QTLs controlling ELPs. We treated vegetatively grown plants with either SA or a control solution (Silwet), and harvested the plants 28 hours after chemical treatment. We present Affymetrix GeneChip microarray expression data for 2 biological replications of the SA-treated samples for 211 RILs, plus replicated Bay-0 and Sha control samples grown at the same time as the RILs. The control (Silwet-treated) samples were submitted as E-TABM-126. Normalized data is not provided here as the normalization step was included in the data statistical analsyses - for more information please contact the experiment
