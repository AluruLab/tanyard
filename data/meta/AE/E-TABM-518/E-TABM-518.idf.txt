Experiment Description	The study of natural genetic variation for plant disease resistance responses is a complementary approach to utilizing mutants to elucidate genetic pathways. While some key genes involved in pathways controlling disease resistance, and signaling intermediates such as salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), have been identified through mutational analyses, the use of genetic variation in natural populations permits the identification of change-of-function alleles, which likely act in a quantitative manner. Whole genome microarrays, such as Affymetrix GeneChips, allow for molecular characterization of the disease response at a genomics level and characterization of differences in gene expression due to natural variation. Differences in the level of gene expression, or expression level polymorphisms (ELPs), can be mapped in a segregating population to identify regulatory quantitative trait loci (expression QTLs, e-QTLs) affecting host resistance responses. We surveyed recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a population derived from a cross of inbred Arabidopsis accessions Bayreuth-0 (Bay-0) and Shahdara (Sha) in order to map e-QTLs controlling ELPs. We treated vegetatively grown plants with either SA or a control solution (Silwet), and harvested the plants 28 hours after chemical treatment. We present Affymetrix GeneChip microarray expression data for 2 biological replications of the SA-treated samples for 211 RILs, plus replicated Bay-0 and Sha control samples grown at the same time as the RILs. The control (Silwet-treated) samples were submitted as E-TABM-126. Normalized data is not provided here as the normalization step was included in the data statistical analsyses - for more information please contact the experiment provider.

Protocol Description	Seeds of  Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Bay-0; Sha; and Bay-0 x Sha RILs originally developed by O. Loudet (http://www.inra.fr/qtlat); were obtained from ABRC through TAIR (www.arabidopsis.org).   Due to limitations in growth chamber space;  two biologi	RNA was extracted from the bulked plants using TRIzol as per the manufacturers protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by purification on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).	cDNA and labeled cRNA were prepared according to the manufacturers guidelines in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual 701021 rev5 (Affymetrix; Santa Clara; CA; USA). The cDNA synthesis was initiated with 5 micrograms total RNA; one-cycle cDNA synthesis and cRNA labeling were performed with kits purchased from Affymetrix.	Title: Affymetrix EukGE-WS2v4_450 Hybridization. Description: 	The labeled cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips according to the manufacturers guidelines in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual 701021 rev5 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).  Wash protocol EukGE-WS2 v4_450 was used.		Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description:
