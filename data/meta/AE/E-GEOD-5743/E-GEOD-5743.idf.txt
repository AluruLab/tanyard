Experiment Description	This experiment was annotated by TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org). In this experiment we examined whole genome response to herbicidal levels of 2,4-D application. Arabidopsis plants (14 days) grown in vitro on MS medium in petri dishes were flooded with 1 mL stock of 2,4-D to enable root uptake. Plants were treated with 1.0 mM 2,4-D for a period of 1 hour immediately after which RNA was extracted and used for the microarray based experiments. the goal of this study was to explore the herbicidal mode of action of auxinic herbicide 2,4-D.
