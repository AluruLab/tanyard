Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = Signal ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M) DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Affymetrix standard protocol	Seedlings were grown for 10 days at 22 degrees.	MAS5.0	GeneChip Scanner 3000	Seedlings were treated with or without tunicamycin (5 mg/l) for 5 h in the presence of actinomycin D (75 micro molar). ActD was added 2 hours before tunicamycin or mock treatment. For mock, DMSO (solvent for tunicamycin) was added instead of tunicamycin.	Rneasy Plant Miini Kit (Quagen)	3' INV Express Kit
