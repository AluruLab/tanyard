Experiment Description	AtIPT8/pga22 seedlings (gain-of-function mutant in Ws background; Sun et al. 2003, Plant Physiology 131, pp167-176) were grown on vertical plates for 7 days in LD. The seedlings were then incubated directly on the plate with medium containing 5 uM 17-beta-estradiol (for induction of the IPT8 gene) or 5 uM trans-zeatin for 12 and 24 h. 5 mm primary root tips were harvested from the seedlings and pooled for microarray analysis. Total RNA was isolated from the samples with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit from Qiagen. 14 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	The seedlings were treated directly on the agar plates with liquid medium (control) or liquid medium containing 5uM 17-beta-estradiol or 5uM trans-zeatin for 12 and 24 h.	Labelled using protocol described in manual "Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual", One-Cycle target labelling	Biotin Labelled cRNA using "Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit", according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0-calculated signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call
