Seeds were treated with 70 % ethanol + 0.1 % Tween-20 for two minutes. They were then washed briefly with 95 % ethanol and dried.  Sterilised seeds were put in rows (20-25 seeds/row) on square (12 x 12 cm) agar plates. After stratification, the plates were put in vertical position under light (LD growth chamber) and kept for 7 days. The seedlings were then treated with liquid medium for 12 or 24 h directly on the plates, and root tips from the treated seedlings were harvested for RNA extraction.  1 Agar, nutrients and sucrose were mixed with water, and pH was adjusted to 5.7.

Seeds were treated with 70 % ethanol + 0.1 % Tween-20 for two minutes. They were then washed briefly with 95 % ethanol and dried.  Sterilised seeds were put in rows (20-25 seeds/row) on square (12 x 12 cm) agar plates. After stratification, the plates were put in vertical position under light (LD growth chamber) and kept for 7 days. The seedlings were then treated with liquid medium for 12 or 24 h directly on the plates, and root tips from the treated seedlings were harvested for RNA extraction.  1 Agar, nutrients and sucrose were mixed with water, and pH was adjusted to 5.7.
