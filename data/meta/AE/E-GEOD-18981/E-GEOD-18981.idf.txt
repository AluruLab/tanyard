Investigation Title	Analysis of RLI on RNA stability in A. thaliana						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Analysis of RLI on RNA stability in A. thaliana						
Experiment Description	A number of RNA encoding different functions have been detected in the plant vasculature. An RNase L inhibitor, similar to that present in humans have been identified in the phloem sap of cucurbits. We are interested in analyze the role of this putative inhibitor on the transcript levels that could be present in the vasculature and mainly in the phloem stream. For this purpose, we obtained an RLI T-DNA insertion mutant and generated A. thaliana overexpressing lines using the ORF of the two alleles found in the database.  Keywords: Expression profilling by array 6 samples were used in this experiment

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5 normalized signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = present, marginal, absent calls<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol	Seeds were sterilized, mixed with agarose 0.01% and dropped onto prewet sunshine mix soil. Trays were covered until plantelets appeared.	Labelled using protocol described in Affymetrix manual &quot;3' IVT Express Kit User Manual&quot;	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
