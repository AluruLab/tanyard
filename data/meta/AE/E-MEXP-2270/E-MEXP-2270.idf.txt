Protocol Description	Total RNA extraction using Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	above ground tissue of 10 day old seedlings was harvested and incubated in 0.5 MS + 0.1% DMSO + 5µM BA + 1µM IAA for 1 hour.	above ground tissue of 10 day old seedlings was harvested and incubated in 0.5 MS + 0.1% DMSO + 5µM BA for 1 hour.	above ground tissue of 10 day old seedlings was harvested and incubated in 0.5 MS + 0.1% DMSO for 1 hour.	above ground tissue of 10 day old seedlings was harvested and incubated in 0.5 MS + 0.1% DMSO + 1µM IAA for 1 hour.	Initial stratification for 2 days at 4 degrees<br><br>Plants were grown on soil under continuous light at 23°C<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, min temperature = 23, temperature unit = C, media = soil)	20 seedlings were co-treated and RNA was extracted from the pooled tissue.	according to manufacturer (Ambion)<br>(Parameters: Amount of nucleic acid labeled = 1, Mass unit = Micro gram, Amplification = RNA polymerases)	Title: Affymetrix EukGE-WS2v4_450 Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	Raw data (Affy .CEL files) were quantile normalized, background corrected and transformed into expression estimates by gcRMA implemented in R. All settings were standard and all files were included in a single transformation. NOTE: expression estimates generated by gcRMA are log2 (log base 2) !
