Investigation Title	HIRA regulate Arabidopsis dedifferentiation process						
Comment[Submitted Name]	HIRA regulate Arabidopsis dedifferentiation process
Experiment Description	Plant development is characterised by the capacity to reprogram differentiated cells to initiate asexual reproduction and to produce new organs such as lateral roots. To test whether HIRA could be involved in aspects of developmental reprogramming we studied the effect of HIRA during de-differentiation Arabidopsis root tissue was digested with enzyme to generate protoplast. This process would induce plant cell dedifferentiation. Experiments were performed in WT and hira background to understand how hira affect plant dedifferentiation process.
