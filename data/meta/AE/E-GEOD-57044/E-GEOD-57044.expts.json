To test whether HIRA could be involved in aspects of developmental reprogramming we studied the effect of HIRA during de-differentiation Arabidopsis root tissue was digested with enzyme to generate protoplast. This process would induce plant cell dedifferentiation. Experiments were performed in WT and hira background to understand how hira affect plant dedifferentiation process."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Frederic Berger","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Frederic Berger","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Sarah Holec","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Haifeng Wang","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jing Li","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Xin Nie","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"genome type","value":["hira","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["protoplast","root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOME TYPE","value":["hira","wild type"]},{"name":"ORGANISM PART","value":["protoplast","root"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":8,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1086335,"accession":"P-GSE57044-2"},{"id":1086334,"accession":"P-GSE57044-3"},{"id":1086333,"accession":"P-GSE57044-4"},{"id":1086332,"accession":"P-GSE57044-5"},{"id":1086331,"accession":"P-GSE57044-6"},{"id":1086330,"accession":"P-GSE57044-7"},{"id":1086329,"accession":"P-GSE57044-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0}]}]}}
