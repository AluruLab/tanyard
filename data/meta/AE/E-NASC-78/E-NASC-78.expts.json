To understand the molecular mechanisms of sugar responses, we isolated and characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, high sugar- response 8 (hsr8), which enhances sugar responsive growth and gene expression. Light- grown hsr8 plants exhibited increased starch and anthocyanin and reduced chlorophyll content in response to glucose treatment. Dark- grown hsr8 seedlings show glucose- hypersensitive hypocotyl elongation and development. The HSR8 gene, isolated using map-based cloning, is allelic to the MUR4 gene involved in arabinose synthesis. Dark- grown mur1 and mur3 seedlings also exhibit similar sugar responses to hsr8\/mur4. The sugar- hypersensitive phenotypes of hsr8\/mur4, mur1 and mur3 were restored to those of WT by boric acid, suggesting that alterations in the cell wall cause hypersensitive sugar- responsive phenotypes. Genetic analysis showed that sugar- hypersensitive responses in hsr8 mutants were suppressed by prl1, indicating that nuclear-localised PRL1 is required for enhanced sugar-responses in hsr8 mutant plants. Microarray analysis revealed that expression of many cell wall-related and sugar-responsive genes was altered in mur4-1, and expression of a significant proportion of these genes was restored to wild type levels in the mur4-1prl1 double mutant. These findings reveal a pathway that signals changes in the cell wall through PRL1 to altered gene expression and sugar- responsive metabolic, growth and developmental changes. The experiments submitted here are conducted on 6d-old seedlings grown on medium containning 1% glucose in dark."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Yunhai Li","role":"investigator submitter","email":"yunhai.li@bbsrc.ac.uk"},{"contact":"unknown NASCArrays","role":"curator","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":17693536,"authors":"Li, Yunhai; Smith, Caroline; Corke, Fiona; Zheng, Leiying; Merali, Zara; Ryden, Peter; Derbyshire, Paul; Waldron, Keith; Bevan, Michael W.","title":"Signaling from an Altered Cell Wall to the Nucleus Mediates Sugar-Responsive Growth and Development in  Arabidopsis thaliana","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.106.049965","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["6 days"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["  ","Columbia"]},{"category":"GeneticModification","value":["  ","gene_knock_out"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["mur4-1 knock-out","mur4-1prl1 knock-out","prl1 knock-out","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["mur4-1 knock-out","mur4-1prl1 knock-out","prl1 knock-out","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":8,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":90412,"accession":"NASC:LabellingProtocol"},{"id":413761,"accession":"P-TABM-NASC:419:1"},{"id":143,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4"},{"id":90416,"accession":"NASC:ExtractProtocol:3"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
