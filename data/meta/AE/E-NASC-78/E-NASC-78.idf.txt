Experiment Description	Sugars such as glucose function as signal molecules that regulate gene expression, growth and development in plants, animals and yeast. To understand the molecular mechanisms of sugar responses, we isolated and characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, high sugar- response 8 (hsr8), which enhances sugar responsive growth and gene expression. Light- grown hsr8 plants exhibited increased starch and anthocyanin and reduced chlorophyll content in response to glucose treatment. Dark- grown hsr8 seedlings show glucose- hypersensitive hypocotyl elongation and development. The HSR8 gene, isolated using map-based cloning, is allelic to the MUR4 gene involved in arabinose synthesis. Dark- grown mur1 and mur3 seedlings also exhibit similar sugar responses to hsr8/mur4. The sugar- hypersensitive phenotypes of hsr8/mur4, mur1 and mur3 were restored to those of WT by boric acid, suggesting that alterations in the cell wall cause hypersensitive sugar- responsive phenotypes. Genetic analysis showed that sugar- hypersensitive responses in hsr8 mutants were suppressed by prl1, indicating that nuclear-localised PRL1 is required for enhanced sugar-responses in hsr8 mutant plants. Microarray analysis revealed that expression of many cell wall-related and sugar-responsive genes was altered in mur4-1, and expression of a significant proportion of these genes was restored to wild type levels in the mur4-1prl1 double mutant. These findings reveal a pathway that signals changes in the cell wall through PRL1 to altered gene expression and sugar- responsive metabolic, growth and developmental changes. The experiments submitted here are conducted on 6d-old seedlings grown on medium containning 1% glucose in dark.

Protocol Description	Seeds were surface-sterilized with 100% isopropanol and 20% (v/v) household bleach, washed at least five times with sterile water, stratified at 4&deg;C for 6 d in the dark, dispersed on Murashige and Skoog medium (Duchefa Biochemie BV, Haarlem, The Netherlands) supplemented with 0.9% agar and 1% glucose, exposed to light for 18 hours, and then grown vertically in complete darkness at 23&deg;C.	Protocol: Seedlings harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA extracted as described in the Qiagen RNAeasy kit. 	RNA samples were quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 100 pmol T7-(dT)24 primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3')  was hybridized with the Total RNA ( 8 - 12ug) at 70 Â°C for 10 minutes. First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM ÃÂ-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.
