Experiment Description	"The oxt6 mutant is an oxidative stress-tolerant Arabidopsis mutant that is deficient in a polyadenylation factor subunit.  Expression analysis suggests that impaired poly(A) site choice is responsible for the stress-tolerant phenotype. We used microarrays to understand the link between the polyadenylation defect and stress tolerance. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis plants (the wild-type, oxt6 mutant, and two independent oxt6 transformants each carrying a gene encoding just the smaller of the two At1g30460-encoded proteins) were seeded and grown in soil.  Plants were harvested for RNA isolation after 30 days; for this, six samples derived from 10-15 plants were prepared for each line.  Ten samples were selected for study â three wild-type, three oxt6, and two from each of the complemented lines.  Analysis of independent complemented plants minimizes the possible effects that may arise due to T-DNA insertion."

Protocol Description	"Arabidopsis plants were seeded and grown in soil at 22-26 Â&deg;C in an 8 hr light/16 hr dark regime (under Phillips F40CW 34W fluorescent lights, with an intensity of 55 Â&#956;mol m-2 sec-1)."	"RNA was isolated using the Invitrogen Trizol Reagent (cat 15596-018) and further purified with the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (cat 74903), and tested for quality by gel electrophoresis and inspection of the stable RNA bands."	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 4 ug total RNA.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description:
