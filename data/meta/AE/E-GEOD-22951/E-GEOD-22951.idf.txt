Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcript profiling of three genotypes by ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation
Experiment Description	Due to ever increasing environmental deterioration it is likely that influx of solar UV-B radiation (280-320 nm) will increase further due to the depletion of stratospheric ozone. Given this fact it becomes essential that we better understand both rapid and adaptive responses of plants to UV-B imposed stress. Here we compare the transcriptmic responses of wild type Arabidopsis to that of Arabidopsis mutants impaired in flavonoid (TRANSPARENT TESTA4 [tt4] or sinapoyl-malate (sinapoylglucose accumulator 1 [sng1]) biosynthesis, to a short, 24h exposure to this photo-oxidative stress. In control experiments we subjected the same genotypes to 24h treatments of continuous light. Total 18 samples; number of biological replicates, n = 3 each; 2 different light treatments; three genotypes
