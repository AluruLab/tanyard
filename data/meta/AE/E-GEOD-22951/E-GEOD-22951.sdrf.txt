GSM566631 1	Arabidopsis mutants impaired in sinapoyl-malate (sinapoylglucose accumulator 1 [sng1]) biosynthesis in CO1 experiment, aerial region, 18-day-old sample grown on solid MS- medium containing 1% sucrose, a single plant was used in each hybridization. The sample was grown under highly controlled growth conditions, under two independent environmental regimes. The chosen conditions were; (i) growth for 17 days under typical long day conditions with 24 h ultraviolet light on day 18 (ultraviolet light 1; UV1)and (ii) growth for 17 days under typical long day conditions with 8 h additional light on day 18 (continuous light 1; CO1). Plants were cultivated in controlled growth chambers (SANYO; MLR-350) at 22°C in 16-h light and 8-h dark conditions for 17 days. The aerial region was harvested, 6 h after the onset of the bright phase under each light treatment.

The sample was grown under highly controlled growth conditions, under two independent environmental regimes. The chosen conditions were; (i) growth for 17 days under typical long day conditions with 24 h ultraviolet light on day 18 (ultraviolet light 1; UV1)and (ii) growth for 17 days under typical long day conditions with 8 h additional light on day 18 (continuous light 1; CO1).
