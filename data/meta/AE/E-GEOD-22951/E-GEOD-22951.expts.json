Given this fact it becomes essential that we better understand both rapid and adaptive responses of plants to UV-B imposed stress. Here we compare the transcriptmic responses of wild type Arabidopsis to that of Arabidopsis mutants impaired in flavonoid (TRANSPARENT TESTA4 [tt4] or sinapoyl-malate (sinapoylglucose accumulator 1 [sng1]) biosynthesis, to a short, 24h exposure to this photo-oxidative stress. In control experiments we subjected the same genotypes to 24h treatments of continuous light.
