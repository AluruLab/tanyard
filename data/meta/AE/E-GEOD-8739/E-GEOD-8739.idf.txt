Such genes are likely regulated by DELLA proteins which are master gibberellin repressors. DELLA proteins are rapidly degraded after gibberellin treatment, but their direct target genes still need to be elucidated. Experiment Overall Design: A set of 4 biological replicates was generated for each treament. Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with water or 2 uM GA4 and whole shoots collected after 1h. A comparison of water vs. GA4 treated samples should render a list of early gibberellin responsive genes."							Protocol Name	P-G8739-2	P-G8739-5	P-G8739-1	P-G8739-4	P-G8739-3	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown	P-AFFY-6	Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStatProtocol Type	specified_biomaterial_action	specified_biomaterial_action	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformationProtocol Description	Whole seedlings were sprayed with water with a fine mister and shoots were collected 1h after treatment by cutting with a razor blade.	Whole seedlings were sprayed with 2 uM GA4 with a fine mister and shoots were collected 1h after treatment by cutting with a razor blade.	Seeds were germinated on MS agar plates supplemented with 2% sucrose on a piece of nylon mesh as support. Seedlings were grown vertically for 8 days under continuous light at 22C.
