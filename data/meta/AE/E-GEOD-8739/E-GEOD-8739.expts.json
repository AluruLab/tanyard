Such genes are likely regulated by DELLA proteins which are master gibberellin repressors. DELLA proteins are rapidly degraded after gibberellin treatment, but their direct target genes still need to be elucidated. Experiment Overall Design: A set of 4 biological replicates was generated for each treament. Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with water or 2 uM GA4 and whole shoots collected after 1h. A comparison of water vs. GA4 treated samples should render a list of early gibberellin responsive genes."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Rodolfo Zentella","role":"submitter","email":"zentella@duke.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":17933900,"authors":"Rodolfo Zentella, Zhong-Lin Zhang, Mehea Park, Stephen G Thomas, Akira Endo, Kohji Murase, Christine M Fleet, Yusuke Jikumaru, Eiji Nambara, Yuji Kamiya, Tai-Ping Sun","title":"Global analysis of della direct targets in early gibberellin signaling in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.107.054999","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["8 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Landsberg erecta"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["ga1-3"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["shoot"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["GA4","water"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":8,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":1125613,"accession":"P-G8739-5"},{"id":1125614,"accession":"P-G8739-2"},{"id":1125612,"accession":"P-G8739-1"},{"id":1125611,"accession":"P-G8739-4"},{"id":1125610,"accession":"P-G8739-3"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
