Among 375 genes that showed differential expression (P-value <0.05) with >1.5-fold changes between wild type and cdm1, 185 genes were down-regulated by 1.5 to 7.10-folds, whereas 190 genes were up-regulated by 1.5 to 5.82-folds. Wild type and cdm1 young floral buds were used to isolate total RNA, with two biological replicates for each. Microarray analysis was performed using 500ng of total RNA per sample as described in the Genechip Expression Analysis Technical Manual."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Pingli Lu","role":"submitter","email":"pinglilu@fudan.edu.cn"},{"contact":"Hong Ma","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Pingli Lu","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":24567187,"authors":"Lu P, Chai M, Yang J, Ning G, Wang G, Ma H","title":"The Arabidopsis CALLOSE DEFECTIVE MICROSPORE1 Gene Is Required for Male Fertility through Regulating Callose Metabolism during Microsporogenesis.","doi":"10.1104\/pp.113.233387"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["Arabidopsis at day 24 after seed germination"]},{"category":"cultivar","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["cdm1 mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["Unopen flower buds"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["cdm1 mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":975313,"accession":"P-GSE55799-4"},{"id":975315,"accession":"P-GSE55799-3"},{"id":975314,"accession":"P-GSE55799-2"},{"id":975310,"accession":"P-GSE55799-1"},{"id":975311,"accession":"P-GSE55799-6"},{"id":975312,"accession":"P-GSE55799-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0}]}]}}
