Investigation Title	wt and opr3 control and systemic wounding											
Comment[Submitted Name]	wt and opr3 control and systemic wounding											
Experiment Description	wt plants (ws) and opr3 mutant plants were wounded  Half of the rosette leaves of 6 weeks old plants were wounded by clamping a tweezers across the midvein. RNA was extracted from control and systemic leaves 2 h after wounding, and was subject to affymetrix ATH1 chip. one repeat: wt control, wt systemic wounding, opr3 control, opr3 systemic wounding

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = after RMA normalization	Following fragmentation, 12 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45°C on GeneChip ATH1. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	6 weeks old plants	Plants were grown under white light in a 10-h-light/14-h-dark cycle (short day ) at 21°C.	RMA via the PARTEK software	GeneChips were scanned using Affymetrix GC3000 7G.	Wounding treatment	Half of the rosette leaves of six weeks old WT  plants were wounded by clamping a tweezers across the midvein. RNA was extracted from control  leaves 2 h after wounding, and was subject to affymetrix ATH1 chip.	control	Extraction of total RNA was performed using RNeasy plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacture's protocol.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix), in the Weizmann Institute microarray unit	Label protocol
