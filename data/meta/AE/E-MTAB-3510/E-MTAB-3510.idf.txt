Protocol Description	All Arabidopsis thaliana plants (ecotype Columbia-0) were grown in pots on a soil mixture (3:2:1 mixture of peat moss-enriched soil:vermiculite:perlite). Seeds were cold-treated for 3d at 4dgree in the dark before being transferred to a controlled growth room under long-day conditions (16-/8-h light/dark cycle) at 23 dgree and relative 50% humidity.	Total RNAs were isolated from Arabidopsis stems using a Rneasy plant mini kit (Qiagen no.74904) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.	Four-week-old Arabidopsis plants were incubated in a dark growth chamber with 0.1% oxygen (with 99.9% nitrogen) concentrations for 4 hours. Oxygen concentration in a dark growth chamber were regularly controlled to ensure p;recise regulation of the actual oxygen concentration around the aerial parts of Arabidopsis. Total RNAs were isolated from stems of four-week-old Arabidopsis.	Four-week-old Arabidopsis plants were incubated in a dark growth chamber with 21% oxygen concentrations for 4 hours. Oxygen concentration in a dark growth chamber were regularly controlled to ensure p;recise regulation of the actual oxygen concentration around the aerial parts of Arabidopsis. Total RNAs were isolated from stems of four-week-old Arabidopsis.	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown	Labeling of samples was carried out according to the manufacturerâ€™s standard protocol from Affymetrix.
