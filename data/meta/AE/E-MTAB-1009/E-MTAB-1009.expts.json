Arabidopsis seedlings and undifferentiated cultured Arabidopsis cells were launched in April, 2010, as part of the BRIC-16 flight experiment on STS-131. Biologically replicated DNA microarray and averaged RNA digital transcript profiling revealed several hundred genes in seedlings and cell cultures that were significantly affected by launch and spaceflight. The response was moderate in seedlings; only a few genes were induced by more than 7-fold, and the overall intrinsic expression level for most differentially expressed genes was low. In contrast, cell cultures displayed a more dramatic response, with dozens of genes showing this level of differential expression, a list comprised primarily of heat shock-related and stress-related genes. This baseline transcriptome profiling of seedlings and cultured cells confirms the fundamental hypothesis that survival of the spaceflight environment requires adaptive changes that are both governed and displayed by alterations in gene expression. The comparison of intact plants with cultures of undifferentiated cells confirms a second hypothesis: undifferentiated cells can detect spaceflight in the absence of specialized tissue or organized developmental structures known to detect gravity."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Agata K Zupanska","role":"submitter","email":"zupanska@ufl.edu"},{"contact":"Robert J Ferl","role":"investigator","email":"robferl@ufl.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":22221117,"authors":"Paul AL, Zupanska AK, Ostrow DT, Zhang Y, Sun Y, Li JL, Shanker S, Farmerie WG, Amalfitano CE, Ferl RJ","title":"Spaceflight transcriptomes: unique responses to a novel environment","doi":"10.1089\/ast.2011.0696","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["7 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["wild type"]},{"category":"growth condition","value":["Ground Control Orbiter Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center","NASA BRIC spaceflight hardware"]},{"category":"individual","value":["BRICA_PDFU-1_052","BRICA_PDFU-2_176","BRICA_PDFU-3_113","BRICA_PDFU-4_135","BRICA_PDFU-5_099","BRICB_PDFU-2_083","BRICB_PDFU-3_104","BRICB_PDFU-4_033","BRICB_PDFU-5_153","BRICG_PDFU-1_012","BRICG_PDFU-2_018","BRICG_PDFU-3_159","GORUND_BRICG_PDFU-1_335","GROUND_BRICA_PDFU-1_168","GROUND_BRICA_PDFU-2_315","GROUND_BRICA_PDFU-3_320","GROUND_BRICA_PDFU-4_314","GROUND_BRICA_PDFU-5_319","GROUND_BRICB_PDFU-2_312","GROUND_BRICB_PDFU-3_338","GROUND_BRICB_PDFU-4_331","GROUND_BRICB_PDFU-5_318","GROUND_BRICG_PDFU-2_355","GROUND_BRICG_PDFU-3_334"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["etiolated seedling","undifferentiated tissue culture"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["ground control","spaceflight environment"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["etiolated seedling","undifferentiated tissue culture"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":24,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1229624,"accession":"P-MTAB-25690"},{"id":1229623,"accession":"P-MTAB-25692"},{"id":1229625,"accession":"P-MTAB-25691"},{"id":1229622,"accession":"P-MTAB-25693"},{"id":1229626,"accession":"P-MTAB-25689"},{"id":1229627,"accession":"P-MTAB-25688"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":24,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":1,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":2,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":2,"isderived":0}]}]}}
