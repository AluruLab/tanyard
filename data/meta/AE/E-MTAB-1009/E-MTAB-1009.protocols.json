All of the sub-culturing on the plates was conducted in the laboratory of the PIs and the University of Florida.  Some planting of the seeded plates was conducted at KSC. Plates were planted in a laminar flow hood and stored in sterile Biotransfer Boxes (BT). Plates with both seeds and cells were kept in the dark, and the seeds vernalized at 4 deg C.Preparation of specialized plates and biology Petri plates: Because of their configuration within the BRIC flight hardware, sterility was maintained on all surfaces (interior and exterior) of the Petri plates. The media in the plates for BRIC had to be 5mm deep or less to accommodate the biology and the PDFU cover hardware. For a 60mm dish, this calculates out to 6.7 mLs. After pouring, the plates are allowed to solidify, and then transferred to a sterile Biotransporter (to maintain sterility of external surface) until planting. Preparation of seeded plates: Arabidopsis seed was surface sterilized working in a laminar flow hood. Seeds were planted on the surface of the Petri plates at a density of about 75 seeds per plate.  The cover was replaced, but not taped, and transferred to a sterile BT.  The BT was wrapped in black cloth and stored at 4 deg C until Turn Over. Preparation of cell culture plates:  The liquid media from a sterile cell suspension was decanted, and the cells were washed once with fresh liquid media, and then decanted again. A sterile scoop was used to place about 1 gram of cells in the surface on the plate and disperse evenly across the surface. The cover was replaced, but not taped, and transferred to a sterile BT.  The BT was wrapped in black cloth and stored at room temperature until Turn Over. BRIC Spaceflight Hardware: The hardware for this experiment was the NASA BRIC-LED (Biological Research In a Canister ï¾– Light Emitting Diode). The LED component of the hardware was disabled and all biology was held in the dark for the duration of the experiment. The BRIC-LED canisters hold six 60 mm diameter Petri plates in small sub-compartments called PDFUs (Petri Dish Fixation Units). The PDFUs allow an externally activated fixation step without manipulating the samples. We were allocated 13 PDFUs: 5 in BRIC A, 5 in BRIC B and 3 in BRIC G. The six replicate plates of seedlings and six replicate plates cultured cells (12 plates total) were distributed among three BRIC canisters. We were allocated 13 PDFUs: 5 in BRIC A, 5 in BRIC B and 3 in BRIC G. One of the PDFU slots in each BRIC was used to hold a HOBO data logger to record temperature. The HOBO temperature data collection begins immediately after the biology is sealed in the BRICs, 24 hours before launch. The BRICs were contained within a foam-lined tray for launch and stowage in a Shuttle Middeck Locker for the flight. An additional set of Petri plates within BRIC hardware, identical to that launched for Spaceflight, was prepared for the Ground Control. The Ground Control was housed in the OES (Orbital Environmental Simulator) chamber in the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The Ground Control was initiated with a precise 24 hour delay to enable the OES environment to be programmed with the environmental profile taken from telemetry of the Space Shuttle. Nominally, the Ground Control BRIC hardware and samples experienced the same external environment profile as the hardware and samples on the Space Shuttle. Environmental parameters that are controlled on the OES and made identical to flight are cabin temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration.  Flight profile and environmental conditions: The BRIC-16 experiment was turned over to payload engineers in the SLSL at KSC 24 hours before the scheduled launch time. The payload launched on STS-131 on April 5th, 2010, at 06:25, and achieved orbit approximately eight minutes later. The biology was in orbit 12 days and 21 hours (04\/05\/10 06:25:28 to 04\/18\/10 03:37:28) before being fixed on orbit with RNAlater. The orbiter landed on April 20th (04\/20\/10 07:37:28) and the biology was returned to the PIs at SLSL approximately 7 hours later.","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1229626,"accession":"P-MTAB-25689","name":null,"text":"Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN)","type":"nucleic_acid_extraction","performer":"Zupanska A.","hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null,"parameter":"RNA quality (RIN)"},{"id":1229624,"accession":"P-MTAB-25690","name":null,"text":"cDNA was synthesized using Ovation Pico WTA System (NuGEN Technologies Inc.)","type":"reverse_transcription","performer":"Zhang Y.","hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null,"parameter":"amount of RNA used"},{"id":1229625,"accession":"P-MTAB-25691","name":null,"text":"cDNA was labeled using Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies Inc.)","type":"labeling","performer":"Zhang Y.","hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null,"parameter":"amount of cDNA used"},{"id":1229623,"accession":"P-MTAB-25692","name":null,"text":"Amplified and labeled cDNA (5 ug\/sample) was fragmented and hybridized with rotation onto Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16h at 45C.
