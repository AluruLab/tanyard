Investigation Title	Gene expression of Arabidopsis leaves under heat stress and during recovery						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Gene expression of Arabidopsis leaves under heat stress and during recovery
Experiment Description	To understand plant adaptation to heat stress, gene expression profiles of Arabidopsis leaves under heat stress, during recovery and control condition were obtained using microarray. Microarray data listed responsible candidate genes for glycerolipid metabolism. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) seeds were surface-sterilised and sown on an agar-solidified Murashige and Skoog medium. Plants were grown at 22ÂºC under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle. Vegetative plants were subjected to high temperature for a day, then continued to be grown under normal condition for a day.
