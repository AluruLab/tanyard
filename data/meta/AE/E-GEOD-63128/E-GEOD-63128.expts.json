Microarray data listed responsible candidate genes for glycerolipid metabolism. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) seeds were surface-sterilised and sown on an agar-solidified Murashige and Skoog medium. Plants were grown at 22ÂºC under a 16-h-light\/8-h-dark cycle. Vegetative plants were subjected to high temperature for a day, then continued to be grown under normal condition for a day."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Fumiyoshi Myouga","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Kazuki Saito","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Yasuhiro Higashi","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Yozo Okazaki","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Kazuo Shinozaki","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Yasuhiro Higashi","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["18 days","19 days","20 days"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["wild-type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf"]},{"category":"sample group","value":["Control08hr","Control24hr","Heat08hr","Heat24hr","Recovery08hr","Recovery24hr"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"age","value":["18 days","19 days","20 days"]},{"name":"sample group","value":["Control08hr","Control24hr","Heat08hr","Heat24hr","Recovery08hr","Recovery24hr"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":27,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1136356,"accession":"P-GSE63128-3"},{"id":1136354,"accession":"P-GSE63128-2"},{"id":1136353,"accession":"P-GSE63128-5"},{"id":1136355,"accession":"P-GSE63128-4"},{"id":1136350,"accession":"P-GSE63128-1"},{"id":1136351,"accession":"P-GSE63128-7"},{"id":1136352,"accession":"P-GSE63128-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":27,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":27,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":27,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":27,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":27,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":27,"isderived":0}]}]}}
