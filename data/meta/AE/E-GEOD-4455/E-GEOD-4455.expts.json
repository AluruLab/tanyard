Despite the global nutritional significance of this fundamental metabolic process in nature, transcription factors regulating the plant sulfur assimilation pathways have never been discovered. We isolated sulfur limitation1 (slim1) mutants from Arabidopsis, showing abnormally low expression of SULTR1;2 sulfate transporter, by screening responsiveness of SULTR1;2 promoter-GFP, as an indicator, to sulfur limitation.  SLIM1 encoded an EIL-family transcription factor, EIL3. To clarify the siganificance of SLIM1 function in sulfur responsive gene expression, we analyzed the transcriptome profiles in slim1-1, slim1-2 and the parental line under +S and -S conditions. Experiment Overall Design: PSULTR1;2-GFP, slim1-1 and slim1-2 were vertically grown on the +S\/-S (S1500\/S15) agar medium. Root tissues of 10-day-old plants were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. All conditions were duplicated."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Akiko Maruyama-Nakashita","role":"submitter","email":"amaru@riken.jp"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":17114350,"authors":"Akiko Maruyama-Nakashita, Yumiko Nakamura, Takayuki Tohge, Kazuki Saito, Hideki Takahashi","title":"Arabidopsis SLIM1 is a central transcriptional regulator of plant sulfur response and metabolism.","issue":11,"pages":"3235-51","publication":"Plant Cell","volume":18,"year":2006}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":59403,"accession":"P-G4455-4"},{"id":59402,"accession":"P-G4455-5"},{"id":59400,"accession":"P-G4455-2"},{"id":59401,"accession":"P-G4455-3"},{"id":59404,"accession":"P-G4455-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
