Experiment Description	Plants utilize soil sulfate for production of sulfur-containing amino acids that serve as essential dietary sulfur sources for animals. Despite the global nutritional significance of this fundamental metabolic process in nature, transcription factors regulating the plant sulfur assimilation pathways have never been discovered. We isolated sulfur limitation1 (slim1) mutants from Arabidopsis, showing abnormally low expression of SULTR1;2 sulfate transporter, by screening responsiveness of SULTR1;2 promoter-GFP, as an indicator, to sulfur limitation.  SLIM1 encoded an EIL-family transcription factor, EIL3. To clarify the siganificance of SLIM1 function in sulfur responsive gene expression, we analyzed the transcriptome profiles in slim1-1, slim1-2 and the parental line under +S and -S conditions. Experiment Overall Design: PSULTR1;2-GFP, slim1-1 and slim1-2 were vertically grown on the +S/-S (S1500/S15) agar medium. Root tissues of 10-day-old plants were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. All conditions were duplicated.

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were grown at 22C under 16 h/8 h light and dark cycles for 10 days. Plants were grown on mineral nutrient media (Hirai et al. 1995 Plant Cell Physiology 36: 1331) containing 1% sucrose, 0.8% agar. For preparation of agar medium, agar was washed twice with 1 L of de-ionized water and vacuum filtrated. The agar medium with complete replacement of MgSO4 to MgCl2 contained approximately 10 Â&#956;M of residual sulfate derived from agar. The S1500 agar media were prepared by adding 1500 Â&#956;M of MgSO4.	Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were grown at 22C under 16 h/8 h light and dark cycles for 10 days.

The agar medium with complete replacement of MgSO4 to MgCl2 contained approximately 10 Â&#956;M of residual sulfate derived from agar. The S15 agar media were prepared by adding 15 Â&#956;M of MgSO4 and 1485 Â&#956;M of MgCl2.	Root samples were transferred to liquid nitrogen before RNA extraction.	Total RNA was prepared using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 microg total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
