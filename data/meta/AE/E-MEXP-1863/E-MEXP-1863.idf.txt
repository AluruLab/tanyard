Experiment Description	Ozone at an elevated level is an important environmental stress factor that limits plant growth and development. To test how O3-induced ROS signalling interacts with the ABA pathway we present a global characterization of O3-responsive genes in the abi1td mutant. To understand better ABA signalling and the interactions between stress-response pathways we also performed a microarray analysis of drought-treated abi1td and WT plants. Since ABA signalling is well known to mediate defined responses based on the WT and different mutants analysis in drought stress conditions, the comparison of the O3 and drought stress response in abi1td enabled the identification of new processes depending on ABA-related pathways in O3-treated plants. Altogether, our findings indicate that ABI1 plays the role of a general signal transducer linking diferrent hormone signalling pathways to O3 stress tolerance.<br><br><br><br>Key words: ROS signalling; ABA signalling; ozone stress; drought stress; environmental stress; gene knockout;

Protocol Description	Leaf tissues from were harvested directly into liquid nitrogen  then stored at -80oC until RNA extraction.	Total RNA was extracted in triplicate from five plants using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturers instructions. Then, 3 corresponding extractions were pooled and 15 µg of total RNA from the pooled samples was used for a single microarray hybridization experiment using ATH1 Genome Array (Affymetrix). cRNA synthesis, labelling, hybridization, and scanning were performed according to the standard Affymetrix protocol Synthesise cDNA with Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen, UK). Synthesise cRNA using the BioArray High Yield RNA transcript Labeling kit (Enzo Life Sciences Inc., NY) and apply to microarray. The experiment was performed using independent pools of plants i.e. biological replicates.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0 N1093; abi1td SALK_076309) were sterilized with bleach, chilled for 4 d, transferred to a growth chamber and grown on compost 3-5 plants per pot. Plants were watered daily; once a week plants were irrigated with mineral nutrient solution. Environmental conditions in the chamber included a 16-h photoperiod from 6.00 am to 10.00 pm, ~300 ?mol m-2 s-1 photon flux density, 75% relative humidity, the circulating air flow path and a temperature of 21 0C. O3 stress was performed by exposure of 4-week-old plants to 350 ppb of O3 dose from 9.00 am to 6.00 pm for 1 d. O3 was produced from O2 with an electrical discharge. O3 concentration was determined by an ASIN GDC31 O3 sensor (ASECO). Leaf tissues from WT and the abi1td mutant were harvested directly into liquid nitrogen after 3 and 6 h of O3 treatment. The control plants were maintained in O3-free conditions. Drought stress was applied to well watered 3-week-old plants by withholding water for 5 days until plant samples reached of 52,5±7,5% relative water content RWC: (fresh weightdry weight)/(turgid weightdry weight) x100. Control plants received water regularly. In each pot, leaves from one plant were harvested for RWC analysis. Control and stress-treated plant material were collected simultaneously to avoid any long-term differences in stress response.<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)	Total RNA was extracted in triplicate from five plants using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturers instructions. Then, 3 corresponding extractions were pooled (i.e. from 15 plants) and 15 µg of total RNA from the pooled samples was used for a single microarray hybridization experiment using ATH1 Genome Array (Affymetrix). cRNA synthesis, labelling, hybridization, and scanning were performed according to the standard Affymetrix protocol Synthesise cDNA with Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen, UK).
