To test how O3-induced ROS signalling interacts with the ABA pathway we present a global characterization of O3-responsive genes in the abi1td mutant. To understand better ABA signalling and the interactions between stress-response pathways we also performed a microarray analysis of drought-treated abi1td and WT plants. Since ABA signalling is well known to mediate defined responses based on the WT and different mutants analysis in drought stress conditions, the comparison of the O3 and drought stress response in abi1td enabled the identification of new processes depending on ABA-related pathways in O3-treated plants. Altogether, our findings indicate that ABI1 plays the role of a general signal transducer linking diferrent hormone signalling pathways to O3 stress tolerance.<br><\/br><br><\/br><br><\/br><br><\/br>Key words: ROS signalling; ABA signalling; ozone stress; drought stress; environmental stress; gene knockout;"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Leo Zeef","role":"submitter","email":"leo.zeef@man.ac.uk"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19705149,"authors":"Ludwikow A, Kierzek D, Gallois P, Zeef L, Sadowski J","title":"Gene expression profiling of ozone-treated Arabidopsis abi1td insertional mutant: protein phosphatase 2C ABI1 modulates biosynthesis ratio of ABA and ethylene","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"genotype","value":["abi1td","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"environmental stress","value":["control","drought","ozone"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["abi1td","wild type"]},{"name":"time","value":["0 hour","3 hour","6 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":19,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1165817,"accession":"P-MTAB-2067"},{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":1165818,"accession":"P-MTAB-2068"},{"id":1165820,"accession":"P-MTAB-2069"},{"id":1165816,"accession":"P-MTAB-2071"},{"id":1165819,"accession":"P-MTAB-2070"},{"id":77,"accession":"P-AFFY-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":19,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":19,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":19,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":19,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
