Experiment Description	"CHL1 is one of major nitrate transporters responsible for nitrate uptake and some studies suggest that it may be also play a role in regulating the nitrate response, its influence was analyzed in a global transcriptome study using Affymetrix ATH1 array. Experiment Overall Design: Three biological replicates of 10-day-old Arabidopsis root tissue from wild-type and chl1-5 plants were performed to explore differences  in gene expression between the wild-type and chl1-5 mutants exposed to 25 mM nitrate for 0h (T0) or 0.5h (T0.5) using Affymetrix ATH1 microarray."

Protocol Description	"Approximately 100 sterilized seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and chl1-5 plants (Columbia ecotype) were grown in different areas on the same mesh in a Magenta vessel (Sigma) in 60 mL of NO3--free liquid growth medium (10 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 pH 5.5, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM FeSO4-EDTA, 1 mM CaCl2, 50 Î¼M H3BO3, 12 Î¼M MnSO4â¢H2O, 1 Î¼M ZnCl2, 1 Î¼M CuSO4â¢5H2O, 0.2 Î¼M Na2MoO4â¢2H2O, 1 g/L MES, 0.5% sucrose) containing 12.5 mM (NH4)2 succinate as the sole nitrogen source, pH 6.5.  For each biological replicate, 9 vessels ( ~ 900 seedlings / each replicate) of samples were pooled to use in a single independent experiment.  Plants were grown under continuous illumination at 24-26Â&deg;C and rotated at 100 rpm."	"10-day-old plants were shifted to 60 mL of the same 12.5 mM (NH4)2 succinate medium in which the pH had been changed to 5.5 by addition of HCl.  After 3 h treatment, the plants were washed twice with 10 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 5.5, then 1) collected the root sample (T0), or 2) shifted for 0.5 hour (T0.5) to 60 mL of the same pH 5.5 growth medium, but with the 12.5 mM (NH4)2 succinate replaced by 25 mM KNO3, and the root sample was collected after 30 min induction."	"Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technology, Grand Island, NY, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by chloroform extraction and isopropanol / EtOH precipitation.  The total RNA was further purified using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA)"	"Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix)."
