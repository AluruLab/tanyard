A factorial experiment was conducted with two biological replicates of the two accessions.  For each biological replicate, multiple plants (~50) per accession were grown in a growth chamber under short day conditions (8 hr light at 100-120 microEinsteins, 20 degrees C day\/20 degrees C night) to maintain plants in the vegetative phase for six weeks.  The growth chambers used a combination of metal halide, mercury vapor, and incandescent lamps.  Plants were watered with half-strength Hoagland's solution.  SA and\/or Silwet treatment: Six-week-old plants were sprayed with 0.30 mM SA (salicylic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)  in 0.02% Silwet L77 to run-off, and control plants were sprayed with 0.02% Silwet L77, a surfactant (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX, USA), alone.  Vegetative leaves from plants from each combination of accession and treatment were harvested at 4, 28, and 52 hours post-treatment, and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extractions. Three plants per accession were bulked for each treatment\/time point combination. Each plant was harvested only once. To avoid diurnal variation in gene expression, the time points were 24 hrs apart and harvesting was always performed over a 30 minute period at the same time of day (1:00 PM).  ONLY THE SA TREATED SAMPLES ARE INCLUDED IN THIS SUBMISSION; THE SW TREATED (CONTROL) SAMPLES WERE SUBMITTED PREVIOUSLY (E-TABM-61).","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":92315,"accession":"P-TABM-hans16","name":"P-TABM-hans16","text":"cDNA and labeled cRNA were prepared according to the manufacturer’s guidelines in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual 701021 rev1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).  cDNA synthesis was performed with enzymes purchased from Invitrogen, and biotin labeling was conducted using an ENZO IVT labeling kit as per the GeneChip manufacturer's protocols.","type":"nucleic acid labeling protocol","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0}]}}
