Plants were transformed with the vector pMDC7DUO1, allowing induction of DUO1 by treatment with estradiol. T2 seedlings were selected on agar plates containing hygromycin for 12 days before seedlings were transferred to plates containing either 2 ÂµM 17beta-estradiol (induced), or control plates containing DMSO (non-induced). Plants were grown for 6, 12 or 24 hours before harvesting. RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy kit from Qiagen. Each sample consists of 20 seedlings combined and all treatments have been conducted in triplicate. 18 samples were used in this experiment."}],"provider":[{"contact":" Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC)","role":"submitter","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"},{"contact":"Lynette Brownfield","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["Boyes key 1.04"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["pMDC7DUO1"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["DMSO","estradiol"]},{"name":"dose","value":["2 micromolar"]},{"name":"treatment time","value":["12 hour","24 hour","6 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1128232,"accession":"P-GSE19266-7"},{"id":1128233,"accession":"P-GSE19266-6"},{"id":1128236,"accession":"P-GSE19266-3"},{"id":1128237,"accession":"P-GSE19266-2"},{"id":1128234,"accession":"P-GSE19266-5"},{"id":1128235,"accession":"P-GSE19266-4"},{"id":1128231,"accession":"P-GSE19266-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0}]}]}}
