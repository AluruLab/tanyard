Investigation Title	DUO1 ectopic expression						
Comment[Submitted Name]	DUO1 ectopic expression						
Experiment Description	The experiment is designed to examine changes in gene expression upon ectopic expression of the germ line transcription factor DUO1 in Arabidopsis. Plants were transformed with the vector pMDC7DUO1, allowing induction of DUO1 by treatment with estradiol. T2 seedlings were selected on agar plates containing hygromycin for 12 days before seedlings were transferred to plates containing either 2 ÂµM 17beta-estradiol (induced), or control plates containing DMSO (non-induced). Plants were grown for 6, 12 or 24 hours before harvesting. RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy kit from Qiagen. Each sample consists of 20 seedlings combined and all treatments have been conducted in triplicate. 18 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	Seeds were sterilized by washing for 5 min with 70% (w/v) ethanol/0.05% (w/v) triton-X 100 and then 10 min with 100% ethanol. Approximately 200 dry seeds were then spread on a 14cm Petri dish containing 1 X Murashige and Skoog basal salts, 0.8% phytagar and 20 ug/ml hyromycin with no carbon source. Plates were placed at 4C for 3 days then plants grown under constant light at 22C for 12 days before treatment began.	Labelled using protocol described in manual &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual&quot;, One-Cycle target labelling	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
