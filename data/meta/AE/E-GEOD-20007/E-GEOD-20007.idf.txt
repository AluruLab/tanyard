Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Log (base 2) of ratio between Agilent-reported normalised signal values for sample (mean_sig in supplementary file) and 2xX2x reference sample (cmean_sig in supplementary file)	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity and detection p-value<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Labelled cRNA was hybridised according to manufacturer’s protocols (done at NASC: http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/)	For each experimental cross (interploidy or fis1X2x), one array was hybridised using a Cy3-labelled sample together with a Cy5-labelled 2xX2x control cross sample using Agilent standard operating protocols. Then the dyes were swapped and the hybridisation was repeated with additional arrays.	Plants were grown at 18hr day cycles at 60% humidity. Male sterile lines were pollinated by the appropriate pollen depending on the cross and siliques harvested in liquid nitrogen at 5 days after pollination (DAP).	Plants were grown at 18hr day cycles at 60% humidity. Male sterile lines were pollinated by the appropriate pollen depending on the cross, and siliques harvested in liquid nitrogen at 5 days after pollination (DAP). For the msi1 sample, the msi1 mutation was introgressed in a A9 barnase male sterile line, siliques were left to elongate in absence of fertilization and were harvested 7 days after flower opening.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100.	Quantitation, background correction and normalisation was performed for each array separately and independently using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (Apr 2002). Probes with negative signal values were excluded, creating missing values. Values for multiply spotted probes were averaged.  For the fis1X2xCy3 and fis1X2xCy5 samples, probes with negative signal values and individual signal values for multiply spotted probes are included in the supplementary data files.	Agilent standard operating protocol.	Standard manufacturer's protocol (done at NASC: http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/)	none	mRNA was extracted from whole siliques using the hot borate method for total RNA extraction and the Oligotex mRNA Midi Kit (Qiagen) to isolate poly-A+ mRNA.	Total RNA from siliques was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and concentrated using an RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen).	Biotin labelling of cRNA using Affymetrix Enzo Kit according to manufacturer’s protocols (done at NASC: http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/)	Cy3- and Cy5-labelling were carried out using Agilent standard operating protocols.
