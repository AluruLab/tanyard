So far, details of the transcriptional mechanism of ROS-responsive genes are still largely unknown. In the study reported herein, we identified eight potential ROS-responsive cis-acting elements (ROSEs) from the promoters of genes upregulated by ROS. We also found that the APETALA2 (AP2\/EREBP)-type transcription factor ERF6 could bind specifically to the ROSE7\/GCC box. Co-expression of ERF6 enhanced luciferase activity driven by ROSE7. ERF6 interacted physically with mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MPK6), and also served as a substrate of MPK6. MPK6-mediated ERF6 phosphorylation at both Ser 266 and Ser 269 affected the dynamic alternation of ERF6 protein, which resulted in changes in ROS-responsive gene transcription. These data might provide new insight into the mechanisms that regulate ROS-responsive gene transcription via a complex of MPK6, ERF6, and the ROSE7\/GCC box. To identifiy the ERF6 regualted genes under ROS and HL treatment. Three-week old Col-0 and erf6-1 mutant plants before and after exposed to 2000 umol m-2s-1 illumination for 2 h were used for RNA extracted hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Song Chun-Peng","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Chun-Peng Song","role":"submitter","email":"songcp@henu.edu.cn"},{"contact":"Du Yanyan","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Wang Pengcheng","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"genetic background","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["erf6-1","wild type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["young seedling"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["erf6-1","wild type"]},{"name":"TREATMENT","value":["2000 umol m-2s-1 illumination for 2 h","control"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":543302,"accession":"P-GSE37818-4"},{"id":543301,"accession":"P-GSE37818-3"},{"id":543305,"accession":"P-GSE37818-2"},{"id":543299,"accession":"P-GSE37818-1"},{"id":543306,"accession":"P-GSE37818-8"},{"id":543303,"accession":"P-GSE37818-7"},{"id":543304,"accession":"P-GSE37818-6"},{"id":543300,"accession":"P-GSE37818-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0}]}]}}
