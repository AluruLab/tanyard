We call this the priming effect. Since the plant defense response is a systematic process involving numerous pathways and genes,to characterize the priming process, a time course study using a genome-wide microarray may provide more accurate information about the priming process. Furthermore, to what extent do the priming process and direct defense share similar gene expression profiles or pathways are also not clear. We used microarray to detect the priming effect of plant volatiles to healthy Arabidopsis thaliana, and the effect of direct leafminer feeding to Arabidopsis thalianas. A system using Lima bean plants, from which HIPVs can be effectively induced by leafminer feeding, as emitters and Arabidopsis thaliana as receivers is used to track the priming process between neighbor plants. The Arabisopsis thaliana seedlings were treated by volatiles from leafminer fed lima bean for 24h or 48h for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. The Arabisopsis thaliana seedlings fed by leafminer directly were also collected The for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix micorarrays. We want to explore the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to priming volatiles during a 24h-48h time course. We also want to compare the effect of priming and direct leafminer feeding."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Le Kang","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jianing We","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Sufang Zhang","role":"submitter","email":"wavingsnow@ustc.edu"},{"contact":"Sufang Zhang","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":22558246,"authors":"Zhang S, Wei J, Kang L","title":"Transcriptional analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana response to lima bean volatiles.","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0035867"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["4-week old"]},{"category":"genotype\/ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaves"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":16,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":857802,"accession":"P-GSE33505-7"},{"id":857803,"accession":"P-GSE33505-6"},{"id":857805,"accession":"P-GSE33505-3"},{"id":857807,"accession":"P-GSE33505-2"},{"id":857804,"accession":"P-GSE33505-5"},{"id":857806,"accession":"P-GSE33505-4"},{"id":857801,"accession":"P-GSE33505-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0}]}]}}
