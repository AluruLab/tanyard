Investigation Title	Transcript profiling of Arabidopsis albino msh1 mutants						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcript profiling of Arabidopsis albino msh1 mutants						
Experiment Description	The soybean msh1 RNAi transgenic line show various growth phenotype. We use microarray analysis to characterize gene expression pattern for two of the phenotypes - variegation and stunted growth. Wild type and Arabidopsis msh1 mutant albino tissues were collected for RNA extration and hybridization on Affymetrix.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Bioconductor RMA normalized value	According to Affymetrix instructions	RNA was hybridized to individual Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide ATH1 array using manufacturers instructions	total RNA was extracted from each plant using TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction procedure followed by purification on RNeasy columns (Qiagen).	plants were grown on MS media with 1.5% supplement of sucrose in percival growth chamber with 12h-light/12-dark period at 24ºC.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol	Expression data from Affymetrix Genechips were normalized using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method using Bioconductor’s affy package in the R language
