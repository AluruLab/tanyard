Experiment Description	Effect of lipocalin gene knock-out on gene expression and stress tolerance under normal growth temperature and under low temperature exposure

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis seeds were sown directly on potting medium, stratified for 3 days at 4&deg;C and grown for 11 days at 20&deg;C under long day conditions (16 hr light/8 hr dark) at a photon flux density of 90 &#956;mol m-2 sec-1. Seedlings were then transferred to 3.5 inches or 1.5 inches pots containing potting medium and grown under the same conditions as described above.	Wild type Col O Arabidopsis plants (named G1 on array) and lipocalin KO plants in Col O background (named G2 on array) were grown at normal temperature as described under growth conditions (temperature T1). For low temperature treament, 3 week-old plants (Col O or KO plants) were transferred to 4&deg;C for 7 days under short day conditions (8 hr photoperiod and a photon flux density of 90 &#956;mol m-2 sec-1) (temperature T2). Four treatment conditions are used for RNA extraction and array hybridization: G1T1, G1T2, G2T1 and G2T2. For each treatment, three biological replicates were prepared (A, B and C).	RNA was isolated using from whole plants using Trizol reagent as recommended by the manufacturer.	The Affymetrix in vitro transcription protocol was followed.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	The different hybridization were normalized using RMA Express (version 0.2) providing a single file for all hybridizations.
