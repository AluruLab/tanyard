Investigation Title	Analysis of Ripening-related Gene Expression in Papaya using an Arabidopsis-based Microarray									
Comment[Submitted Name]	Analysis of Ripening-related Gene Expression in Papaya using an Arabidopsis-based Microarray
Experiment Description	Background: Papaya (Carica papaya L.) is a commercially important crop that produces climacteric fruits with a soft and sweet pulp that contain a wide range of health promoting phytochemicals. Despite its importance, little is known about transcriptional modifications during fruit ripening and its control. In this study we report the analysis of ripe papaya transcriptome by using a cross-species (XSpecies) microarray technique based on the phylogenetic proximity between papaya and Arabidopsis thaliana.  Results: Papaya transcriptome analyses resulted in the identification of 414 ripening-related genes and some of them had their expression validated by qPCR. The transcription profile was then compared with that from ripening tomato and grape. Overall, the transcriptomics analysis revealed many similarities between ripening in papaya and tomato especially with respect to primary metabolism, regulation of transcription, biotic and abiotic stress and cell wall metabolism. XSpecies microarray data indicate that transcription factors (TFs) of the MADS-box, NAC and AP2/ERF gene families are involved in the control of papaya ripening and reveal that cell wall-related gene expression in papaya showed similarities to the expression profiles seen in A. thaliana during hypocotyl development.  Conclusion: The cross-species array experiment was successful in identifying ripening-related genes in papaya. The data indicated common and diverse elements of transcription control between fruit bearing taxa and has also indicated a possible distinct co-evolutionary mechanism for papaya cell wall disassembling system. The present study represents new topics for future researches that would help complement the structural genomic data provided by the papaya genome, since there is no gene-chip available for this plant organism. Papaya ripe transcriptome was analysed using mRNA extracted from unripe and ripe fruit from 2 replicates. After microarray hybridization in ATH1-121501 chip, data were normalized against data generated by papaya DNA hybridization in another ATH1-121501 chip and analysed using perl algorithms (masks).

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA normalized	GeneChipÆ arrays were scanned on an Affymetrix G2500A GeneArray scanner and cell intensity files (.cel file) were generated using Microarray Analysis Suite (MAS Version 5.0; Affymetrix).	Genomic DNA was hybridized with ATH1-121501 for 16 hours at 45 ∞C using standard hybridization protocols (Affymetrix©) and analyzed by computed scanning. Using a perl script available at http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/xpecies and a range of user-defined threshold values (from 0 to 500), computer files (CDF) were created with papaya genomic DNA hybridization data (mask files). Probe-pairs were retained for analysis if their signal values were greater than the defined threshold. Probe-sets were retained if they contained more than one probe-pair. Purified cRNA (15 Œºg) were heat-fragmented and hybridized to ATH1-121501 for 16 hours at 45 ∞C. The complete protocol has already been published (Hammond et al., 2005) and it is available at http://www.plantmethods.com/content/1/1/10.	Genomic DNA and total RNA extraction protocols were the same as previously described (Fabi et al., 2009b). Total RNA was purified using the ‚ÄúRNeasyÆ Kit‚Äù (Qiagen). Nucleic acids were quantified in the NanoDropÆ ND-1000 (Nanodrop Technologies©) and gel analyzed to verify their integrity (Sambrook et al., 2000). Total RNA were also analyzed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser‚Äù (Agilent Technologies©) to confirm its integrity before each hybridization.	Papaya fruit (Carica papaya L. cv. ‚ÄòGolden‚Äô) were harvested at colour break to º yellow (around 150 days after anthesis). One replicate of each unripe and ripe fruit samples for microarray assay was obtained from a previous study in 2007 (Fabi et al., 2007). The other two replicates of unripe and ripe samples for microarray and also for quantitative PCR analyses were obtained in 2010. Soon after harvest, the initial respiration and ethylene levels were determined (Fabi et al., 2007). Each experimental sample (unripe papaya and successive time points during the ripening process) comprised 12 individual fruits. After removal of the peel and seeds, the sliced pulp of each fruit was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80∞C.	Genomic DNA was labelled with the Bioprime DNA labelling System kit (Invitrogen‚Ñ¢). Total RNA (5 Œºg) from papaya pulp was reverse-transcribed to generate first strand cDNA containing a 5'-T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized using standard protocol, and the resulting samples were in-vitro transcribed by T7 DNA polymerase using biotinylated nucleotides to generate complementary RNAs (cRNAs).	CEL files were loaded into GeneSpring version 7.2 (Agilent Technologies) software using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) pre-normalization algorithm. The computer files that were being loaded in GeneSpring were filtered using the CDF files generated using the genomic DNA hybridization. For each replicate array, each probe-set signal value from ripe samples was compared to the probe-set signal value of unripe samples to give gene expression ratios. Differentially expressed genes were identified using one-way ANOVA with a Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate multiple testing correction.
