However, it remains largely unclear how genes with mitotic functions are transcriptionally regulated during organogenesis in plants. Here, we showed that a group of R1R2R3-Myb transcription factors are responsible for developmentally controlled downregulation of variety of mitotic genes in Arabidopsis. Loss of their functions resulted in elevated expression of mitotic genes in quiescent cells including those underwent terminal differentiation. Concomitantly, their mutations enhanced cell division activities in various aspects of plant development, generating organs with increased sizes and irregular architectures. In addition, we showed that this type of R1R2R3-Myb proteins are required for oscillated expression of G2\/M-specfiic genes, most likely by inhibiting transcription outside of G2\/M in the cell cycle. Our finding uncovered a novel plant-specific mechanism in which scheduled expression of G2\/M-specific genes may require their global repression both in the cell cycle and during development. Seedlings (9d-old) or leaves (5d or 15d-old) of the wild type or myb3r mutants were sampled for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Kosuke Kobayashi","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Taku Demura","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Misato Ohtani","role":"submitter","email":"misato@psc.riken.jp"},{"contact":"Masaki Ito","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Misato Ohtani","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":26069325,"authors":"Kobayashi K, Suzuki T, Iwata E, Nakamichi N, Suzuki T, Chen P, Ohtani M, Ishida T, Hosoya H, Muller S, Leviczky T, Pettko-Szandtner A, Darula Z, Iwamoto A, Nomoto M, Tada Y, Higashiyama T, Demura T, Doonan JH, Hauser MT, Sugimoto K, Umeda M, Magyar Z, Bogre L, Ito M","title":"Transcriptional repression by MYB3R proteins regulates plant organ growth","doi":"10.15252\/embj.201490899"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["15 day","5 day","9 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia ecotype"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["myb3r1 mutant","myb3r1 myb3r3 myb3r4 myb3r5 quadruple mutant","myb3r1 myb3r3 myb3r5 triple mutant","myb3r1 myb3r4 double mutant","myb3r3 mutant","myb3r3 myb3r4 myb3r5 triple mutant","myb3r3 myb3r5 double mutant","myb3r4 mutant","myb3r5 mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf","whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"age","value":["15 day","5 day","9 day"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["myb3r1 mutant","myb3r1 myb3r3 myb3r4 myb3r5 quadruple mutant","myb3r1 myb3r3 myb3r5 triple mutant","myb3r1 myb3r4 double mutant","myb3r3 mutant","myb3r3 myb3r4 myb3r5 triple mutant","myb3r3 myb3r5 double mutant","myb3r4 mutant","myb3r5 mutant","wild type"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["leaf","whole organism"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":20,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1167951,"accession":"P-GSE52298-2"},{"id":1167950,"accession":"P-GSE52298-3"},{"id":1167945,"accession":"P-GSE52298-1"},{"id":1167948,"accession":"P-GSE52298-5"},{"id":1167949,"accession":"P-GSE52298-4"},{"id":1167946,"accession":"P-GSE52298-7"},{"id":1167947,"accession":"P-GSE52298-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":20,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":20,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":20,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":20,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":20,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":20,"isderived":0}]}]}}
