Investigation Title	Expression data from WT, MPK6 Overexpression, and mpk6 T-DNA knockout Arabidopsis root and shoot under hypoxic and mock conditions							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from WT, MPK6 Overexpression, and mpk6 T-DNA knockout Arabidopsis root and shoot under hypoxic and mock conditions							
Experiment Description	MPK6 shows transient increase in activity under hypoxia with maximal activity at 2 hrs.  To study the role of MPK6 in hypoxia in Arabidopsis, 10 do seedlings of WT, mpk6 and MPK6 plants were exposed to 2 hrs hypoxia and 2hr air (mock). Because there are no major phenotypic differences between the genotypes, microarray was used to determine if there were transcript level differences between the genotypes. Wild type Col-0, MPK6 overexpression and mpk6 knockout mutants were exposed to 2 hr hypoxia and air and separated into root and shoot in order to determine the role of MPK6 in hypoxia in both root and shoot.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA value	cRNA were hybridized onto ATH1 genechip according to the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual R.5 (affymetrix)	Col-0 seedling were grown on 0.5x MS, 1% sucrose, 0.4% phytagel plates grown vertically for 10 days under long day conditions (16 hr light 8 hr darkness)	The data were analyzed with the Bioconductor package in R using RMA.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Workstation	Seedlings were placed into an airtight lucite chamber flooded with 99.998% argon for 2 hrs for hypoxia treatment.  Normoxic treatment required placing seedlings into an open lucite box for 2 hrs (mock).	Seedlings were disected into root and shoot tissue and frozen in liquid nitrogen.  RNA were extracted using RNeasy plant mini kit (Quiagen).	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the 2-cycle synthesis and labeling kit (Affymetrix)
