Investigation Title	Expression data from Arabidopsis Col-0 expressing FLAG-SUB1A or FLAG-SUB1C rice ERFs							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis Col-0 expressing FLAG-SUB1A or FLAG-SUB1C rice ERFs							
Experiment Description	In rice (Oryza sativa L.), the haplotype at the multigenic SUBMERGENCE 1 (SUB1) locus determines survival of prolonged submergence. SUB1 encodes two or three group VII Ethylene Response Factor (ERF) family transcription factors, SUB1A, SUB1B and SUB1C. A highly submergence-inducible SUB1A allele is present in lines that are submergence tolerant. This gene is the determinant of submergence tolerance. Here, the heterologous ectopic expression of rice SUB1A and SUB1C in Arabidopsis thaliana was employed to assess the transcriptional network mobilized by ectopic expression of SUB1A and SUB1C. Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants were stably transformed with constructs allowing the expression of 35S:FLAG-SUB1A and 35S:FLAG-SUB1C. Affymetrix ATH1 arrays were hybridized with RNA isolated from 7-day-old whole seedlings at midday (growth chamber, 0.5X MS-agar plates, 1 %(w/v) sucrose, 23 ºC, 16 h light/ 8 h dark, 125 uE m-2 s-1). Two biological replicates each.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA-normalized expression value	Hybridization to ATH1 GeneChips was performed following the manufacturer’s method (Affymetrix) at the Genomics Core Facility, University of California, Riverside.	Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized and stratified in water for 3 d at 4 ºC, germinated on 1X Murashige Skoog (MS) agar medium (0.43% [w/v] MS salts, pH 5.75) additionally containing 1% (w/v) sucrose in vertically oriented plates in a growth chamber (23 ºC, 16 h light/ 8 h dark, 125 uE m-2 s-1), and after 7 d of growth they were collected at midday, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80C until further processing.	Data was analyzed from CEL files using Robin (RMA model) (Lohse et al., 2010 [PMID 20388663]).	Arrays were scanned using the ScanArray Express (Perkin-Elmer).	No treatment was applied.	Total RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by further purification on RNeasy columns (Qiagen). RNA integrity was assessed by electrophoresis with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent).	Intact RNA (100 ng) was labeled using the GeneChip 3' IVT Express kit.
