Investigation Title	DEK1 calpain overexpression					
Comment[Submitted Name]	DEK1 calpain overexpression					
Experiment Description	Aim: To understand the role of DEK1 in Arabidopsis development. Background: DEK1 has an essential role during embryogenesis and is involved in the maintenance of the epidermis. Tissues: Comparison of wild-type and ADEK1 calpain-overexpressing line. 9 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	"ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call"	"Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA."	"Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA"	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	"Labelled using protocol described in manual &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual&quot;, One-Cycle target labelling"	"Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system"
