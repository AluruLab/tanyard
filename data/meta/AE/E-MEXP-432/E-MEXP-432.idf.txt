Experiment Description	Inducible overexpression of Arabidopsis meristem regulators by AlcR / AlcA system. Plants harboring 35S::AlcR/AlcA::GOI (GUS control, LEAFY, SHOOTMERSTEMLESS, WUSCHEL)constructs were grown in continous light for 12 days and induced with 1% Ethanol. After 12h of EtOH treatment, seedlings were dissected and RNA was processed from the shoot apex and young leaves. Affymetrix Ath1 arrays were hybridized in duplicates from each experiment.

Protocol Description	plants were watered with 1% EtOH and covered with dome for 12h	plants were watered and covered with dome for 12h	plants were grown on soil at 20Â° C in continuous light	Total RNA extraction using Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit	Tissue of 20 dissected apices was pooled for RNA extraction	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	raw data (Affy .CEL files) were quantile normalized, background corrected and transformed into expression estimates by gcRMA implemented in R. All settings were standard and all files were included in a single transformation. In the resulting text output file the Affy identifiers were mapped to AGI codes using the TIGR 4.0 release. NOTE: expression estimates generated by gcRMA are log2 (log base 2) !
