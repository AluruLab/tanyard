NMD has been studied in a number of organisms including humans, yeast, Drosophila, C. elegans and recently Arabidopsis. Recently the NMD process has been shown to have a wider significance in regulating the levels of mRNA expression for a wide range of genes in yeast and Drosophila. Several genes have been found to be required for NMD in a variety of organisms, including UPF1 and UPF3. We have identified and characterised a number of alleles of UPF1 and UPF3 in Arabidopsis that are defective in NMD. By doing a transcriptomic analysis of two NMD mutants, upf1-1 and upf3-1, and wild type plants we aim to identify the subset of genes that are co-regulated by UPF1 and UPF3 and, therefore, by NMD in Arabidopsis. RNA will be extracted from 17-day-old mutant and wild type seedlings grown at 22-24 C under constant light. 7 samples were used in this experiment."}],"provider":[{"contact":" Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC)","role":"submitter","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"},{"contact":"Luis Arciga-Reyes","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["17 days"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["upf1 mutation","upf3 mutation","wildtype"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"stock code","value":["N525175","N612922"]},{"category":"tissue","value":["whole plant"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["upf1 mutation","upf3 mutation","wildtype"]},{"name":"STOCK CODE","value":["N525175","N612922","not specified"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":7,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":106823,"accession":"P-GSE19253-1"},{"id":106824,"accession":"P-GSE19253-2"},{"id":106826,"accession":"P-GSE19253-3"},{"id":106828,"accession":"P-GSE19253-4"},{"id":106825,"accession":"P-GSE19253-5"},{"id":106827,"accession":"P-GSE19253-6"},{"id":106831,"accession":"P-GSE19253-7"},{"id":106830,"accession":"P-GSE19253-8"},{"id":106829,"accession":"P-GSE19253-9"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":7,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":7,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":7,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":7,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":7,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":7,"isderived":0}]}]}}
