Protocol Name	P-MTAB-23174	P-MTAB-23175	P-MTAB-23176
Protocol Description	4 days seedling of DEX:SNRK3.15 transgenic plant transfered to the 30uM DEX or 0.1% DMSO control plate for 24 hours. These DEX treated seedling (5 days seedling) transfered to the 2uM ABA or 0.11% DMSO with 30uM DEX. Control plants transfered to 2uM ABA or 0.11% DMSO without DEX plate.	"Seeds were sterilized by 70% Ethanol 3 minutes with vigorous shaking then rinsed once with Ethanol. After air drying, the seeds were plated on 0.5X MS 0.8% agar media. Following 3 days of stratification, plates were transferred to growth chamber and incubated under constant light for 4 days.<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C, media = 1/2MS)"	"6-day-old seedlings were ground into powder in liquid nitrogen, then total RNA was extracted by standard phenol/SDS method. <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = genomic_DNA, Amplification = none)"
