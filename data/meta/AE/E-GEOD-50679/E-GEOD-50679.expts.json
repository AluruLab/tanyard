Two independent transgenic lines of OE-HRA1 were considered as biological replicates (OE-HRA1#1 and OE-HRA1#2). Seven-day-old seedlings were treated either with or without hypoxia (low oxygen) stress for 2 hours. This dataset includes CEL files, RMA signal values and MAS5 P\/M\/A calls from total mRNA populations. Quantitative profiling of cellular mRNAs was accomplished with the Affymetrix ATH1 platform. 8 samples, 2 genotypes (Col-0 and OE-HRA1), 2 conditions (2 h non-stress and 2 h hypoxia stress), 2 independent biological replicate experiments"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Julia Bailey-Serres","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Seung Cho Lee","role":"submitter","email":"slee064@ucr.edu"},{"contact":"Seung Cho Lee","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["HRA1 overexpression","wild-type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["7-day-old seedlings"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["HRA1 overexpression","wild-type"]},{"name":"TREATMENT","value":["2 h hypoxia stress (2HS)","2 h non-stress (2NS)"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":8,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1052384,"accession":"P-GSE50679-7"},{"id":1052385,"accession":"P-GSE50679-6"},{"id":1052386,"accession":"P-GSE50679-5"},{"id":1052387,"accession":"P-GSE50679-4"},{"id":1052388,"accession":"P-GSE50679-3"},{"id":1052389,"accession":"P-GSE50679-2"},{"id":1052383,"accession":"P-GSE50679-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0}]}]}}
