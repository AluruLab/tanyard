Comment[Submitted Name]	Fine-tuning of the anaerobic response in plants relies on trihelix protein repression of the oxygen sensing machinery
Experiment Description	This study analyzes transcriptomic data of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and overexpression lines of Hypoxia Response Attenuator (HRA1; At3g10040) with Col-0 background (OE-HRA1). Two independent transgenic lines of OE-HRA1 were considered as biological replicates (OE-HRA1#1 and OE-HRA1#2). Seven-day-old seedlings were treated either with or without hypoxia (low oxygen) stress for 2 hours. This dataset includes CEL files, RMA signal values and MAS5 P/M/A calls from total mRNA populations. Quantitative profiling of cellular mRNAs was accomplished with the Affymetrix ATH1 platform. 8 samples, 2 genotypes (Col-0 and OE-HRA1), 2 conditions (2 h non-stress and 2 h hypoxia stress), 2 independent biological replicate experiments

Protocol Description	CEL files from the Affymetrix Chips were processed by use of the R program (http://cran.at.r-project.org/) and Bioconductor packages (http://www.bioconductor.org/). The Robust Multi-chip Average (RMA) normalization was performed using the default settings of the corresponding R function. Present, Marginal or Absent (P/M/A) calls were computed with the affy MAS5.0 package . ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 normalized ABS_CALL = 	biotin	Hybridization of 12 Î¼g of biotin-labeled cRNA to each Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array (GeneChip System®, Affymetrix) chips were performed at 45 °C for 16 h, in the Affymetrix GeneChip Workstation (hybridization oven 640, Fluidics Station 450), using 10 µg of Biotin-labeled aRNA, according to the manufacturer's protocol.	Plates with 7-d-old seedlings were transferred to Lucite chambers where they were deprived of air by displacement for argon gas (99.9%) for 2 hours. The hypoxic stress (2HS) treatment was applied under dim light (5 to 7 Î¼mol photons m-2 s-1) at the end of light cycle. For non-stress (2NS) treatment, MS plates were placed for 2 hours in the Lucite chambers that were open to ambient air.	Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized, stratified for 3 days at 4 °C and grown on solid MS media [0.43 % (w/v) Murashigi Skoog (MS) salts (Sigma)], 0.4 % (w/v) Phytagel (Sigma), 1 % (w/v) sucrose, pH 5.7) in a vertical orientation in a growth chamber (Model # CU36L5, Percival Scientific, Perry, IA) under a long day cycle (16 h light at ~80 Î¼mol photons m-2 s-1 and 8 h darkness) at 23°C for 7 days before treatments.	Total RNA was extracted from frozen pulverized plant tissues using QIAGEN RNeasy Plant Mini kit according to the manufacture's protocol. RNase-Free DNase treatment was conducted during the column purification process.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.
