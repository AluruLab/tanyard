Comment[ArrayExpressAccession]	E-GEOD-22947							Public Release Date	2010-12-31							Investigation Title	Expression data from in-vitro induced Interfascicular Cambium of Arabidopsis thaliana							Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from in-vitro induced Interfascicular Cambium of Arabidopsis thaliana							Experiment Description	In-vitro induced establishment and activity of the interfascicular cambium in Arabidopsis thaliana stems under auxin treatments. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the establishment and activity of the interfascicular cambium and identified tissue-speciffic up-regulated genes during this process. Different tissue types from in-vitro auxin treated stems were selected at successive stages of cambium establishment using laser capture microdissection for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We aimed to obtain genes exclussively upregulated in the interfascicular region responsible for cambium establishment and activity.							Date of Experiment								Term Source Name	EFO							Term Source Version								Term Source File	http://bar.ebi.ac.uk:8080/trac/browser/branches/curator/ExperimentalFactorOntology/ExFactorInOWL/currentrelease/eforelease/efo.owl							Person Last Name	Agusti	Greb						Person First Name	Javier	Thomas						Person Mid Initials								Person Email	javier.agusti@gmi.oeaw.ac.at							Person Affiliation	Gregor Mendel Institute							Person Phone	+43-(0)1-79044-9871							Person Fax								Person Address	"Gregor Mendel Institute, Dr. Bohr-Gasse 3, Wien, Austria"							Person Roles	submitter							Protocol Name	P-GSE22947-1	P-GSE22947-6	P-GSE22947-3	P-GSE22947-8	P-GSE22947-7	P-GSE22947-2	P-GSE22947-4	P-GSE22947-5Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA signal intensity	"Following fragmentation, the aRNAs were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip ATH1 array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400."	Plants were grown for 3 weeks on short days (8 hours light 16 hours dark) under standard conditions and then switched to lond days (16 hours light 8 hours dark)	The data were analyzed with the RMA method using limma and affy libraries in the Bioconductor statiscal package (R2.9.0).	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.	"Stem fragments of 1.5 cm in length located 2.5 cm apically from the base were excised with a scalpel and transferred to MS split-plates considering the original apical to basal orientation. After 2 or 5 days incubation, the central area (3 mm) of these samples, which had no direct contact with the media, was collected for snap-frozen embeding in OCT.Transversal 5 µm sections were cut with a cryostat and mounted in slides that were used to capture the appropriate tissue utilizing Laser Capture Microdissection."	"Total RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer´s instructions.Two RNA amplification rounds were performed using the TargetAmp™ 2-Round Aminoallyl-aRNA Amplification Kit (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions."	"Biotinylated aRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix)."Protocol Software								Protocol Hardware								Protocol Contact								Protocol Type	bioassay_data_transformation	hybridization	grow	feature_extraction	image_aquisition	specified_biomaterial_action	nucleic_acid_extraction	labelingProtocol Term Source REF								Protocol Term Accession Number								Experimental Factor Name	organism part	growth condition	treatment time					Experimental Factor Type	organism part	growth condition	time					Experimental Factor Term Source REF								Experimental Factor Term Accession Number								Comment[SecondaryAccession]	GSE22947							Comment[GEOLastUpdateDate]	2010-12-31							Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis stem tissues after treatment with naphthaleneacetic acid							Comment[AEExperimentType]	transcription profiling by array							Comment[GEOReleaseDate]	2010-12-31							Comment[ArrayExpressSubmissionDate]	2010-07-14							SDRF File	E-GEOD-22947.sdrf.txt
