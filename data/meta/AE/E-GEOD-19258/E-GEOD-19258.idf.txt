Investigation Title	Temperature-controlled inhibition of phyB action						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Temperature-controlled inhibition of phyB action						
Experiment Description	"It has been established that the frequently reported early flowering phenotype of the phyB mutant is very sensitive to small changes in ambient temperature (Halliday et al., 2003). A 6oC drop in temperature to 16oC is sufficient to abolish the pronounced early flowering phyB phenotype observed at 22oC. Using Affymetrix technology we will identify genes that are differentially regulated at 16oC and 22oC in a phyB-specific manner using phyB mutant and wild type seedlings. 16 samples were used in this experiment."

Protocol Description	"ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call"	"Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA."	"Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA"	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	"Seedlings were grown on soil at 16C for 11 days, then transferred to 22C for 21 days."	"Labelled using protocol described in manual &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual&quot;, One-Cycle target labelling"	"Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system"
