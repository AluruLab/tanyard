SPY also has a role in root development. In the spy mutant, a middle cortex is produced prematurely. To understand how SPY regulates root cortex proliferation, we sought to identify the genes affected by the spy mutation in the root. The transciptomes from the root of one-week-old seedlings, Col or spy-3 mutant, were compared. The seedlings were grown on a nylon membrane placed on 1X MS agar medium and the plates are positionally vertically in a Pecival growth chamber with 16 hr light and 8 hr dark. Three biological replicates were performed."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Hongchang Cui","role":"submitter","email":"hcui@bio.fsu.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":25267734,"authors":"Cui H, Kong D, Wei P, Hao Y, Torii KU, Lee JS4, Li J","title":"SPINDLY, ERECTA, and its ligand STOMAGEN have a role in redox-mediated cortex proliferation in the Arabidopsis root","doi":"10.1093\/mp\/ssu106"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["7 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia ecotype"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["spy-3 mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["spy-3 mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1167901,"accession":"P-GSE50952-4"},{"id":1167900,"accession":"P-GSE50952-3"},{"id":1167899,"accession":"P-GSE50952-2"},{"id":1167895,"accession":"P-GSE50952-1"},{"id":1167896,"accession":"P-GSE50952-7"},{"id":1167897,"accession":"P-GSE50952-6"},{"id":1167898,"accession":"P-GSE50952-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
