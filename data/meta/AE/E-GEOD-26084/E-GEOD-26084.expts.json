We posited that under certain environmental conditions these changes leads to maladaptations and favor emergence of new infectious diseases, and these adaptations will have characteristic signatures representative of the adaptation. Here using Arabidopsis seedlings in a submerged environment treated with P. aerugionsa, we show one such rewired regulation where the master two-component regulator GacA (previously shown to act upstream of quorum sensing, including the regulator LasR, that in turn controls a subset of virulence factors) is completely dispensable. The gacA mutant behaves similar to wild type P. aeruginosa (strain PA14) by a number of read-outs. Consistent with that, the gene expression data here indicates that the transcriptome pattern of the host is identical when treated with wild type PA14 or PA14-gacA mutant. Single time point (10 day old Arabidopsis seedlings infected with wild type PA14 or mutant bacteria PA14DgacA, and analyzed 24h after infection) with two independent experimenal replicates per treatment"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Suresh Gopalan","role":"submitter","email":"gopalan@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu"},{"contact":"Suresh Gopalan","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Frederick M Ausubel","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"cultivar","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"infection","value":["P. aeruginosa PA14","P. aeruginosa PA14DgacA"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedling"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"INFECTION","value":["P. aeruginosa PA14","P. aeruginosa PA14DgacA"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":522601,"accession":"P-GSE26084-2"},{"id":522607,"accession":"P-GSE26084-3"},{"id":522600,"accession":"P-GSE26084-1"},{"id":522604,"accession":"P-GSE26084-6"},{"id":522602,"accession":"P-GSE26084-7"},{"id":522606,"accession":"P-GSE26084-4"},{"id":522605,"accession":"P-GSE26084-5"},{"id":522603,"accession":"P-GSE26084-8"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0}]}]}}
