For each library, 1-5 μg of genomic DNA was sheared using a Covaris S220 Adaptive Focused Acoustics ultra sonicator. Libraries were constructed following standard protocol using the NEB Next DNA Sample Prep Master Mix Set 1 (NEB E6040) and Illumina-compatible paired-end adaptors, which had all cytosines, methylated. 50 ng of each library was treated with sodium bisulphite using EZ DNA Methylation-GoldTM Kit (Zymo Research D5005) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. For each purified library 5-10 ng of purified library was amplified using Expand High Fidelity PLUS PCR system (Roche 03300242001), which is capable of efficiently amplifying uracil-containing templates. 50 μl reactions contained 200 μM each dNTP, 1 μM primer, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 2.5 U Expand HiFi enzyme, and were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions for 18 cycles. Amplified libraries were ran on 2% MetaPhor® agarose (Lonza 50108) gel. Fragments of 220-350 bp were excised from gel and purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen 28104). DNA concentrations were quantified on Bioanalyzer (Agilent), diluted to 10 nM and loaded on flow cells to generate clusters.","type":"nucleic acid library construction protocol","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":976602,"accession":"P-GSE52952-12","name":"P-GSE52952-12","text":"No treatment.","type":"sample treatment protocol","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":976598,"accession":"P-GSE52952-13","name":"P-GSE52952-13","text":"Total RNA was isolated from pooled inflorescence tissue (n = 3) and TRIzol (Invitrogen).
