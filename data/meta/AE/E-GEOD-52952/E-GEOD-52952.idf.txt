Protocol Description	RMA normalized data in the Sample data tables. Further processed data were derived from GeneSpring. 20 percentile to filter for low intensity and high saturated probes. P-value cut-off 0.05. Fold change cut-off log2. ID_REF =  VALUE = Log2 RMA-signal	Biotynlated aRNA were prepared according to the standard ATH1 affymetrix protocol for 6 ug total RNA.	Hybridized for 16 hours at 45oC on GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome Array	Inflorescence tissue isolated on dry ice.	No treatment.	DNA was isolated from pooled inflorescence tissue (n = 3) collected phenol/chloroform extraction. For each library, 1-5 Î¼g of genomic DNA was sheared using a Covaris S220 Adaptive Focused Acoustics ultra sonicator. Libraries were constructed following standard protocol using the NEB Next DNA Sample Prep Master Mix Set 1 (NEB E6040) and Illumina-compatible paired-end adaptors, which had all cytosines, methylated. 50 ng of each library was treated with sodium bisulphite using EZ DNA Methylation-GoldTM Kit (Zymo Research D5005) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. For each purified library 5-10 ng of purified library was amplified using Expand High Fidelity PLUS PCR system (Roche 03300242001), which is capable of efficiently amplifying uracil-containing templates. 50 Î¼l reactions contained 200 Î¼M each dNTP, 1 Î¼M primer, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 2.5 U Expand HiFi enzyme, and were performed according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for 18 cycles. Amplified libraries were ran on 2% MetaPhor® agarose (Lonza 50108) gel. Fragments of 220-350 bp were excised from gel and purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen 28104). DNA concentrations were quantified on Bioanalyzer (Agilent), diluted to 10 nM and loaded on flow cells to generate clusters.	Total RNA was isolated from pooled inflorescence tissue (n = 3) and TRIzol (Invitrogen). Small RNA libraries were constructed using Illumina Tru-Seq Small RNA preparation kit. NEBNext multiplex small RNA libraries	Total RNA was isolated from pooled inflorescence tissue (n = 3) and TRIzol (Invitrogen).	Mix-stage inflorescence (contain majority of unopened flower buds) were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted by Tri reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. PARE: Degradome libraries (PARE) libraries were constructed as previously described (Zhai et al. 2013 PMID: 23810899). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute (Newark, DE).	Arabidopsis grown under standard long day growth conditions.	Plants were grown under standard long day growth conditions.	Arabidopsis grown on soil under standard long day growth conditions.	GeneChip scanned with the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.
