Protocol Description	"Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA quality was assessed by Agilent 2100 bioanalyser using the RNA 6000 Nano Chip (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands), and quantity was determined by ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., DE, USA).(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = PCR)"	Equal amounts of RNA from triplicate samples were pooled.	"Arabidopsis thaliana was grown on germination agar plates containing 0.5x Murashige-Skoog (MS) media with vitamins, 1.5% sucrose, 2.5 mM Mes, pH 5.7, and 0.8% agar at 23C with a 16-h photoperiod for 11 days(Parameters: time unit = hours, temperature unit = C, media = 1/2 MS media)"	"Arabidopsis thaliana was grown on germination agar plates containing 0.5x Murashige-Skoog (MS) media with vitamins, 1.5% sucrose, 2.5 mM Mes, pH 5.7, and 0.8% agar at 23C with a 16-h photoperiod for 11 days. For cold treatment, the light-grown seedlings were incubated at 1C for 2 h with white fluorescent light. (Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C, media = 1/2 MS media)"	"Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
