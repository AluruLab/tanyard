From the same plants, metabolites and enzyme activities were measured as well. Interestingly a gradual change could be observed over a wide range of temperatures. Some of which could be attributed to the CBF program. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes from 4 week old plants at a time point four hours into the light-period were transfered to various \"chilling\" temperatures (20 [control], 17, 14, 12, 10 and 8°C] and harvested after 6 or 78 hours (both 10 hours into the light period).
