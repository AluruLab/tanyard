Experiment Description	To investigate the response of Arabidopsis thaliana plants to non-freezing, cool temperatures, we subjected four week old plants to various chilling temperatures at defined times during the diurnal cycle to control for diurnal effects on transcription. From the same plants, metabolites and enzyme activities were measured as well. Interestingly a gradual change could be observed over a wide range of temperatures. Some of which could be attributed to the CBF program. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes from 4 week old plants at a time point four hours into the light-period were transfered to various "chilling" temperatures (20 [control], 17, 14, 12, 10 and 8Â°C] and harvested after 6 or 78 hours (both 10 hours into the light period). Experiment Overall Design: 6 continuous treatments X 2 timepoints X 2 replicates

Protocol Description	Plants were harvested in the vegetative state with 3 rosettes per sample, and typically at least 5 replicate samples. Rosettes were transferred into liquid nitrogen 10h into the light period	Arabidopis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was grown on soil in a 12h light/12h dark cycle,at a light intensity of 130umol*m-2 s-1 and at a constant temperature of 20Â&deg;C. At the age of 4 weeks plants were moved to 8C 4 hours into the light period.	Arabidopis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was grown on soil in a 12h light/12h dark cycle,at a light intensity of 130umol*m-2 s-1 and at a constant temperature of 20Â&deg;C. At the age of 4 weeks plants were moved to 14C 4 hours into the light period.
