We identified several candidate genes whose expression is significantly altered in lines with mesophyll tissue-specific BVR expression (Cab3::pBVR2), compared to constitutive phytochrome inactivation lines, i.e. 35S-driven BVR lines (35S::pBVR3). No-0 is used as wild-type (WT) Seeds of No-0 WT, 35S::pBVR3 and CAB3::pBVR2 on MS plates were exposed to Red (R) light of 75 µmol m-2 s-1 for 5 min and imbibing seeds were cold-stratified at 4 °C in darkness for 3 d. Seedlings were grown under continuous far-red illumination for 7 d. Seven-day-old vegetative whole seedlings (300 – 500 mg) were quickly (<1 min) harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen inside the FR chamber. Seedlings were grown under continuous far-red illumination for 7 d."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Sookyung Oh","role":"submitter","email":"ohsookyu@msu.edu"},{"contact":"Sookyung Oh","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Beronda Montgomery","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Sankalpi Warnasooriya","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"genetic modification","value":["35S::pBVR3","Cab3::pBVR2","No-0 wild-type (WT)"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENETIC MODIFICATION","value":["35S::pBVR3","Cab3::pBVR2","No-0 wild-type (WT)"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":731087,"accession":"P-GSE38989-7"},{"id":731086,"accession":"P-GSE38989-8"},{"id":731083,"accession":"P-GSE38989-9"},{"id":731082,"accession":"P-GSE38989-10"},{"id":731084,"accession":"P-GSE38989-3"},{"id":731085,"accession":"P-GSE38989-1"},{"id":731081,"accession":"P-GSE38989-2"},{"id":731089,"accession":"P-GSE38989-4"},{"id":731090,"accession":"P-GSE38989-5"},{"id":731088,"accession":"P-GSE38989-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
