Both types of cyclopentenone oxylipins; induce the expression of genes related to detoxification, stress responses, and secondary metabolism, a profile clearly distinct; from that of the cyclopentanone jasmonic acid. To investigate the role of TGA transcriction factors in oxylipin responses, the regulation of gene expression by OPDA and PPA1 defective in; the expression of TGA2, TGA5, and TGA6 was analyzed using; Affymetrix ATH1 chips.
