Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome Profiling of Roots and leaves Under High Osmotic Stress in Arabidopsis									
Experiment Description	The functions of miRNAs and their target mRNAs in Arabidopsis development have been widely documented, however, roles of stress responsive miRNAs and their targets are not as well understood. Using small RNA deep sequencing and ATH1 microarrays to profile mRNAs, we identified IAR3 (IAA-Ala Resistant 3) as a novel target of miR167a. 2 organs X 3 treatments X 3 replicates  This submission represnts ATH1 microarrays component of study.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = normalized data	Probe synthesis, hybridization and scanning of all arrays were carried out at the Genomics Resource Center in the Rockefeller University following the manufacturer’s manual (Affymetrix).	Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 was used as Wild-type.For hydroponic culture, WT seeds after a 3-day cold treatment at 4degreeC were sowed on rock wool (Grodan Inc.) pre-soaked in MGRL media. In short, plants were grown at 22degreeC with a 150 μmol m-2 S-1 fluorescence rate and under 12 hour / 12 hour light dark cycle in MGRL hydroponic medium.	Background correction was performed as described by Irizarry et al. (2003). Quantile normalization was performed as described by Bolstad et al (2003). Finally, probes were summarized into single gene expression (probe-set) values on a per chip basis using the medianpolish algorithm (Tukey, 1977).	Probe synthesis, hybridization and scanning of all arrays were carried out at the Genomics Resource Center in the Rockefeller University following the manufacturer’s manual (Affymetrix).	Thirty-day-old plants were then subjected to high osmotic stress by adding 0.3M mannitol to the basal MGRL medium for 3 hr in the light. Recovery plants were transfer back to the MGRL medium for 1 day after stress treatment and sampled.	Each array probe for Arabidopsis Genechip ATH1 was synthesized from 1 μg total RNA extracted by RNA easy extraction kit (Qiagen). Eighteen individual Genechip probes with three biological replicates for CL (Col Leaf), CR (Col Root), OL (Osmotic stressed Leaf), OR (Osmotic stressed Root), RL (Recovery Leaf), and RR (Recovery Root).	Probe synthesis, hybridization and scanning of all arrays were carried out at the Genomics Resource Center in the Rockefeller University following the manufacturer’s manual (Affymetrix).
