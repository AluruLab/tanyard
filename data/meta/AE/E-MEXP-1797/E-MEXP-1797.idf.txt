Protocol Description	Cell cultures (4 days after subculture) were treated with 40 µM (v/v) rotenone. Methanol (final volume 0.25% v/v) was also applied on cell cultures as a control. Cells were collected at intervals by filtration and washed with fresh MS medium.	Total RNA from treated and control samples was extracted using Qiagen plant RNeasy kit and genomic DNA was removed using DNAfree DNAse (Ambion). Complete removal of nuclear DNA was checked by PCR on diluted RNA.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	A heterotrophic cell-suspension culture of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Landsberg erecta was maintained on Murashige and Skoog basal salt medium as described by Sweetlove et al. (2002). Cells was routinely grown at 22°C, under the light (100 µE.m-2.s-1) on an orbital shaker (130 rpm) and sub-cultured every 7 days by transferring a volume (about 20 mL) corresponding to 3.5 g of fresh cell weight to 100 mL of fresh MS medium in 250-mL flasks. Cell cultures used in the following experiments were then grown in the dark (22°C) with shaking (130 rpm) for 4 days. <br>(Parameters: start time = 0, stop time = 7, time unit = days, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C, media = MS medium)	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
