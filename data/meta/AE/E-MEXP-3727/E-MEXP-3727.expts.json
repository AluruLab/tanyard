Plants were then shifted to LD (16 hr light, 8 hr dark) conditions to induce flowering. RNA was isolated from micro-dissected apical tissue harvested 0 and 5 days after the shift to LD and double-stranded cDNA was synthesized. Biotinylated cRNA probes were prepared and hybridized to the Affymetrix ATH1 array in duplicate (biological replicates)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Markus Schmid","role":"submitter","email":"Markus.Schmid@tuebingen.mpg.de"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23393265,"authors":"Vanessa Wahl; Jathish Ponnu; Armin Schlereth; Stephanie Arrivault; Tobias Langenecker; Annika Franke; Regina Feil; John E.
