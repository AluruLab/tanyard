Experiment Description	To monitor gene expression changes pre floral transition and during early flower development col-0 and tps1-2 GVG::TPS1 (von Dijken, 2004) plants were grown under SD (8 hr light, 16 hr dark) for 21 days. Plants were then shifted to LD (16 hr light, 8 hr dark) conditions to induce flowering. RNA was isolated from micro-dissected apical tissue harvested 0 and 5 days after the shift to LD and double-stranded cDNA was synthesized. Biotinylated cRNA probes were prepared and hybridized to the Affymetrix ATH1 array in duplicate (biological replicates).

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown at 23°C and 65% rel. humidity on soil. Light conditions: Mixture of Cool White and Gro-Lux Wide Spectrum fluorescent lights, with a fluence rate of 125 to 175 µmol m-2 s-1. <br><br><br>(Parameters: time unit = days, temperature unit = C)	Total RNA was isolated from plant material using Plant RNeasy columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers instructions.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Plants were shifted from short day (SD; 8hr light, 16 hr darkness) to long day (LD; 16 hr light, 8 hr darkness) to synchronously induce flowering.	labeling	hybridization	image_acquisition
