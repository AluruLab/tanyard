Experiment Description	Fungal secondary metabolites can not only cause toxic effects in animals and humans, but also serve as virulence factors of the producing fungi for causing plant diseases.Thus, the severity of plant diseases associated with mycotoxins depend on the sensitivity towards the toxin. In previous experiments, we have evaluated the phytotoxic effect ofa mycotoxin on root growth of Arabidopsis wild-type and mutant seedlings. Mycotoxin treatment of a new conditional root expansion mutant partially restores the expansion phenotype (JE100; Werner et al., unpublished).  AIM: This experiment aims to identify genes, in early and later phases after mycotoxin treatment in wild-type and mutant seedlings. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN: Eight Affymetrix chips are needed for this experiment. RNA preparation will be provided from wild-type, accession Columbia, and mutant seedlings after different time points of mycotoxin treatment. As control, separate seedlings will be treated with the same concentration of solvent (DMSO). Briefly, seeds will be sterilized, stratified for 48 hours and germinated on MS agar plates containing 4.5% sucrose at 22Â°C and 16h/8h light/dark cycles. 10 days after germination, seedlings will be transferred to liquid MS medium and shaken for another 3 days for acclimatization. Seedlings will be harvested after 2 and 24 hours of treatment with a single concentration (50 ÂµM) of mycotoxin. To account for experimental variations (i.e. time needed for freezing the tissues, circadian clock,...), the experiment will be repeated three times and RNA samples will be pooled. EXPECTED RESULTS: The experiment should identify genes differentially expressed:  1) between wild-type and mutant seedlings,  2) upon mycotoxin treatment in wild-type, 3) upon mycotoxin treatment of mutant seedlings and  4) upon solvent treatment.  The results will allow us to pinpoint the mode of action of this mycotoxin. They will also allow us to better understand the function of the mutated gene which affects the sensitivity towards the mycotoxin. Furthermore, we expect to identify the signaling pathway by which the plant responses towards the mycotoxinis triggered.

Protocol Description	Title: Growth protocol. Description: Seeds were first stratified for 48hr. Plants were grown from seed in growth rooms at a temperature of 22C and 50% humidity. The growth medium used was Murashige and Skoog, supplemented with 2.5% Sucrose. The photoperiod was 16hr and then 8hr in the dark; the lighting intensity was 75 umol m-2 s-1. Plants were grown upto growth stage 3.90 as per the Boyes scale.	Title: Growth protocol and 24 hour control treatment. Description: Seeds were first stratified for 48hr. Plants were grown from seed in growth rooms at a temperature of 22C and 50% humidity. The growth medium used was Murashige and Skoog supplemented with 2.5% Sucrose. The photoperiod was 16hr and then 8hr in the dark; the lighting intensity was 75 umol m-2 s-1. Plants were grown upto growth stage 3.90 as per the Boyes scale. After three days of acclimatization plants were treated with solvent (10% DMSO in 0.01 N KOH, 50µl in 10ml medium) for 24 hours as Mock control. Fifteen seedlings were harvested and retained for RNA extraction.	Title: Treatment with zearalenone for 24 hours. Description: After three days of acclimatization plants were treated with 50µM of zearalenone (solved in 10% DMSO in 0.01 N KOH, 50µl in 10ml medium)for 24 hours. Fifteen seedlings were harvested and retained for RNA extraction.	Title: Treatment with zearalenone for 2 hours. Description: After three days of acclimatization plants were treated with 50µM of zearalenone (solved in 10% DMSO in 0.01 N KOH, 50µl in 10ml medium)for 2 hours. Fifteen seedlings were harvested and retained for RNA extraction.	Title: Growth protocol and 2 hour control treatment. Description: Seeds were first stratified for 48hr. Plants were grown from seed in growth rooms at a temperature of 22C and 50% humidity. The growth medium used was Murashige and Skoog, supplemented with 2.5% Sucrose. The photoperiod was 16hr and then 8hr in the dark; the lighting intensity was 75 umol m-2 s-1. Plants were grown upto growth stage 3.90 as per the Boyes scale. After three days of acclimatization plants were treated with solvent (10% DMSO in 0.01 N KOH, 50µl in 10ml medium) for 2 hours as Mock control. Fifteen seedlings were harvested and retained for RNA extraction.	Protocol followed according to manufacturers instructions.	RNA samples were quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 100 pmol T7-(dT)24 primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3')  was hybridized with the Total RNA ( 8 - 12ug) at 70ÃÂ°C for 10 minutes.  First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM ÃÂ-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.
