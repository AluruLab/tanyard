Comment[Submitted Name]	Analysis of genes regulated by AS1 and AS2
Experiment Description	AS1 and AS2 encode MYB related protein and AS2-domain containing protein, respectively and may regulate transcription. These genes are involved in the determination of axes of leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. To know the gene regulation in the leaf development, expression profile among wild-type, as1 and as2 mutants and AS2 overexpression plants were compaired. shoot apices from as1-1, as2-1, AS2 overexpressing, and wild type embryos

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip ATH1. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	Plants were grown on soil under long day condition (16 hours light and 8 hours dark). for 14 days.	The data were analyzed with MSA5.0 using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 200.	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChipR Scanner 3000 7G system.	Shoot apices were harvested.	total RNAs were extracted using RNeasy (QIAGEN)	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
