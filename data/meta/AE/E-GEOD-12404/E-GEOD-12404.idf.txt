Protocol Description	Siliques between 1.6 and 1.9 cm  long containing linear-cotyledon stage seeds were collected from 38-46 day old plants.  Siliques were sub-divided and fixed in 3:1 (v/v) ethanol to acetic acid and embedded in paraffin.  Microdissection of compartments was carried out on sections using a Leica LMD6000 system.	Siliques between 1.0 and 1.1 cm containing pre-globular stage seeds were collected from 38-46 day old plants.  Siliques were sub-divided and fixed in 3:1 (v/v) ethanol to acetic acid and embedded in paraffin.  Microdissection of compartments was carried out on sections using a Leica LMD6000 system.	Plants were grown in a Conviron chamber under continuous light with fluorescent lamps at 20Â&deg;C and 50% - 70% relative humidity.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNaqueous Micro-Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) using a modified protocol incorporating an on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen RNase-Free DNase Set) during column washes.	2 to 5 ng of total RNA was amplified using the WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA). cDNAs were fragmented and labeled with NuGEN FL-Ovationâ¢ cDNA Biotin Module V2.
