Experiment Description	We performed a time course analysis (TC data set) of the response of whole seedling roots to -Fe at 6 time points after transfer (3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours). Little is known about how developmental cues affect the way cells interpret their environment.  Here we characterize the transcriptional response of different cell layers and developmental stages of the Arabidopsis root to high salinity and find that transcriptional responses are highly constrained by developmental parameters.  These transcriptional changes lead to the differential regulation of specific biological functions in subsets of cell-layers, several of which correspond to observable physiological changes.  We show that known stress pathways primarily control semi-ubiquitous responses and use mutants that disrupt epidermal patterning to reveal cell-layer specific and inter-cell-layer effects.  By performing a similar analysis using iron-deprivation we identify common cell-type specific stress responses and environment-independent biological functions that define each cell type. Experiment Overall Design: Seedlings were grown for 5 days before transfer to iron deficient (-Fe) conditions (0.3mM Ferrozine in MS media containing no iron sulfate).  Whole roots were harvested at 6 time points after the transfer.

Protocol Description	Seeds were surface sterilized for 2 minutes in 70% ethanol, the ethanol was removed, then replaced with 30% Bleach and 0.02% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes. Seeds were rinsed 3 times with sterile water, stratified for 4ËC for 2 days, then placed on standard media. Standard media is 1X Murashige and Skoog salt mixture in which ferrous sulfate is replaced with 100mM Fe(III)-EDTA, 0.5g/L MES, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH.  â"Fe media is 1X Murashige and Skoog salt mixture in which ferrous sulfate is replaced with 0.3mM Ferrozine. Nylon mesh was placed on top of the solidified media and seeds were planted at ~20 seeds/cm in two rows.	Seedlings were grown for 5 days before transfer to -Fe media.  Transfers were staggered such that all roots were harvested within 3 hours of each other on the sixth day of growth.  Roots were cut with a razor blade 0.5 mm below the root/hypocotyl junction and collected into RNA extraction buffer.  Approximately 320 roots were collected per replicate, with two biological replicates being performed per time point.  Samples were briefly sonicated to disrupt the tissue.	Approximately 320 roots were collected per replicate.  Samples were briefly sonicated to disrupt the tissue.  RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).	Fragmented cRNA probes were prepared using the one-cycle amplification protocol by Affymetrix.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
