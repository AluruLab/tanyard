Experiment Description	In order to study the Nep1 responsive genes in Arabidopsis, experiments were performed with the Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array (Santa Clara, CA; Cat # 900385).   Experiment Overall Design: Seven-day old Arabidopsis seedlings were exposed to Nep1 (10 ug/mL) treatment or using sterilized, deionized H2O as a control for 30 min.  Two independent biological replications were conducted using two independent samples and two microarrays.

Protocol Description	Approximately 100 sterilized seeds were transferred to sterile 125-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 20 mL of 1X MS basal salts supplemented with 1X vitamin B5, and 0.1 mM MES-NaOH (pH 5.7) buffer.  Seedlings were grown in controlled environment chambers and the flasks were continuously agitated with a rotary shaker for 7 days.  Seedlings were grown in growth chamber at 22Â&deg;C for 7 days under fluorescent lights providing 150 Â± 10 Â&#956;mol /m2/s photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) with 16-h days.

Seedlings were grown in growth chamber at 22Â&deg;C for 7 days under fluorescent lights providing 150 Â± 10 Â&#956;mol /m2/s1 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) with 16-h days.	One-week old seedlings were exposed to Nep1 (10 ï­g mL-1) treatment or using sterilized, deionized H2O as a control.  Seedlings were harvested after 30 min treatment, filtered through Whatman #1 filter paper (Whatman, Middlesex, UK), rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Seedlings were harvested after 30 min treatment, filtered through Whatman #1 filter paper (Whatman, Middlesex, UK), rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.	The harvested whole seedlings were ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle.  Total RNA was extracted using a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described by the manufacturer and then purified with a RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen).
