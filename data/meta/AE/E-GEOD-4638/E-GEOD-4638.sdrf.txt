GSE4638GSM104363	Arabidopsis thaliana	EFO	http://purl.org/obo/owl/NCBITaxon#NCBITaxon_3702	7 days old, MS liquid culture grown seedlings:  In order to study the Nep1 responsive genes in Arabidopsis, experiments were performed with the Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array (Santa Clara, CA; Cat # 900385).  Seven-day old Arabidopsis seedlings were exposed to Nep1 (10 ug/mL) treatment or using sterilized, deionized H2O as a control for 30 min.  Two independent biological replications were conducted using two independent samples and two microarrays. .
