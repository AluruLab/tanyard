Experiment Description	MYB46 functions as a transcriptional switch that turns on the genes necessary for secondary wall biosynthesis. Elucidating the transcriptional regulatory network immediately downstream of MYB46 is crucial to our understanding of the molecular and biochemical processes involved in the biosynthesis and deposition of secondary walls in plants. The transcription factors identified here may include direct activators of secondary wall biosynthesis genes. The current study discovered novel hierarchical relationships among the transcription factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis and generated several testable hypotheses. To gain insights into the MYB46-mediated transcriptional regulation, we first established an inducible secondary wall thickening system in Arabidopsis by expressing MYB46 under the control of dexamethasone inducible promoter. Then, we used ATH1 GeneChip microarray to obtain a series of time-course transcriptome profiles with regard to the induction of secondary wall development.

Protocol Description	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	DEX (dexamethasone, Sigma) treatment was performed to the transgenic Arabidopsis (inducible expression of MYB46) plants were grown on soil for 14 days. DEX was dissolved in water to 1 mM stock and applied with spray at 10 ÂµM with 0.02% silwet surfactant. In relevant experiments, control plants were treated with the same concentration of surfactant in water. After treatment, young rosette leaves (5th ~7th leaf) without petiole were harvested at the indicated times and frozen immediately with liquid N2, then stored until used.	The transgenic Arabidopsis (inducible expression of MYB46) plants were grown on soil in a growth chamber (16 h light/ 8 h dark) at 23 Â°C, after stratification.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Drosophila Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100.
