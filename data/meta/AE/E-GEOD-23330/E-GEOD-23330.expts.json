ABA levels were increase in the mutants relative to the wild type (Col0). Like vtc1 the vtc2 mutants have a slow growth relative to Col0. However, the wild type phenotype is restored in the abi4vtc2 double mutant. Similarly, the sugar sensing phenotype of in the abi4 is reversed in the abi4vtc2 double mutant. The vtc1 and vtc2 leaf transcriptomes show up to 70 % homology with abi4. Of the transcripts that are altered in the mutants a relative to Col0, only a small number are reversed in the abi4vtc2 double mutants relative to either abi4 or vtc2. We conclude that AA controls growth via an ABA and abi4-dependent signalling pathway. The vtc and abi4 mutants have enhanced glutathione levels and common redox signalling pathways leading to similar gene expression patterns.
