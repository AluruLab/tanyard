Experiment Description	Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia glabra were grown for 4 days in the dark without added sucrose. Samples were subsequently kept for 6h either [1] under aerobic conditions, [2] under anoxia in absence of sucrose or [3] under anoxia in presence of sucrose.

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia glabra were grown for 4 days in the dark at 23Â&deg;C in multiwell plates containing half-strenght murashige skoog medium without added sucrose. Sample was subsequently kept for 6h under the same conditions (aerobic)  RNA was extracted using a Ambion RNaqueous kit. Targets were produced using standard Affymetrix procedures from about 10ug of total RNA.  Each independent experiment consisted of four replicated seedlings cultures, pooled after RNA extraction.

Sample was subsequently kept for 6h under anoxia in the presence of 90mM sucrose.  RNA was extracted using a Ambion RNaqueous kit. Targets were produced using standard Affymetrix procedures from about 10ug of total RNA.  Each independent experiment consisted of four replicated seedlings cultures, pooled after RNA extraction.
