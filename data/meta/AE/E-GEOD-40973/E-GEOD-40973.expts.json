Mechanisms that plant growth in the context of pathogen challenge and immunity are unclear. Investigating Arabidopsis infection with the powdery mildew fungus, we find that the Arabidopsis atypical E2F DEL1, a transcriptional repressor known to promote cell proliferation, represses accumulation of the hormone salicylic acid (SA), an established regulator of plant immunity. DEL1 deficient plants are more resistant to pathogens and slightly smaller than wild type. The resistance and size phenotypes of DEL1 deficient plants are due to the induction of SA and activation of immunity in the absence of pathogen challenge. Moreover, Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 5 (EDS5), a SA transporter required for elevated SA and immunity, is a direct repressed target of DEL1. Together, these findings indicate that DEL1 control of SA levels contributes to regulating the balance between growth and immunity in developing leaves. Mature, fully expanded leaves of 41\/2-week-old Col-0 and del1-1 plants were harvested at 5 days after G. orontii infection and from uninfected control plants for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Mary C Wildermuth","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Divya Chandran","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Mary C Wildermuth","role":"submitter","email":"mwildermuth@berkeley.edu"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["4 weeks old at time 0 (inoculation)"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["del1-1 mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"infected","value":["Golovinomyces ororntii infected","no"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["mature, fully expanded leaves"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["del1-1 mutant","wild type"]},{"name":"INFECTED","value":["Golovinomyces ororntii infected","no"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":8,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1003007,"accession":"P-GSE40973-3"},{"id":1003008,"accession":"P-GSE40973-4"},{"id":1003005,"accession":"P-GSE40973-5"},{"id":1003004,"accession":"P-GSE40973-6"},{"id":1003002,"accession":"P-GSE40973-1"},{"id":1003006,"accession":"P-GSE40973-2"},{"id":1003003,"accession":"P-GSE40973-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0}]}]}}
