Protocol Name	P-GSE34047-1	P-GSE34047-6	P-GSE34047-3	P-GSE34047-8	P-GSE34047-7	P-GSE34047-2	P-GSE34047-4	P-GSE34047-5
Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA signal intensity	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized on Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip (Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A) for 16 hours at 45C with rotation at 60rpm.	Arabidopsis plants (Columbia-0 and tbf1 mutant) were grown on soil (Metro Mix 360) at 22ËšC under a 16/8 hr light/dark cycle for 3 weeks	The data were normalized with RMA algorithm using Gene-Spring GX default analysis settings	Immediately following hybridization, the hybridized probe arrays undergo an automated washing and staining protocol on the GeneChip® FS450 fluidic station and are then scanned on the GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G Plus where patterns of hybridization are detected.	Treated with 1 mM SA for 6 hrs (spray) or 10 µM elf18 for 2 hrs (infiltration into leaves). Mock treatments with water were included for both spray and infiltration.	The RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Ambion)	RNA probes were labelled using MessageAmp Premier RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion)
