Experiment Description	Arabidopsis ABA hypersensitive germination2-1 mutant shows an enhanced sensitivity to ABA. This mutant has higher levels of endogenous ABA. This mutant also exhibited SA hypersensitivity and dwarf phenotype. Regarding SA hypersensitivity, ahg2-1 exhibits higher endogenous SA level and an enhanced resistance to pathogenic bacteria. Since AHG2 encodes the Arabidopsis polyA specific ribonuclease that is involved in mRNA degradation, presumably abnormal accumulation of some mRNAs confers the unique phenotype. Transcriptome analyses are expected to offer information on the target of AHG2. In order to eliminate secondary effects of higher levels of ABA and SA, ahg2-1abi1-1 and ahg2-1sid2-2 double mutants were also examined. The transcriptome data revealed that; ahg2-1 confers unique gene expression profiles, ABA and SA affect the expression profiles of this mutant but many genes are independent of those plant hormone responses. Comparing with expression profiles of other mutants indicated that the ahg2-1 might affect mitochondrial function.   Keywords: strain comparison, ABA, SA To investigate the whole genome transcription profiles of an ABA and SA hypersensitive mutant ahg2-1, transcriptome analysis for wild type, ahg2-1, ahg2-1abi1-1, ahg2-1sid2-2 plants were conducted. The plants of those lines were grown on MS-pplante containing 0,2% sucrose for three weeks under normal conditions. Comparing the data among those four lines, the direct targets of the ahg2-1 mutation were analyzed using R. In addition, the deduced data were compared with transcriptome data of various mutants or stimuli deposited in public database.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = probe ID of ATH1 GeneChip<br>VALUE = RMA normalized log2 signal intensity	30 ug cRNA was used. ATH1 GeneChip was used.	The plates were kept in a growth chamber under the following conditions: 23°C, 16 hr light and 8 hr dark cycles.	RMA normalized using Cel file with affllmGUI.	Scanned using a GSC3000 scanner according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.	Plants were grown on MS-2% sucrose plate for three weeks.	Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen).	First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 15 µg of total RNA and SuperScript Double-stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The labeled cRNA was synthesized using BioArray RNA Transcripts Labeling Kit (T7) (ENZO Life Sciences inc.). After labeling, the cRNA was digested partially by incubating in 40 mM Tris-acetate, pH8.0, 100 mM KOAc, 30 mM MgOAc, at 94°C for 35 min. Then 30 µg cRNA was used for microarrary hybridization.
