Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA data	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Gene level values in the matrix table were generated using NimbleScan 2.5 after RMA nomalization.	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5 data<br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Following fragmentation, cRNA was hybridized to the GeneChip Soybean array according to standard protocols (#PM702232; www.affymetrix.com).	Following fragmentation, cRNA was hybridized to the ATH1 Affymetrix slide according to standard protocols (#PM702232; www.affymetrix.com).	Hybridization was performed according to Roche protocols	Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col-0) were imbibed at 4 °C with distilled water for 4d to facilitate uniform germination.  The seeds were resuspended in 0.05% agarose after the cold treatment and planted in pots containing Fafard 3B mix (Conrad Fafard, Agawam, MA).  Plants were grown in a Conviron BDW80 walk-in growth chamber under the following growth conditions: 22 °C, 60% relative humidity, a 10 h photoperiod, and 350 μmol m-2s-1 light intensity. Plants were watered as needed and fertilized weekly using 125 ppm N of Jack's Professional	Dormant cuttings of black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa clone 93-968) averaging ~0.5 cm diameter, 25 cm length, and 2-3 buds were rooted using 0.3% IBA and grown in a Conviron BDW80 walk-in growth chamber at 22 °C, 60% relative humidity, a 18 h photoperiod, and 350 μmol m-2s-1 light intensity. Plants were watered as needed and fertilized weekly according 250 ppm N using Jack's professional.	Soybean (Glycine max cv.Williams 82), were grown in pots containing Fafard 3B soil.  Plants were grown in a Conviron BDW80 walk-in growth chamber under the following growth conditions: 22 °C, 60% relative humidity, a 10 h photoperiod, and 350 μmol m-2s-1 light intensity. Plants were watered as needed and fertilized weekly using 125 ppm N of Jack's Professional	Signal values were determined using GeneChip MAS5.0 algorithm.	All data were analyzed using the limma package in the Bioconductor software (v.2.4). Gene level information for RMA normalized expression values are presented within the matrix for all samples analyzed.	Images of all scanned slides were aligned using NimbleScan version 2.5 and pair reports were created using the slide design file provided by Roche NimbleGen. An annotation package for this array was created using the pdInfoBuilder (v.2.4) Bioconductor open access package run in the R statistical framework (R Development Core Team, 2007).	Dried slides were scanned using an Agilent Scanner (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with a PMT gain of 100% at 5 µm resolution.	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 according to standard protocol (#PM702232; www.affymetrix.com).	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 according to standard protocol #PM702232; www.affymetrix.com.	Fully expanded leaf samples from 4 randomly collected plants per species were harvested at 4 physiological states as determined from prior gas exchange measurements (growth temperature - baseline, photosynthetic optimum, 20% inhibition of optimum and 30% inhibition of optimum). The temperature response curves were created by increasing temperature step-wise (2 °C per 10 mins) from 22 to 42 °C to the desired physiological state and waiting 20-30 mins for photosynthesis to stabilize before sampling. Each curve took 3-4 h to complete.	For the microarray analysis, fully expanded leaf samples from 4 randomly collected plants per species were harvested at 4 physiological states as determined from prior gas exchange measurements (growth temperature - baseline, photosynthetic optimum, 20% inhibition of optimum and 30% inhibition of optimum). The temperature response curves were created by increasing temperature step-wise (2 °C per 10 mins) from 22 to 42 °C to the desired physiological state and waiting 20-30 mins for photosynthesis to stabilize before sampling. Each curve took 3-4 h to complete.	total RNA was converted to ds cDNA using a SuperScript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen Corp) according to the protocol provided by Roche for NimbleGen high-density microarrays.	Total RNA was isolated from 100 mg of tissue using an RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  An on-column DNase 1 treatment (Sigma-Aldrich) was used during RNA extraction to remove any potential genomic DNA contamination.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	RNase A cleanup, cDNA precipitation and sample labeling were carried out according Roche provided protocol
