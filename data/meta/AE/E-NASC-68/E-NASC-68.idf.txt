Experiment Description	The protein modules known as SH2 (Src-homology-2) domains are key players in the signal transduction of animals. Two questions arise: Do such modules exist in plants, and when did SH2 domains evolve? Here I show that the Arabidopsis genome contains three strong candidates for plant SH2 proteins (referred to as PASTA1, 2 and 3 : GI:25513455, At1g78540, At1g17040 respectively) with homology to the SH2 domains and the adjacent linker region of STAT proteins (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription). The three characteristics features of a STAT protein sequence1, namely, (i) the SH2 domain with a conserved arginine residue crucial for binding to a phospho-tyrosine residue (ii) a tyrosine residue outside the C-terminus of the SH2-domain  for phosphorylation during signalling and (iii) a DNA-binding domain, are conserved in the PASTA3 protein. However, PASTA 1 and 2 proteins lack a tyrosine in a similar position. PASTA proteins are not homologous to STAT proteins outside the SH2 and linker regions. The three PASTA proteins are 70 to 80 % identical to one another. Gene expression studies with PASTA2 reveal that it is expressed in roots, stem, leaves, flowers and green siliques. Preliminary indications are that plants homozygous for PASTA2 do not have any obvious phenotype, most likely due to redundancies.  This microarray experiment is an attempt to compare the gene expression of a mutant plant  homozygous for PASTA2 with that of the wild type plant. This might give clues about the possible function of PASTA2 in Arabidopsis.

Protocol Description			Protocol: Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol 	RNA samples were quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 100 pmol T7-(dT)24 primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3')  was hybridized with the Total RNA ( 8 - 12ug) at 70 Â°C for 10 minutes. First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM ÃÂ-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.
