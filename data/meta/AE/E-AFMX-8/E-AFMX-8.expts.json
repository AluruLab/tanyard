Of the environmental factors, photoperiod is regarded the most important one in promoting floral transition in Arabidopsis thaliana and most labstrains will flower earlier under long day (LD) conditions than under short day (SD) conditions. Arabidopsis is therefore considered a facultative LD plant. To monitor gene expression changes during floral transition and early flower development plants were grown under SD (9 hr light, 15 hr dark) for 30 days. Plants were then shifted to LD (16 hr light, 8 hr dark) conditions to induce flowering. RNA was isolated from micro-dissected apical tissue harvested 0, 3, 5, and 7 days after the shift to LD and double-stranded cDNA was synthesized. Biotinylated cRNA probes were prepared and hybridized to the Affymetrix ATH1 array in duplicate (biological replicates). To study floral transition, we not only analyzed response of wildtype Landsberg erecta (Ler) plants, but also the effect of mutants in the flowering time genes CONSTANS (CO; co-2) and FT (ft-2). Early flower development was analyzed by comparing Col-0 wildtype plants with the meristem identity mutant lfy-12 (Col-0)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Markus Schmid","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jan Lohmann","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Detlef Weigel","role":"submitter","email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":14573523,"authors":"Markus Schmid, N Henriette Uhlenhaut, Francois Godard, Monika Demar, Ray Bressan, Detlef Weigel, Jan U Lohmann","title":"Dissection of floral induction pathways using global expression analysis.","issue":24,"pages":"6001-12","publication":"Development","volume":130,"year":2003}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"BioSourceProvider","value":["Department of Molecular Biology, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":[" rosett stage","rosett stage"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["co (CS175)","Col-0 wildtype with an AG::GUS reporter","ft (CS184)","Ler with an AG::GUS reporter","lfy-12"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["mutant","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":[" apical region","apical region"]},{"category":"SampleType","value":["fresh_sample"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"duration","value":[3,5,7,"none"]},{"name":"ecotype","value":["co (CS175)","Col-0 wildtype with an AG::GUS reporter","ft (CS184)","Ler with an AG::GUS reporter","lfy-12"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["mutant","wild_type"]},{"name":"photoperiod","value":["long day","short day"]},{"name":"replicate","value":[1,2]},{"name":"treatment","value":["3 days long day condition","5 days long day condition","7 days long day condition","no treatment"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":40,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":143,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4"},{"id":77,"accession":"P-AFFY-2"},{"id":20050,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Percentile"},{"id":20051,"accession":"P-AFFY-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":40,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":40,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":40,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":40,"isderived":0}]}]}}
