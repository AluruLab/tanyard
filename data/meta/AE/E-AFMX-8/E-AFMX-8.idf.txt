Experiment Description	Floral transition and flower development are regulated by numerous environmental and endogenous signals, which are integrated at a relatively small number of floral integrators, such as FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS OVEREXPRESSION 1 (SOC1). Of the environmental factors, photoperiod is regarded the most important one in promoting floral transition in Arabidopsis thaliana and most labstrains will flower earlier under long day (LD) conditions than under short day (SD) conditions. Arabidopsis is therefore considered a facultative LD plant. To monitor gene expression changes during floral transition and early flower development plants were grown under SD (9 hr light, 15 hr dark) for 30 days. Plants were then shifted to LD (16 hr light, 8 hr dark) conditions to induce flowering. RNA was isolated from micro-dissected apical tissue harvested 0, 3, 5, and 7 days after the shift to LD and double-stranded cDNA was synthesized. Biotinylated cRNA probes were prepared and hybridized to the Affymetrix ATH1 array in duplicate (biological replicates). To study floral transition, we not only analyzed response of wildtype Landsberg erecta (Ler) plants, but also the effect of mutants in the flowering time genes CONSTANS (CO; co-2) and FT (ft-2). Early flower development was analyzed by comparing Col-0 wildtype plants with the meristem identity mutant lfy-12 (Col-0).
