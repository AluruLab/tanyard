Protocol Description	Three independent biological replicates, each composed of leaves pooled from at least 28 different plants, were used per experimental condition.	Total RNA was extracted from 50 to 100mg of tissues using Trizol. RNA samples were then purified using RNeasy mini kit.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Two rosette leaves were treated with heat (40C), high light (1000uE) or wounding and meristems were sampled at 15 and 45min following stress treatment. Samples were also collected in parallel from plants that were exposed to control treatments corresponding to each stress. 	Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were grown on peat pellet for 3 weeks under controlled conditions (21C, 16h light).<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)	labeling	hybridization	image_acquisition	bioassay_data_transformation
