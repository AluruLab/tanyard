Seed sterilisation: Seed were surface sterilized in 70% ethanol for 2 min, immediately followed by 8 min in 50% bleach, and then were rinsed twice in sterile distilled water. Growth protocol: Seedlings were plated on Murashige-Skoog 1.5% agar medium containing 3% sucrose and grown for 6 days under constant light of  55-60 micro mol m-2sec-1 cool white fluorescent light. They were then entrained for 4 days at 22Â°C under (12 hr/12 hr) light/dark cycles of 75 micro mol m-2sec-1 cool white fluorescent light. At dawn on the 4th day of entrainment seedlings were transferred to constant 25 micro mol m-2sec-1 cool white fluorescent light at 27Â°C..
