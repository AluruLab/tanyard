Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data for Arabidopsis pah1 pah2 mutant plants
Experiment Description	PHOSPHATIDIC ACID PHOSPHOHYDROLASE (PAH) catalyses the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol. Disruption of two gene encoding this enzyme in Arabidopsis thaliana results in increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis and proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum (Eastmond et al., [2010] Plant Cell 22: 2796). We performed microarray analysis on two week old wild type Arabidopsis plants and the pah1 pah2 double mutant using the Ath1 chip to determine what effect the double mutation has on global gene expression.

Protocol Description	Seeds of wild type and pah1 pah2 double mutant were surface sterilised and sown on agar plates containing 1/2 strength MS salts (Sigma-Aldrich). Plants were grown on vertically orientated plates in a growth chamber set at 21°C 16 h light/18°C 8 h dark; Photon Flux Density = 150 μmol m−2 s−1	DNase-treated total RNA was isolated from pools of ten two week old Arabidopsis plants of each genotype using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45oC on GeneChip Drosophila Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 500.
