Experiment Description	We used Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 for all experiments. The plants were grown hydroponically on nutrient solution as described previously [Plant J 1999, 18(5):509-519]. Briefly, plants were grown on sand, placed in custom-designed styrofoam rafts, in a growth chamber (EGC, Chagrin Falls, OH, USA) at 22°C with 60 mmol photons m-2s-1 light intensity and 8 h/16 h light/dark cycles. The seeds were initially germinated in tap water. After one week, the water was replaced with a complete nutrient solution [Plant J 1999, 18(5):509-519]. All the experiments were performed with 6 week old plants. Nutrient solutions were renewed weekly and on the day before the experiments. For treatments, individual rafts were transferred to containers with 300mL of nutrient solution supplemented with various concentrations of nitrate (as a mix of 2/1 KNO3/Ca(NO3)2) and/or sucrose. The N-free nutrient solutions contained 0.25 mM K2SO4 and 0.25 mM CaCl2 instead of KNO3 and Ca(NO3)2. Plants were transferred to treatments media at the beginning of the light period and were harvested 8h afterwards. Roots and leaves were harvested separately and quickly frozen in liquid N2.

Plants were transferred to treatments media at the beginning of the light period and were harvested 8h afterwards. Roots and leaves were harvested separately and quickly frozen in liquid N2. All experiments were carried out in duplicate with the exception of the no sucrose/no nitrate treatment which was performed four times.	We used Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 for all experiments.

Total RNA extraction was performed as described previously [Plant Mol Biol 1992, 19:563 - 572]. 	Total RNA extraction was performed as described previously [Plant Mol Biol 1992, 19:563 - 572]. cDNA was synthesized from 8µg total RNA using T7-Oligo(dT) promoter primer and reagents recommended by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA). Biotin-labeled cRNA was synthesized using the Enzo BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo, NY). The concentration and quality of the cRNA was evaluated by A260/280nm reading and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. We used 15µg of labeled cRNA to hybridize the Arabidopsis ATH1 Affymetrix gene chip for 16 h at 42°C. Washing, staining and scanning were performed as recommended by Affymetrix.
