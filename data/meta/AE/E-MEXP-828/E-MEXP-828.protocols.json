The plants were grown hydroponically on nutrient solution as described previously [Plant J 1999, 18(5):509-519]. Briefly, plants were grown on sand, placed in custom-designed styrofoam rafts, in a growth chamber (EGC, Chagrin Falls, OH, USA) at 22°C with 60 mmol photons m-2s-1 light intensity and 8 h\/16 h light\/dark cycles. The seeds were initially germinated in tap water. After one week, the water was replaced with a complete nutrient solution [Plant J 1999, 18(5):509-519]. All the experiments were performed with 6 week old plants. Nutrient solutions were renewed weekly and on the day before the experiments. For treatments, individual rafts were transferred to containers with 300mL of nutrient solution supplemented with various concentrations of nitrate (as a mix of 2\/1 KNO3\/Ca(NO3)2) and\/or sucrose. The N-free nutrient solutions contained 0.25 mM K2SO4 and 0.25 mM CaCl2 instead of KNO3 and Ca(NO3)2. Plants were transferred to treatments media at the beginning of the light period and were harvested 8h afterwards. Roots and leaves were harvested separately and quickly frozen in liquid N2.
