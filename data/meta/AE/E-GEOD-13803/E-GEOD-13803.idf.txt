Experiment Description	We have previously identified a significant increase in chloroplast reactive oxygen species in wounded leaves of Arabidopsis and other plants, which is light-dependent (Flor-Henry et al. (2004) BMC Plant Biology 4:19). The aims of this study were to (i) examine the early response to mechanical wounding in Arabidopsis leaves, (ii) test the hypothesis that light-dependent chloroplast ROS may play a role in signalling for changes in gene expression in wounded leaves, and (iii) examine the broader impact of the light environment on the wound response in Arabidopsis.  Keywords: Stress response The experiment was a two-by-two factorial design, with wounding and light as the two variables. In each replicate, there are 4 treatments: unwounded/light, unwounded/dark, wounded/light, wounded/dark. Three independent biological replicate experiments were performed, with one array hybridisation performed per treatment.

Protocol Description	Surface-sterilised seeds were grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog basal salt mixture, adjusted to pH 5.8 with 1 M KOH, with 1% sucrose and 0.6% plant cell tissue culture grade agar, in a controlled environment growth room following a 10/14 hour light/dark regime with PAR of 250 Âµmol m-2 s-1 and temperatures of 20 Â± 2Âº C. Ten-day-old seedlings were subsequently transplanted to a sieved, pre-autoclaved compost and sand mixture (3:1) and plants grown in individual pots (Aracon system) in the same controlled environment growth room. Plants were watered daily by spraying.	Control plants were left to acclimatise for 30 min in controlled environment growth cabinets at 22Âº C in the light (PAR - 250 Âµmol m-2 s-1) with relative humidity between 55-60%. Plants were then left under these conditions for a further 60 min, after which whole rosettes were cut off at the base of the stem and frozen in liquid nitrogen.	Plants were left to acclimatise for 30 min in controlled environment growth cabinets at 22Âº C in the light (PAR - 250 Âµmol m-2 s-1) with relative humidity between 55-60%. Subsequently, rosette leaves were mechanically wounded using a metal haemostat, once or twice dependent on size, so that a wound site is present at any point on the leaf within a 1cm radius. Leaves were wounded closest to the largest width of the leaf and perpendicular to the mid-vein. Wounded plants were returned to the same controlled environment for a further 60 min in the light, after which whole rosettes were cut off at the base of the stem and frozen in liquid nitrogen.	Plants were left to acclimatise for 30 min in controlled environment growth cabinets at 22Âº C in the dark, with relative humidity between 55-60%. Plants were then left under these conditions for a further 60 min, after which whole rosettes were cut off at the base of the stem and frozen in liquid nitrogen.	Plants were left to acclimatise for 30 min in controlled environment growth cabinets at 22Âº C in the dark, with relative humidity between 55-60%. Plants were then wounded in the dark under a 15 watt Kodak safe light with a yellow 0B filter (PAR - 0 Âµmol m-2 s-1). Rosette leaves were mechanically wounded using a metal haemostat, once or twice dependent on size, so that a wound site is present at any point on the leaf within a 1cm radius. Leaves were wounded closest to the largest width of the leaf and perpendicular to the mid-vein. Wounded plants were returned to the same controlled environment for a further 60 min in the dark, after which whole rosettes were cut off at the base of the stem and frozen in liquid nitrogen.	DW	For each treatment, a single RNA extract was made from 15-17 pooled individuals. Frozen plant tissue was ground to a fine powder in a pre-cooled pestle and mortar with liquid nitrogen and acid-washed sand, and transferred to a 15 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube. 2 ml well mixed RNA extraction buffer (1:1 mix of phenol and 0.1 M LiCl, 0.1 M Tris.Cl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA and 1% SDS) at 95ÂºC was added per gram of fresh weight plant material and tubes vortexed until thoroughly mixed. Half a volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was added and mixed well by vortexing. After centrifugation in a bench top centrifuge at 3500 x g for 10 min at 4ÂºC, the upper aqueous phase was removed to a new 15 ml centrifuge tube and re-extracted with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol before centrifugation for a further 10 min as before. The aqueous phase was removed to a new centrifuge tube and mixed with an equal volume of 4 M LiCl and incubated overnight at 4ÂºC. Tubes were then centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 x g at 4ÂºC to pellet precipitated RNA. The supernatant was removed and the pellet drained and resuspended in 300 Âµl 0.3 M NaOAc pH 5.2, before being transferred to an Eppendorf tube. RNA was re-precipitated by the addition of 750 Âµl cold ethanol, followed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 14000 rpm. Pellets were drained and rinsed in 70% ethanol and left to dry on the bench, for ~ 30 min, under a 60 W lamp, after which pellets were resuspended in 50-100 Âµl ddH2O. 100 Âµg of RNA was purified using a Qiagen RNeasy kit, using the specified protocol (RNeasyÂ® Mini Handbook, Fourth Edition, April 2006).	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 microg total RNA.	Following fragmentation, 10 microg of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C and at 60 rounds/min.  The GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400 and 450.
