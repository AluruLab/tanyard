(2004) BMC Plant Biology 4:19). The aims of this study were to (i) examine the early response to mechanical wounding in Arabidopsis leaves, (ii) test the hypothesis that light-dependent chloroplast ROS may play a role in signalling for changes in gene expression in wounded leaves, and (iii) examine the broader impact of the light environment on the wound response in Arabidopsis.  Keywords: Stress response The experiment was a two-by-two factorial design, with wounding and light as the two variables. In each replicate, there are 4 treatments: unwounded\/light, unwounded\/dark, wounded\/light, wounded\/dark. Three independent biological replicate experiments were performed, with one array hybridisation performed per treatment."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Michael R Roberts","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Joke Allemeersch","role":"submitter","email":"joke.allemeersch@vib.be"},{"contact":"Dawn Worrall","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Krishna Morker","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"BioSourceProvider","value":["M.R.
