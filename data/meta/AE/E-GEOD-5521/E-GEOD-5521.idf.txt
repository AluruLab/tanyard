Experiment Description	The aim of this experiment is to understand the impact of overexpression of ERD15 on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana. ERD15 was isolated from a screen for genes rapidly induced after pathogen treatment from Arabidopsis. This gene was originally found as early responsive to drought (Kiyosue et al., 1994, Plant Physiol 106, 1707). ABA is central phytohormone in drought response, but increasing information is pointing to its significant role in pathogen responses as well. We are interested to see the effect of this hormone on plants overexpressing ERD15 compared to control plants. The samples (rosette leaves)will be harvested from 3-week old soil grown plants 90 min after spraying with 100 micromolar ABA. Comparison will be made with non-treated plant samples.

Protocol Description	ABA-treated: The plants were sprayed with 100 microM ABA (diluted in distilled water, stock solution of ABA in 70%EtOH, so the final concentration of EtHO is 0,07%). The samples were collected after 90 min. Rosette leaves from three plants were pooled.	oex-non-treated: The plants were sprayed with distilled water containing 0,07% EtOH (=control for ABA treatment). The samples were collected after 90 min. Rosette leaves from three plants were pooled.	oex-ABA-treated: The plants were sprayed with 100 microM ABA (diluted in distilled water, stock solution of ABA in 70%EtOH, so the final concentration of EtOH is 0,07%). The samples were collected after 90 min. Rosette leaves from three plants were pooled.	The plants were sprayed with distilled water containing 0,07% EtOH (=control for ABA treatment).
