ERD15 was isolated from a screen for genes rapidly induced after pathogen treatment from Arabidopsis. This gene was originally found as early responsive to drought (Kiyosue et al., 1994, Plant Physiol 106, 1707). ABA is central phytohormone in drought response, but increasing information is pointing to its significant role in pathogen responses as well. We are interested to see the effect of this hormone on plants overexpressing ERD15 compared to control plants. The samples (rosette leaves)will be harvested from 3-week old soil grown plants 90 min after spraying with 100 micromolar ABA. Comparison will be made with non-treated plant samples.
