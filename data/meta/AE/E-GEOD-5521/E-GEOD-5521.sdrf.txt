Growth protocol: The seeds were germinated on Â½ x MS media (0,7% agar, 2% sucrose, 0,1% MES, pH 5,7) containing 50 Âµg/ml kanamycin. After 5-7 days the seedlings were transferred to pots containing a mixture of peat and vermiculite (1:1). The plants were grown in a growth room with a temperature of 22ÂºC and a relative humidity of 70%. The photoperiod was 12 h of light and 12 h of dark.
