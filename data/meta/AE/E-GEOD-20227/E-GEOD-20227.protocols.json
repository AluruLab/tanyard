Briefly fresh tissue (pool of 20 plants) was collected manually and weighed. Immediately placed in liquid nitrogen and grinded with a mortar and pestle until a fine powder was obtained. According to the initial weight powder was decanted in liquid nitrogen-cooled Rnase-free microcentrifuge tubes (100mg of initial material per tube, ex if initial material was 500mg then powder divided in 5 tubes and in label specified they were from the same extraction). 500 microlitres of buffer RLT previously adjusted with B-mercaptoethanol was added to the samples and the tubes were placed in a vortex, vortexing for 5 minutes vigorously (Vortex Genie-2, setting 9, Scientific Industries). The lysate was pipetted directly onto a QIAshredder spin column and centrifuged for 2 minutes at 16.1g (Eppendorf Centrigue 5415D). 0.5V of ethanol was added to the cleared lysate, mixed by pipetting, applied onto the Rneasy mini column and centrifuged for 30 s at 14.7g. The column was after washed with buffer RW1 twice (first with 700 microlitres and after with 350 microlitres) and the on-column Dnase digestion performed. Dnase I solution was prepared by mixing 10 microlitres of Dnase I (1500 Kunits in 550 microlitres of Rnase-free water) with 70 microlitres of buffer RDD. 80 microlitres of Dnase I solution per sample was added onto the Rneasy silica-gel membrane and digestion was allowed for 15 minutes at 20 Celsius degrees. After the incubation time, columns were washed with 350 microlitres of buffer RW1 and centrifuged for 30 s at 14.7g. Then columns were placed into a new collection tube and washed with 500 microlitres of RPE buffer and centrifuged as before (30s, 14.7g). A final wash with 500 microlitres of RPE was carried out and samples were centrifuged for 2 minutes, at 14.7g. The columns were then placed in a new collection tube and centrifuged at 16.1g for 1 minute. Next, columns were placed into new Rnase free-collection tubes and 50 microlitres of Rnase-free water pipetted directly onto the membrane and incubated for 10 minutes before elution. To elute, samples were centrifuged for 1 minute at 14.7g. Concentration of RNA as well as the Ratio A260\/A280 was determined for each sample. All the samples with a ratio near 2.0 from the same liquid-nitrogen grinded step were pool in the same collection tube and the RNA was precipitated. For the precipitation procedure, 1\/10 volume of NaAC and 2 volumes of ethanol 100% were added to the pooled sample mixed by vortex and incubated overnight at -20 Celsius degrees. Next day samples were centrifuged 10 minutes at 16.1g and the pellet was washed once with ethanol 70%, centrifuged for 10 minutes at 16.1g and air-dried. Dryed pellets were resuspended in 30 microliters of Rnase-free water and concentration and Ratio A260\/A280 determined. Samples with high quality were selected for the experiment.","type":"nucleic_acid_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1174064,"accession":"P-GSE20227-4","name":null,"text":"Labelled using protocol described in manual Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, One-Cycle target labelling","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1174063,"accession":"P-GSE20227-5","name":null,"text":"Biotin Labelled cRNA using Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA","type":"hybridization","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1174059,"accession":"P-GSE20227-6","name":null,"text":"Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.","type":"image_acquisition","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1174058,"accession":"P-GSE20227-7","name":null,"text":"Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm.
