Seeds were surface sterilised 10 minutes with 50% bleach, 0.2% SDS and rinsed 5 times with sterile water before sowed. Growth Room Commercial soil Levington M2 professional growing medium from The Scotts company (UK) Ltd (Paper Mill lane, Bramford, Ipswich, Suffolk, IP8 4BZ) lug-3 flowers show characteristic class A floral homeotic gene mutation defects ; sepals are staminoid/carpeloid, second whorl petals are either staminoid or absent and third-whorl stamens are fewer in number. The fourth whorl gynoecium exhibits unfused carpels with valves forming hornlike protrusions at the apex. These defects in floral organ identity and floral organ number were previously explained to be caused by ectopic expression of AG mRNA. AG independent defects are displayed by LUG mutants, and include abnormal carpel and ovule development, reduced female and male fertility, and narrower leaves and floral organs, suggesting that LUG has a wider role in floral development and a function in vegetative development. Further defects in vegetative development include first leaves variable in size between individuals, in the majority of the cases being smaller than wild type, possibly as a result of a retarded seedling development. Mature rosette leaves generally have longer petioles than wild type leaves. Plants are shorter with increased shoot branching, and develop between 6-10 lateral inflorescences from the rosette, which result in the development of many more inflorescences than wild type plants.	lug-3 in Ler-0 background, flowers	P-GSE20227-2	P-GSE20227-3	GSM507068 extract 1	total RNA	P-GSE20227-4	GSM507068 LE 1	biotin	P-GSE20227-5	GSM507068	A-AFFY-2	P-GSE20227-6	P-GSE20227-7	  	  	GSM507068.CEL	ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/data/experiment/GEOD/E-GEOD-20227/E-GEOD-20227.raw.1.zip	P-GSE20227-1	GSM507068_sample_table.txt norm	GSM507068_sample_table.txt	ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/data/experiment/GEOD/E-GEOD-20227/E-GEOD-20227.processed.1.zip	flower	lug-3 mutant
