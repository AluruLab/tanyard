Experiment Description	Seed dormancy is the inability for seeds to germinate even under favorable conditions.  In the Arabidopsis Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>) ecotype, 2 weeks of dry storage, called after-ripening, is sufficient to relieve seed dormancy.  Such seed is referred to as after-ripened (AR) and has a high rate of germination when imbibed.  While widespread transcriptome changes have been previously observed with seed dormancy loss, this experiment was designed to characterize transcriptional changes associated with the increased seed dormancy and dormancy loss of the gibberellin (GA) hormone-insensitive <i>sleepy1-2</i> (<i>sly1-2</i>) mutant.  The <i>SLY1</i> gene encodes the F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase needed for GA-triggered proteolysis of DELLA repressors of seed germination.  In the <i>sly1-2</i> mutant, GA-directed DELLA proteolysis cannot occur leading to DELLA protein accumulation and increased dormancy.  <i>sly1-2</i> mutant seeds are fully dormant at 2 weeks of dry storage (0% germination), but germinate well with very long after-ripening (51% germination after 19 months).  <i>sly1-2</i> seed germination can also be rescued by overexpression of the GA receptor, <i>GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF1b</i> (<i>GID1b-OE</i>), which resulted in 74% germination at 2 weeks of dry storage.  In this experiment, we compared seeds of wild-type L<i>er</i> at 2 weeks of dry storage (non-dormant), dormant <i>sly1-2</i> (2 weeks of dry storage; <i>sly1-2</i>(D)), long after-ripened <i>sly1-2</i> (non-dormant, 19 months of dry storage; <i>sly1-2</i>(AR)), and <i>sly1-2 GID1b-OE</i> (non-dormant, 2 weeks of dry storage).  Samples were collected at two imbibition timepoints: 1) a 0h timepoint after 4 days at 4°C, and 2) a 12h timepoint after 4 days at 4°C followed by 12 hours in the light at 22°C.  These timepoints were selected to capture the transcriptomes at an early and late time in Phase II of imbibition.  Using this experimental design we were able to determine transcriptome differences associated with seed dormancy in the <i>sly1-2</i> mutation (L<i>er</i> wt vs <i>sly1-2</i>(D)), and changes associated with <i>sly1-2</i> dormancy loss through dry after-ripening (<i>sly1-2</i>(AR) vs <i>sly1-2</i>(D)) or through <i>GID1b</i>-overexpression (<i>sly1-2 GID1b-OE</i> vs <i>sly1-2</i>(D)).  Seeds for L<i>er</i> wt, <i>sly1-2</i>(D), and <i>sly1-2 GID1b-OE</i> were grown alongside each other under the same conditions and after-ripened for 2 weeks.  Seeds from <i>sly1-2</i>(AR) were grown under the same conditions in advance of the other lines to allow for the long after-ripening requirement.  RNA was extracted using a phenol-chloroform-based extraction from three biological replicates per treatment.

Protocol Description	In this experiment, we compared seeds of wild-type L<i>er</i> at 2 weeks of dry storage (non-dormant), dormant <i>sly1-2</i> (2 weeks of dry storage; <i>sly1-2</i>(D)), long after-ripened <i>sly1-2</i> (non-dormant, 11 months of dry storage; <i>sly1-2</i>(AR)), and <i>sly1-2 GID1b-OE</i> (non-dormant, 2 weeks of dry storage). For RNA extraction, 20 mg of dry seed per sample was sown on filter paper moistened with sterile 0.5× MS salts buffered with 5mM MES, pH 5.5.  Seeds were collected at two timepoints: 1) a 0h timepoint harvested immediately after cold stratification for 4 d at 4°C in the dark, and 2) a 12h timepoint incubated 12h in the light at 22°C following the 4 d cold stratification at 4°C.	The 3.75 µgs of cDNA was fragmented and biotinylated and that entire amount was hybridized to the GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array.	GeneChips were scanned according to Affymetrix protocols.	Amplification and labeling was performed using the Applause 3’-Amp System (p/n 5100-24) and the Encore Biotin Module (p/n 4200-12) from the company NuGEN.  Based on the manufacturer’s protocols, we started with 200 ng of total RNA for the 3’-amp kit and 3.75 µg of amplified cDNA (generated from the amp kit) was used as the input for the Biotin module.	RNA isolation was performed using a phenol-chloroform extraction developed for tough tissues such as Arabidopsis seeds based on Oñate-Sánchez and Vicente-Carbajosa (2008) with an additional chloroform extraction and the use of Phase Lock (5-PRIME) gel tubes to allow complete recovery of the aqueous phase without risk of organic phase contamination.	Data analysis of raw CEL files was performed using the LIMMA package as part of the Bioconductor suite of tools in the R statistical programming environment (Gentleman et al., 2004; Smyth, 2005; R Core Team, 2014).  Background correction and normalization was performed by Robust Multi-array Average (RMA), control probesets were removed, and significance was determined by False Discovery Rate (FDR) with α = 0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Irizarry et al., 2003).
