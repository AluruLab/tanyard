Experiment Description	Columbia (Col) seeds were sown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, supplemented with 1% sucrose and 0.8% agar and grown vertically in culture room conditions. The 5-d-old homogenous seedlings were washed five times with sterile water and lastly with liquid half strength MS medium without sugar to remove residual exogenous sugar. In order to deplete internal sugars seedlings were grown in sugar free liquid half strength MS medium for 24 h in dark.  Thereafter, the seedlings were treated with half-strength MS medium containing 0% G, 0% G + 1 uM BAP, 3% G, and 3% G + 1 uM BAP for 3 h in dark. RNA was extracted and microarray analysis was performed. Please note: G stands for glucose and BAP stands for 6-Benzylaminopurine (cytokinin)

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-30976	P-MTAB-30977	P-MTAB-30978
Protocol Description	The GeneChip arrays were washed and then stained on an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450, followed by scanning on an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 Scanner 7G. The results were quantified and analyzed using Expression Console ver.1.1 software (Affymetrix, Inc.) (Parameters: Scanning hardware = OTHER: Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 Scanner 7G, Scanning software = Scanning software)	RNA was extracted and microarray analysis was performed.  (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = PCR)	Columbia (Col) seeds were sown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, supplemented with 1% sucrose and 0.8% agar and grown vertically in culture room conditions. The 5-d-old homogenous seedlings were washed five times with sterile water and lastly with liquid half strength MS medium without sugar to remove residual exogenous sugar. In order to deplete internal sugars seedlings were grown in sugar free liquid half strength MS medium for 24 h in dark.  Thereafter, the seedlings were treated with half-strength MS medium containing 0% G, 0% G + 1 uM BAP, 3% G, and 3% G + 1 uM BAP for 3 h in dark.
