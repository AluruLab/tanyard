In order to deplete internal sugars seedlings were grown in sugar free liquid half strength MS medium for 24 h in dark.  Thereafter, the seedlings were treated with half-strength MS medium containing 0% G, 0% G + 1 uM BAP, 3% G, and 3% G + 1 uM BAP for 3 h in dark.","type":"growth protocol","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null}]}}
