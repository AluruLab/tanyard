The 5-d-old homogenous seedlings were washed five times with sterile water and lastly with liquid half strength MS medium without sugar to remove residual exogenous sugar. In order to deplete internal sugars seedlings were grown in sugar free liquid half strength MS medium for 24 h in dark.  Thereafter, the seedlings were treated with half-strength MS medium containing 0% G, 0% G + 1 uM BAP, 3% G, and 3% G + 1 uM BAP for 3 h in dark. RNA was extracted and microarray analysis was performed. Please note: G stands for glucose and BAP stands for 6-Benzylaminopurine (cytokinin)"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Ashverya Laxmi","role":"submitter","email":"ashverya_laxmi@nipgr.ac.in"}],"bibliography":[{"status":"not yet submitted"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["6 day"]},{"category":"BioSourceType","value":["frozen_sample"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"strain","value":["Columbia"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND_1","value":["glucose"]},{"name":"COMPOUND_2","value":["BAP (6-Benzylaminopurine)"]},{"name":"DOSE_1","value":["0 millimolar","166 millimolar"]},{"name":"DOSE_2","value":["0 millimolar","10 millimolar"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":702792,"accession":"P-MTAB-30978"},{"id":702791,"accession":"P-MTAB-30976"},{"id":702793,"accession":"P-MTAB-30977"},{"id":77,"accession":"P-AFFY-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
