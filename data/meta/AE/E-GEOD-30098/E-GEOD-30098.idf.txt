Investigation Title	Expression analysis time-course of Arabidopsis roots to sulfur deficiency							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression analysis time-course of Arabidopsis roots to sulfur deficiency							
Experiment Description	We preformed at time-course of the expression of whole Arabidopsis roots for 3H, 12H, 24H, 48H and 72H after transfer to media lacking sulfur. We combined these data with 13 other datasests and performed a meta-analysis to ask whether a universal stress response exists in Arabidopsis roots. Stress responses in plants are tightly coordinated with developmental processes, but the interaction between these pathways is poorly understood. Here we use genome-wide assays at high spatial and temporal resolution to understand the processes that lnk development and stress in the Arabidopsis root. Our meta-analysis finds little evidence for a universal stress response. Common stress responses appear to exists and, analagous to animal systems, many of them show cell-type specificity, suggesting a convergent evolutionary theme in multicellular organisms. Common stress responses may be mediated by cell identity regulators, as mutations in these genes resulted in altered responses to stress. Our results reveal surprising linkages between stress and development at cellular resolution, and show the power of multiple genome-wide datasets to elucidate biological processes. 2 replicates of each timepoint (3H, 12H, 24H, 48H, 72H) and the 0H control.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Signal<br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	hybs with fragmented cRNA were preformed by Expression Analysis (Durham, NC)	Seedlings were grown for 5 days on standard MS media before transfer either to standard (0H) or sulfur deficient media for the indicated time	CHP files contain MAS 5.0 probe set summarizations using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The mean target intensity of each array was set to 250.	scans were preformed by Expression Analysis (Durham, NC)	Seeds were surface sterilized with 50% Bleach and 0.1% Tween for 5 minutes and then rinsed 3 times with sterile water. Seeds were stratified at 4˚C for 2 days before being planted on media standard media. At 5 days, seedlings were transferred to fresh standard (0H) or sulfur deficient media for the indicated time. Sulfur deficient media is composed of 20.6 mM NH4NO3, 18.8 mM KNO3, 1.25 mM KPO4H2, 5 μM KI, 2.99 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM H3BO3, 1 μM Na2MoO42H2O, 0.1 μM CoCl26H2O, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA2H20, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 μM CuCl2, 0.1mM FeCl2, 0.1 mM MnCl2, 0.03 mM ZnCl2, 0.05% MES, 1% sucrose, 1% agar.	Total RNA was extracted with Qiagen Rneasy Plant mini kit according to manufacturer's instructions	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix one-cycle protocol from 1 ug total RNA
