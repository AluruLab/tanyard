We combined these data with 13 other datasests and performed a meta-analysis to ask whether a universal stress response exists in Arabidopsis roots. Stress responses in plants are tightly coordinated with developmental processes, but the interaction between these pathways is poorly understood. Here we use genome-wide assays at high spatial and temporal resolution to understand the processes that lnk development and stress in the Arabidopsis root. Our meta-analysis finds little evidence for a universal stress response. Common stress responses appear to exists and, analagous to animal systems, many of them show cell-type specificity, suggesting a convergent evolutionary theme in multicellular organisms. Common stress responses may be mediated by cell identity regulators, as mutations in these genes resulted in altered responses to stress. Our results reveal surprising linkages between stress and development at cellular resolution, and show the power of multiple genome-wide datasets to elucidate biological processes. 2 replicates of each timepoint (3H, 12H, 24H, 48H, 72H) and the 0H control."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Terry Jackson","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Anjali S Iyer-Pascuzzi","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Philip N Benfey","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Anjali S Iyer-Pascuzzi","role":"submitter","email":"asi2@duke.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":22014526,"authors":"Iyer-Pascuzzi AS, Jackson T, Cui H, Petricka JJ, Busch W, Tsukagoshi H, Benfey PN.","title":"Cell identity regulators link development and stress responses in the Arabidopsis root.","doi":"10.1016\/j.devcel.2011.09.009","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GROWTH CONDITION","value":["standard media","sulfur deficient media"]},{"name":"TREATMENT TIME","value":["0 hours","12 hours","24 hours","3 hours","48 hours","72 hours"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":441929,"accession":"P-GSE30098-8"},{"id":441928,"accession":"P-GSE30098-7"},{"id":441930,"accession":"P-GSE30098-6"},{"id":441931,"accession":"P-GSE30098-2"},{"id":441934,"accession":"P-GSE30098-3"},{"id":441933,"accession":"P-GSE30098-4"},{"id":441932,"accession":"P-GSE30098-5"},{"id":441927,"accession":"P-GSE30098-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
