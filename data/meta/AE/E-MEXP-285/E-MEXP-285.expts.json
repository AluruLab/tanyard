While essential for the life cycle of higher plants, the genetic basis underlying most of the process is not well understood. We used Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays covering more than 80% of the Arabidopsis genome to compare transcriptomes of cell-sorted, hydrated pollen grains with those of flowers, leaves, seedlings and siliques (all samples with duplicates). This comparison revealed that pollen expresses a reduced set of genes with increased proportions of enriched and selectively-expressed transcripts. Relative gene ontology (GO) category representations in pollen and vegetative tissues revealed a functional skew of the pollen transcriptome towards signaling, vesicle transport and cytoskeleton, suggestive of a commitment towards germination and tube growth. Relative gene ontology (GO) category representations in pollen and vegetative tissues reveal a functional skew of the pollen transcriptome towards signaling, vesicle transport and cytoskeleton, suggestive of a commitment towards germination and tube growth. Relative gene ontology (GO) category representations in pollen and vegetative tissues reveal a functional skew of the pollen transcriptome towards signaling, vesicle transport and cytoskeleton, suggestive of a commitment towards germination and tube growth. Gene family and pathway analysis allowed formulation of novel hypotheses for the role of non-classical MADS-box genes, small RNA pathways and cell cycle components in pollen."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Cristina Pina","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"José A Feijó","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Francisco Pinto","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jörg D Becker","role":"submitter","email":"jbecker@igc.gulbenkian.pt"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":15908605,"authors":"Pina, Cristina; Pinto, Francisco; Feijo, Jose A.; Becker, Jorg D.","title":"Gene Family Analysis of the Arabidopsis Pollen Transcriptome Reveals Biological Implications for Cell Growth, Division Control, and Gene Expression Regulation","doi":"10.1104\/pp.104.057935","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":[1,14,16,"n\/a"]},{"category":"BioSourceType","value":["fresh_sample"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["  ","seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["flower","fruit","male gametophyte","rosette leaf","whole_organism"]},{"category":"TimeUnit","value":["weeks"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"AGE","value":["1 weeks","14 weeks","16 weeks","n\/a weeks"]},{"name":"ORGANISM PART","value":["flower","fruit","male gametophyte","rosette leaf","whole_organism"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":10,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":416773,"accession":"P-MEXP-7911"},{"id":178,"accession":"P-MEXP-7912"},{"id":180,"accession":"P-MEXP-7913"},{"id":179,"accession":"P-MEXP-7914"},{"id":79337,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4[]"},{"id":416770,"accession":"P-MEXP-7925"},{"id":416771,"accession":"P-MEXP-7923"},{"id":416772,"accession":"P-MEXP-7922"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":181,"accession":"P-MEXP-7920"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":10,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":10,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
