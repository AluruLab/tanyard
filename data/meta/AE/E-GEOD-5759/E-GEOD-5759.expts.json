We treated dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings with lincomycin, sampled them before or after a short illumination and examined the genomic response using Affymetrix ATH1 oligonucleotide microarrays. Differentially regulated genes were ranked based on descending degree of significance (p-value) and the top 50 genes affected by lincomycin in dark grown seedlings and top 50 genes affected by the antibiotic after illumination were selected for further analysis. Experiment Overall Design: 2*2 factorial design, two variables are (1) with\/without lincomycin treatment (2) with\/without red  illumination. There are 2 replicates for each condition."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Fangxin Hong","role":"submitter","email":"fhong@salk.edu"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["4 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND","value":["lincomycin","none"]},{"name":"GROWTH CONDITION","value":["constant darkness","darkness followed by 30 min red light"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":8,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":430136,"accession":"P-G5759-1"},{"id":430137,"accession":"P-G5759-3"},{"id":430138,"accession":"P-G5759-2"},{"id":430135,"accession":"P-G5759-5"},{"id":430139,"accession":"P-G5759-4"},{"id":430140,"accession":"P-G5759-6"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
