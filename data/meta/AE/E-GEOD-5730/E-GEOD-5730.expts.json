Cryosectioned embryos of ecotype Col-O of globular, heart and torpedo stage were used to isolate cell clusters from the apical and basal regions, for RNA isolation and amplification. !Samples will be provided as T7-primed cDNA, with three biological replicates for each tissue to be analysed. Each replicate comprises cDNA from pooled tissue samples from ca. 15 embryos. The experimental details have been discussed with Sean May et al. at NASC.
