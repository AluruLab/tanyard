Experiment Description	Brassinosteroid (BR) homeostasis and signaling are crucial for normal growth; and development of plants. BR signaling through cell-surface receptor; kinases and intracellular components leads to dephosphorylation and; accumulation of the nuclear protein BZR1. How BR signaling regulates gene; expression, however, remains unknown. Here we show that BZR1 is a; transcriptional repressor that has a previously unknown DNA binding domain; and binds directly to the promoters of feedback-regulated BR biosynthetic; genes. To identify additional BZR1-regulated genes and to understand the; BR-regulated transcriptional pathways, we examined the effects of bzr1-1D; and det2 mutations on the expression of BR-regulated genes by using the; Arabidopsis full-genome oligo microarray (Affymetrix). Microarray analyses; identified additional potential targets of BZR1 and illustrated, together; with physiological studies, that BZR1 coordinates BR homeostasis and; signaling by playing dual roles in regulating BR biosynthesis and downstream; growth responses.
