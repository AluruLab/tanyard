Experiment Description	Synchronized induction of flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (Col-0) and flowering time mutants (soc1, agl24, fd) by shifting from short day (8 hr light, 16 hr dark; 23C; 65% rel humidity) to long day (16 hr light, 8 hr dark; 23C; 65% rel humidity) for 0, 3, 5, and 7 days. Biotinylated probes were synthesized from RNA isolated from manually disseted shoot meristems and hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays.

Protocol Description	25-30 shoot apical meristems of Arabidopsis thaliana were micro-dissected and snap frozen on liquid nitrogen per biological replicate.	Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown at 23C and 65% rel. humidity on soil. Light conditions: Mixture of Cool White and Gro-Lux Wide Spectrum fluorescent lights, with a fluence rate of 125 to 175 umol m-2 s-1.  (Parameters: time unit = days, temperature unit = C)	Plants were shifted from short day (SD; 8hr light, 16 hr darkness) to long day (LD; 16 hr light, 8 hr darkness) to synchronously induce flowering.	Total RNA was isolated from plant material using Plant RNeasy columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers instructions. (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Biotinylated antisense RNA was prepared from 1 µg total RNA using the MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturers instructions, except that in vitro transcription was carried out o/n (16 hr).  (Parameters: Amount of nucleic acid labeled = 1, Amplification = RNA polymerases, Mass unit = Micro gram)
