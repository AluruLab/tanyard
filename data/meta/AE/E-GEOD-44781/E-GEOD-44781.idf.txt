Investigation Title	Expression data for plant compensatory responses							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data for plant compensatory responses
Experiment Description	Plant compensatory responses depends on transcriptional reprogramming. We used microarray analysis to understand the differential gene expression pattern between clipped (herbivore browsed) and unclipped plant. Arabidopsis ecotypes Columbia and Landsberg erecta were chosen due to their differential compensatory response. The plants were grown in greenhouse. At bolting stage the plants were clipped to imitate herbivore damage. Following day the samples were collected from clipped and unclipped plants.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = rma normalized	Following fragmentation, 2 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Drosophila Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	3 day cold treated seeds were planted in 3 inch circular pots containing sunshine plant mix. Plant were grown in greenhouse with 16:8 light and dark cycles.	The data was analysed using R software	GeneChips were scanned using GeneArray Scanner G2500A.	Plants were clipped at bolting to simulate mammalian herbivore damage	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 2 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
