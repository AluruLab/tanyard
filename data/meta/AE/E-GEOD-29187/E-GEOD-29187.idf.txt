Investigation Title	Impact of RAP2.12 alterations on gene expression in hypoxic and aerobic conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana								
Comment[Submitted Name]	Impact of RAP2.12 alterations on gene expression in hypoxic and aerobic conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana								
Experiment Description	"In this study we analyzed the effect of overexpression of an HA-tagged version of the ERF RAP2.12 on the transcriptome levels in aerobic and hypoxic-treated (O2 21% and 1%, respectively) Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes. We also analyzed the effect of a RAP2.12 and RAP2.2 simultaneous silencing in aerobic and hypoxic-treated (O2 21% and 1%, respectively) Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes. We treated Arabidopsis Col-0 (wt) rosettes and transgenic HA::RAP2.12 and amiRAP2.2-12 , 5-week old, grown in 8/16 light/dark photoperiod with: -Control (22°C, dark, 21% O2, 1.5h). -Hypoxia (22°C, dark, 1% O2, 1.5h)."

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = GC-RMA normalized probeset abundance	Affymetrix standard hybridization protocol	Seeds were sown in 6-cm diameter pots containing moisted Arabidopsis soil. The seeds were stratified at 4°C in the dark for 2 days and then the pots were moved in a growth chamber at short photoperiodic conditions (8h light 16 h darkness) with 18°C in the night and 22°C in the day.	GC-RMA algorithm	Affymetrix standard scan protocol	"Plants were kept in the dark at a 1% O2 atmosphere for 1.5h starting the treatment at 10am in the morning, 2h after the start of the day"	"Plants were kept in the dark at a 21% O2 atmosphere for 1.5h starting the treatment at 10am in the morning, 2h after the start of the day"	Total RNA was extracted from whole 5-week old plants using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. RNA was processed for use on Affymetrix Arabidopsis Genome GeneChip arrays.	Affymetrix standard labeling protocol
