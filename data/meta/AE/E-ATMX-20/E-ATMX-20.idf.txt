Protocol Description	"Plants were grown in 12 hour days, 90-160 uE and ~24C until 4 weeks old in soil. Plants were watered every 2-3 days and fertilized with 0.5X Hoaglands every fortnight."	The 35S:ZAT10 construct was made by cloning the PCR amplified ZAT10 (At1g27730) coding sequence from Col-0 into HindIII digested and blunt-ended binary vector containing the double CaMV 35S promoter. The resulting binary vector was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens which was used for floral dip transformation of wild type (Col-0). Kanamycin resistant transformants were selected on MS medium and transferred to soil for further characterization.	Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Protocol (QIAGEN) including an on-column DNase treatment using the RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturerÂ’s instructions. The quality of the RNA was verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer and spectrophotometric analysis to determine concentration and the A260 to A280 and A260 to A230 ratios. 	"Preparation of labelled cRNA from 1-5 ug of total RNA was carried out exactly as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, using the Affymetrix One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents."
