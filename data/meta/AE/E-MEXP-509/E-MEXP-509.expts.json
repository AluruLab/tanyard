GFP-tagged virus supplied a visualized marker for us to localize the viral infection foci and its expansion on leaf under UV light. Initially, we dissect an individual infection focus and its adjacent region into four parts and define those four parts as zone 0, 1, 2, and 3, which represented different viral infection stages respectively. Corresponding fours parts were also dissected from control plant treated with turnip leaf sap only. This process was replicated three times totally."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Chunling Yang","role":"submitter","email":"chunyang@iastate.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":17427806,"authors":"Yang C, Guo R, Jie F, Nettleton D, Peng J, Carr T, Yeakley JM, Fan JB, Whitham SA","title":"Spatial analysis of arabidopsis thaliana gene expression in response to Turnip mosaic virus infection"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["7 week"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["rosette leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"infect","value":["mock","Turnip mosaic virus"]},{"name":"sampling site","value":["zone 0","zone 1","zone 2","zone 3"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":24,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":79278,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2[]"},{"id":1166345,"accession":"P-MEXP-9801"},{"id":1166346,"accession":"P-MEXP-9800"},{"id":1166343,"accession":"P-MEXP-9805"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":1166342,"accession":"P-MEXP-9807"},{"id":1166344,"accession":"P-MEXP-9806"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":24,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":24,"isderived":0}]}]}}
