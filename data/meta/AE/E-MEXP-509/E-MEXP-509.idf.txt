Experiment Description	A model system of Potyvirus turnip mosaic virus and Arabidopsis was used in this experiment. GFP-tagged virus supplied a visualized marker for us to localize the viral infection foci and its expansion on leaf under UV light. Initially, we dissect an individual infection focus and its adjacent region into four parts and define those four parts as zone 0, 1, 2, and 3, which represented different viral infection stages respectively. Corresponding fours parts were also dissected from control plant treated with turnip leaf sap only. This process was replicated three times totally.

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis Col-0 plants <br> 10 hours light/dark cycle<br> temperature 22 C<br> till 7 weeks old, before bolting	At 7 weeks of age, 7-8 rosette leaves from each of 6 plants were dusted with Carborundum (Fisher) and rub-inoculated with a cotton-stick applicator soaked in virus sap that was diluted and titered as described above. As a control, a corresponding set of six plants were dusted with carborundum and leaves were mock-inoculated with a cotton-stick applicator that was soaked in uninfected turnip sap diluted in phosphate buffer.	a 1.2 mm Harris Micro Punch (Whatman) was used to dissect 3-7 TuMV-GFP foci per leaf into 4 zones under UV illumination at 120 hours after infection. Corresponding leaf punches were dissected from the mock-inoculated plants. Leaf punches were immediately placed into tubes filled with RNAlaterTM solution (Ambion) and stored at -20 C. All the leaf punches from the same treatment and zone were pooled together to yield 8 total samples. 	Total RNA was isolated using Phenol-free total RNA isolation Kit --RNAqueousTM (Ambion), and the concentration and quality of each sample were determined spectrophotometrically and validated by Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. 	The RNA samples (50 ng) were then amplified and labeled with the OvationTM Biotin RNA Amplification and Labeling System (NuGEN) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
