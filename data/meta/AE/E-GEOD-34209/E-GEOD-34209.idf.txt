Investigation Title	Transcriptome analysis of genes regulated by overexpression of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) in Arabidopsis thaliana							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome analysis of genes regulated by overexpression of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) in Arabidopsis thaliana							
Experiment Description	The Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) is expressed in the boundary between the shoot apical meristem and initiating lateral organs. To identify genes regulated by LOB activity, we used an inducible 35S:LOB-GR line. This analysis identified genes that are differentially expressed in response to ectopic LOB activity. 35S:LOB-GR and Col wild-type seedlings were treated with dexamethasone (DEX) or mock-treated. Three biological replicates were conducted for each treatment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Log2 RMA signal	Standard Affymetrix protocol.	Nine-day-old seedlings, grown on MS plates.	R/Bioconductor, RMA normalization.	Standard Affymetrix protocol.	Seedlings were flooded with MS medium with or without 5ÂµM DEX and incubated, with shaking, for 4 hours.	Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol, followed by purification over RNeasy columns (Qiagen).	Standard Affymetrix protocol.
