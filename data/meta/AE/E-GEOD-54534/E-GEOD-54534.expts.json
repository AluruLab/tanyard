ROS homeostasis is controlled through a complex network of ROS production and scavenging enzymes. Recently, the first genes involved in ROS perception and signal transduction have been identified and, currently, we are facing the challenge to uncover the other players within the ROS regulatory gene network. The specificity of ensuing cellular responses depends on the type of ROS and their subcellular production sites. Various experimental systems, including catalase-deficient plants, in combination with genome-wide expression studies demonstrated that increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels significantly affect the transcriptome of plants and are capable of launching both defence responses and cell death events. We used microarrays to assess differential gene expression provoked by H2O2 from plastid or peroxisomal origin, respectively. Columbia-0 (Col-0, wild type), catalase-deficient Salk plants  (10-15% of wild-type catalase activity; cat2-2; N576998; (Queval et  al., 2007)) and A. thaliana plants expressing glycolate oxidase in  chloroplasts (GO5 plants; (Fahnenstich et al., 2008)) were grown in  soil under a 16h light\/8h dark regime at photosynthetically active  photon flux densities (PPFD) of 75 µmol quanta m-2 s-1 at 22°C  day\/18°C night temperatures and a CO2 concentration of 3,000 ppm.  After three weeks of growth, plants were transferred to ambient CO2  concentration (380 ppm) and the same PPFD. Whole rosettes were  harvested at 0h and 8h after transfer. Control samples were harvested  at 8 h from plants continuously maintained in high CO2."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Nasser Sewelam","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Veronica Maurino","role":"submitter","email":"Veronica.Maurino@uni-duesseldorf.de"},{"contact":"Katrien Van der Kelen","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Nils Jaspert","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Frank Van Breusegem","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Vanesa B Tognetti","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jessica Schmitz","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Elia Stahl","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jürgen Zeier","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Veronica G Maurino","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Henning Frerigmann","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["3 week"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["cat2-2 mutant","glycolate oxidase overexpression in chloroplasts","wild type"]},{"category":"growth condition","value":["continuously maintained in high CO2","transferred to ambient CO2 concentration"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["rosette"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["cat2-2 mutant","GO overexpression","wild type"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["continuously maintained in high CO2","transferred to ambient CO2 concentration"]},{"name":"time","value":["0 hour","8 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":27,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1169175,"accession":"P-GSE54534-7"},{"id":1169176,"accession":"P-GSE54534-6"},{"id":1169177,"accession":"P-GSE54534-5"},{"id":1169179,"accession":"P-GSE54534-4"},{"id":1169178,"accession":"P-GSE54534-3"},{"id":1169180,"accession":"P-GSE54534-2"},{"id":1169174,"accession":"P-GSE54534-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":27,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":27,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":27,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":27,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":27,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":27,"isderived":0}]}]}}
