We sought to test at the transcriptomic level if Arabidopsis mutants lacking all phytochromes (from phyA to phyE), or just retaining trace levels of phyC, had transcriptional response to red light exposure. phyABCDE and phyABDE mutants were grown for 4 days in darkness (D), or under continuous red light at 50 µmol m-2 s-1 (R50), or in darkness followed by 2 hr of red light exposure on day 4 (DR2h). Differentially expressed genes of the mutants in response to red light were compared to those of wild type obtained previously {Hu et al. (2009) Molecular Plant, 2: 166-182}. Three biological replicates were employed for dark and Rc-grown samples, and 2 biological replicates for DR2h samples, thus 8 samples were used for each mutant genotype. It needs to be pointed out that 5 of the 6 WT samples (from WT-D-2 to WT-R50-2) had previously been deposited with GEO accessions GSM226267, GSM226268, GSM226269, GSM226278 and GSM226279. Their cRNA samples were synthesized and labeled with the Affymetrix GeneChip® Expression Analysis kits (One-cycle target labeling and control reagents). They are included in this series of study for convenient comparison, with newly assigned accessions from GSM784837 to GSM784841. The more recent GeneChip 3' IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix) was used to synthesize and label aRNA for one new WT sample (WT-D-1)(GSM784836) and all mutant samples."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Wei Hu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"J C Lagarias","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Wei Hu","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23302690,"authors":"Hu W, Franklin KA, Sharrock RA, Jones MA, Harmer SL, Lagarias JC","title":"Unanticipated regulatory roles for Arabidopsis phytochromes revealed by null mutant analysis","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1221738110"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["4 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Landsberg ecotype"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["phyABCDE quintuple mutant","phyABDE quadruple mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["phyABCDE quintuple mutant","phyABDE quadruple mutant","wild type"]},{"name":"light","value":["4 days dark regimen and 2 hours of red light regimen","continuous dark (no light) regimen","red light regimen"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":22,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1169292,"accession":"P-GSE31587-8"},{"id":1169291,"accession":"P-GSE31587-7"},{"id":1169293,"accession":"P-GSE31587-6"},{"id":1169294,"accession":"P-GSE31587-5"},{"id":1169297,"accession":"P-GSE31587-4"},{"id":1169296,"accession":"P-GSE31587-3"},{"id":1169295,"accession":"P-GSE31587-2"},{"id":1169290,"accession":"P-GSE31587-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":22,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":22,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":22,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":22,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":22,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":22,"isderived":0}]}]}}
