Protocol Description	Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on MS media for 14 days	The seedlings were immersed in MS (liquid) +10 uM BA for 60 minutes. Control samples where immersed in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) for 60 minutes.	Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy plant kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen)
