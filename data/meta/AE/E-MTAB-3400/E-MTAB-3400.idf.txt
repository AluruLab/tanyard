Investigation Title	Response of two clavata 1 mutants to Ralstonia solanacearum.
Comment[Submitted Name]	Response of two clavata 1 mutants to Ralstonia solanacearum.
Experiment Description	In this experiment, we compared transcriptome of 2 homozygous knock out mutants in the CLV1 gene (clv1-12 and clv1-13) to their wild type Ws-2 when challenged with the virulent Rd15 strain of Ralstonia solanacearum. The two mutants show a significant delay of symptom appearance. The experiment was conducted on roots and leaves of 4 week old plants harvested at the time of inoculation and when the first symptoms appeared on the susceptible wild type (4 days after inoculation).
