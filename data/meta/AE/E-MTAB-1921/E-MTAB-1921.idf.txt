Comment[Submitted Name]	Yu_systemic light
Experiment Description	Responsive genes in covered apex with light irradiation on rosette leaves are revealed by the expressional profiling. Normalized data is included as an additional file. It was created via the following protocol: The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 500.																							
Experimental Design	Arabidopsis inflorescence is covered as complete dark, whereas rosette leaves are illuminated with light. After three days treatment, covered apices are collected for RNA extraction and microarray analysis.

Protocol Description	WT plant were grown in growth chambers under a 16/8-h, 22C/20C day/night cycle, with white fluorescent light, at light intensity: 100 umol m-2 s-1.	WT plant grow under LD until bolting, then transfer to continuous light for six days (LL). Plants are irradiated with W, cR, cFR, and cB with inflorescence covering, and DD as control. For different qualities of light treatment, the inflorescence-covered plants were irradiated with red (10 umol m-2 s-1), far-red (1.13 W m-2), and blue light (15 umol m-2 s-1)	As handbook of Rneasy Plant mini extract kit (Qiagen)	10 ug total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis, labeled by in vitro transcription followed by fragmentation following the manufactorys suggestion (GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual rev5, Affymetrix).
