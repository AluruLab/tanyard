Seeds were sown onto pre-sterilized cellophane that was placed on top of an agar growth medium  consisting of half-strength MS medium with 1% (w\/v) sucrose, 1.2% (w\/v) agar in square (100 mm X 315 mm) Petri dishes. Seeds were stratified for 2 d at 4 °C in the dark and then exposed to white light for 2 h at room temperature to synchronize germination. Seedlings were grown for 7 d in the dark at 23 °C before being transferred to either red light (1 h) or continued darkness. Seedlings were immersed in 100 uL RNAlater® (Ambion, TX) in pre-sterilized tubes and stored at -80˚C until RNA extraction.","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0},{"id":16336,"accession":"P-G13383-2","name":"P-G13383-2","text":"Red light treatments were for 1h at fluence rate, through the red filter of ~10 μmol m-2 s-1 with a transmission maximum of 630 nm.

Grinding was continued until there were no remaining visible particulates (~4 min).  Lysis buffer (450 uL; RLT buffer, Qiagen, CA) was added to each sample, and the tubes were vortexed for 5 seconds. RNA was further isolated from the disrupted plant seedling using the RNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA) and residual DNA was removed by performing an on-column digestion using an RNAse-free DNAse kit (Ambion, TX).","type":"nucleic_acid_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0}]}}
