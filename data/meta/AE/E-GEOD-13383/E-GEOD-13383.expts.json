We characterize the early gene expression patterns of seedlings exposed to 1 hour of red light using a small sized sample of 5, 7-day-old seedlings and also performed dark controls. Methods that were developed for tissue extraction and labeling for microarrays were tested using these samples Experiment Overall Design: Only 5, 7 day-old dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings were treated as described and harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We pooled samples from one Petri plate with MS medium 2% sucrose.  Treatment was 1 hour of red light 630 nm (max) and dark controls"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Melanie Correll","role":"submitter","email":"correllm@ufl.edu"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":2,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":16335,"accession":"P-G13383-1"},{"id":16337,"accession":"P-G13383-4"},{"id":16334,"accession":"P-G13383-3"},{"id":16336,"accession":"P-G13383-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":2,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":2,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":2,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":2,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
