Experiment Description	Red light can affect a variety of responses in Arabidopsis.  We characterize the early gene expression patterns of seedlings exposed to 1 hour of red light using a small sized sample of 5, 7-day-old seedlings and also performed dark controls. Methods that were developed for tissue extraction and labeling for microarrays were tested using these samples Experiment Overall Design: Only 5, 7 day-old dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings were treated as described and harvested for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We pooled samples from one Petri plate with MS medium 2% sucrose.  Treatment was 1 hour of red light 630 nm (max) and dark controls

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler) seeds were sterilized in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min, two rinses of 90% (v/v) ethanol and four rinses in sterile ddH2O. Seeds were sown onto pre-sterilized cellophane that was placed on top of an agar growth medium  consisting of half-strength MS medium with 1% (w/v) sucrose, 1.2% (w/v) agar in square (100 mm X 315 mm) Petri dishes. Seeds were stratified for 2 d at 4 Â°C in the dark and then exposed to white light for 2 h at room temperature to synchronize germination. Seedlings were grown for 7 d in the dark at 23 Â°C before being transferred to either red light (1 h) or continued darkness. Seedlings were immersed in 100 uL RNAlaterÂ® (Ambion, TX) in pre-sterilized tubes and stored at -80ËC until RNA extraction.	Red light treatments were for 1h at fluence rate, through the red filter of ~10 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 with a transmission maximum of 630 nm.  Dark treatment were continued in the dark	Samples were removed from the -80 Â°C freezer and warmed to room temperature (25 Â°C) until all of the RNAlaterÂ® had thawed (~5 min).  Thawed samples were ground directly in the microcentrifuge tube using a sterilized pestle tip and the Pellet PestleÂ® Motor (Kontes, NJ).  Grinding was continued until there were no remaining visible particulates (~4 min).  Lysis buffer (450 uL; RLT buffer, Qiagen, CA) was added to each sample, and the tubes were vortexed for 5 seconds. RNA was further isolated from the disrupted plant seedling using the RNeasyÂ® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA) and residual DNA was removed by performing an on-column digestion using an RNAse-free DNAse kit (Ambion, TX).	RNA amplification and labeling was performed by the OvationÂ® biotin system protocol (NuGEN CA).20 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using a chimeric cDNA/mRNA primer, and a second complimentary cDNA strand was synthesized. cDNA then was amplified with ribo-SPIAâ¢ enzyme and SPIA DNA/RNA primers (NuGEN, CA). Amplified DNA was purified with Zymo Research DNA Clean and Concentrator-25â¢ (Zymo Research), cleaved to produce 50- to 100-bp fragments, and biotinylated.	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
