Experiment Description	 Expression of the OX1 gene coding for a putative protein kinase was shown to be induced in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Col-0, WS and RLD seedlings by treatment with H2O2 superoxidecolddroughtsalt and cellulase (elicitor). All of these treatments will ultimately lead to production of H2O2 either as a secondary effect of the applied stress through disturbance of electron transport processes or as a direct product of the plant NADPH oxidases (oxidative burst). However the sets of protective genes switched on (end-responses) will differ depending on the original stress. The induction characteristics of OX1 point to a role of this kinase in signal transduction downstream of H2O2; however it is not clear which primary signal is relayed. OX1 may function in the perception of oxidative stress caused by all/any one of the environmental stresses and/or it may be important in signalling downstream of the oxidative burst triggered by pathogen infection and wounding. An OX1 knock-out was isolated from the Wisconsin T-DNA lines with an insertion between the first and second conserved kinase domains rendering the protein product non-functional. Aim of the microarray experiment is to compare gene induction in the homozygous knock-out line to that in the wild-type (ecotype WS) following H2O2 treatment. To this end 7 day-old seedlings will be immersed in 10 mM solution for 1 h. Analysis of differences in expression of genes belonging to a certain end-response will disclose the signalling pathway which OX1 functions in. This is necessary for further planned experiments e.g. analysis of inducible OX1 antisense and constitutive lines as well as kinase activity assays.

Protocol Description	At 7 days, seedlings immersed in H2O2 for 1 hour 		Protocol: Seedlings harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA extracted as described in the Qiagen RNAeasy kit. 	RNA samples were quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 100 pmol T7-(dT)24 primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3')  was hybridized with the Total RNA ( 8 - 12ug) at 70ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â°C for 10 minutes.  First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM ÃƒÂƒÃ‚ÂŸ-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.
