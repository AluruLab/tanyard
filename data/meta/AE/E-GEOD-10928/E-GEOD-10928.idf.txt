Experiment Description	Comparison of wild-type and vip3.  The Arabidopsis thaliana VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE (VIP) gene class has multiple functions in development, including repression of flowering through activation of MADS box gene FLC. Among VIP genes, VIP genes encode yeast Paf1 complex homolog which is required for histone modification, transcriptional elongation.   To identify genes regulated by VIP3, we performed Affymetrix Arabidopsis gene chip analysis and compared gene transcription profiles from wild-type and vip3 mutant plants. We found more than 200 genes misregulated in vip3 mutant plants compring to wild-type plant.  Experiment Overall Design: Plants were grown on soil. Total aerial tissues were harvestedfrom 14 day old seedling. Each of two replicates for each genotypes was composed of three independently derived samples. Each sample included more than 100 plants. Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNAeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Synthesis of cDNA employed the SuperScript double-stranded cDNA sysnthesis kit (Affymetrix). Synthesis of biotinylated cDNA utilized the BioArray high yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Affymetrix). Hybridization and scanning of microarrays was performed at the Research Techonology Support Facility at Michigan State University. Microarray data were analyzed using the statistical algorithms within the Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS) 5.0 software.
