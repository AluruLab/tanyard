Investigation Title	G3P triggered changes in systemic transcriptome							
Comment[Submitted Name]	G3P triggered changes in systemic transcriptome							
Experiment Description	"Goal of this study was to determine changes in transcription profile in mock versus G3P treated plants. Arabidopsis (Col-0 ecotype) plants were infiltrated with petiole exudate, with or without G3P, and distal leaves were sampled 24 h post treatments.  Keywords: Glycerol-3-Phosphate, Exudate, Salicylic acid, Arabidopsis, Systemic Acquired Resistance, Defense 3 mock-treated and 3 G3P-treated biological replicates were analyzed (one array each) Total RNA was isolated from four-week-old plants using TRIZOL method.  The experiment was carried out in triplicate and a separate group of plants was used for each set. RNA was processed and hybridized to the Affymetric Arabidopsis ATH1 genome array GeneChip following the manufacturers instructions (http://www.affymetrix.com/Auth/  support/downloads/manuals/expression_analysis_technical_manual.pdf <http://www.affymetrix.com/Auth/%20support/downloads/manuals/expression_analysis_technical_manual.pdf> ). All probe sets on the Genechips were assigned hybridization signal above background using Affymetrix Expression Console Software v1.0 (http://www.affymetrix.com/Auth/support/downloads/manuals  /expression_console_userguide.pdf <http://www.affymetrix.com/Auth/support/downloads/manuals%20/expression_console_userguide.pdf> ). Data was analyzed using the nonparametric Wilcoxen Rank Sum test. Fold changes are reported as ratios of medians. The P values were calculated individually for each probe set."
