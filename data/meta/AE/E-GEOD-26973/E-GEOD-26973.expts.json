Arabidopsis (Col-0 ecotype) plants were infiltrated with petiole exudate, with or without G3P, and distal leaves were sampled 24 h post treatments.  Keywords: Glycerol-3-Phosphate, Exudate, Salicylic acid, Arabidopsis, Systemic Acquired Resistance, Defense 3 mock-treated and 3 G3P-treated biological replicates were analyzed (one array each) Total RNA was isolated from four-week-old plants using TRIZOL method.  The experiment was carried out in triplicate and a separate group of plants was used for each set. RNA was processed and hybridized to the Affymetric Arabidopsis ATH1 genome array GeneChip following the manufacturers instructions (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.affymetrix.com\/Auth\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.affymetrix.com\/Auth\/<\/a>  support\/downloads\/manuals\/expression_analysis_technical_manual.pdf <<a href=\"http:\/\/www.affymetrix.com\/Auth\/%20support\/downloads\/manuals\/expression_analysis_technical_manual.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.affymetrix.com\/Auth\/%20support\/downloads\/manuals\/expression_analysis_technical_manual.pdf<\/a>> ).
