Investigation Title	Transcriptome profiling of LecRKVI.2 over-expressor plants.								
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome profiling of LecRKVI.2 over-expressor plants.								
Experiment Description	The arabidopsis L-type lectin receptor kinase-VI.2 positively regulates bacterial PAMP-triggered immunity. We used microarrays and performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis of LecRKVI.2 over-expressing plants and identified number of upregulated genes involved against bacterial resistance. Total RNA was isolated from 5-week-old Arabidopsis plants for RNA extraction and hybridisation on Affymetrix microarrays.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br	VALUE = RMA signal	Eleven ug of labelled samples were hybridised to the GeneChip Arabidopsis ATHI at 45ºC for 16.5 hours. Washing and staining were performed using the Fluidic Station-450.	Arabidopsis thaliana (L. Heyhn.) Columbia (Col-0) were grown in commercial potting soil/perlite (3:2) at 22-24�C day, 17-19�C night temperature under a 15-h-light/9-h-dark photoperiod.	The data were analysed using GeneSpring GX11 software and alogrithm RMA as normalisation method.	GeneChip were scanned with Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 7G.	no treatment	Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturers instructions.	Ten ug of total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis, labeled by in vitro transcription followed by fragmentation according to the manufacturer’s suggestion (GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual rev5, Affymetrix).
