However, this observation was based on an RNA gel blot analysis and therefore limited to few genes. Aim: To investigate whether plants with decreased ethylene perception are generally hypersensitive to GA or whether this effect is restricted to specific genes. We plan to undertake a complete transcriptome analysis of GA-treated wild type andetr1-1 plants. The aim is to identify genes that are induced directly as a result of the GA treatment, and we will therefore focus on the time window 0-3h.  Tissues to be sampled: Plants will be grown in vitroon MS\/2 containing 1% sucrose, pH 5.7, at 22 C,70% RH, under white light (54 PAR) and a photoperiod of 16h light\/8h dark. Plants will be treated at 14 days and harvested entirely, i.e. roots and shoots are extracted together.  Experimental set-up: Col-0 and the ethylene-insensitive mutant etr1-1 will be sprayed with 50 microM GA4 in water. GA4 is the major bio-active GA in Arabidopsis. Samples will be taken after 0, 30 min, 1h, and 3h. In order to correct for touch-induced genes a control, which is sprayed with water only and harvested at 1h, will be included for both genotypes. The total number of chips to be hybridized is 10. The time course with 4 data points is preferred to a single time point with 3 repeats, because it will allow us to follow the induction kinetics and identify early response genes. For each timepoint, RNA will be extracted from at least 40 individuals."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Liesbeth De Grauwe","role":"submitter investigator biosource_provider","email":"dominique.vanderstraeten@rug.ac.be"},{"contact":"unknown unknown","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19728874,"authors":"Osnat Atias, Benny Chor, Daniel A Chamovitz","title":"Large-scale analysis of Arabidopsis transcription reveals a basal co-regulation network","doi":"10.1186\/1752-0509-3-86","issue":3,"publication":"BMC Systems Biology","volume":86,"year":2009}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["14 days"]},{"category":"CellLine","value":["NASC_N1092","NASC_N237"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia","Columbia-0"]},{"category":"InitialTimePoint","value":["sowing"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPa","value":["whole_organism"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["whole_organism"]},{"category":"StrainOrLine","value":["  ","etr1-1"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":479069,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:489"},{"id":210476,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:490"},{"id":479068,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:488"},{"id":478991,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:487"},{"id":210465,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:486"},{"id":210480,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:485"},{"id":90396,"accession":"NASCLabelProtocol:1"},{"id":90407,"accession":"NASCExtractProtocol:1"},{"id":210481,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:931"},{"id":210467,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:934"},{"id":210478,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:935"},{"id":210474,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:932"},{"id":210473,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:933"},{"id":143,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4"},{"id":210469,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:493"},{"id":210471,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:492"},{"id":210475,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:491"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"},{"id":479080,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:937"},{"id":479081,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:938"},{"id":479078,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:935"},{"id":479079,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:936"},{"id":479076,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:933"},{"id":479077,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:934"},{"id":479074,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:931"},{"id":479075,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:932"},{"id":20050,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Percentile"},{"id":479082,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:939"},{"id":210479,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:489"},{"id":210477,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:937"},{"id":210472,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:488"},{"id":210470,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:936"},{"id":210468,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:939"},{"id":210482,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:938"},{"id":479072,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:492"},{"id":479073,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:493"},{"id":479070,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:490"},{"id":479071,"accession":"NASCSampleTreatmentProt:491"},{"id":478989,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:485"},{"id":210466,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:487"},{"id":478990,"accession":"NASCGrowProt:486"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
