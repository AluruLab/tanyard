Experiment Description	We have demonstrated that ethylene-insensitive mutants and wild type(Col-0) Arabidopsis plants treated with an ethylene perception inhibitor have increased levels of expression of genes, such as GASA1 and g-TIP, that are thought to be regulated by GA (Vriezen et al, unpublished results). However, this observation was based on an RNA gel blot analysis and therefore limited to few genes. Aim: To investigate whether plants with decreased ethylene perception are generally hypersensitive to GA or whether this effect is restricted to specific genes. We plan to undertake a complete transcriptome analysis of GA-treated wild type andetr1-1 plants. The aim is to identify genes that are induced directly as a result of the GA treatment, and we will therefore focus on the time window 0-3h.  Tissues to be sampled: Plants will be grown in vitroon MS/2 containing 1% sucrose, pH 5.7, at 22 C,70% RH, under white light (54 PAR) and a photoperiod of 16h light/8h dark. Plants will be treated at 14 days and harvested entirely, i.e. roots and shoots are extracted together.  Experimental set-up: Col-0 and the ethylene-insensitive mutant etr1-1 will be sprayed with 50 microM GA4 in water. GA4 is the major bio-active GA in Arabidopsis. Samples will be taken after 0, 30 min, 1h, and 3h. In order to correct for touch-induced genes a control, which is sprayed with water only and harvested at 1h, will be included for both genotypes. The total number of chips to be hybridized is 10. The time course with 4 data points is preferred to a single time point with 3 repeats, because it will allow us to follow the induction kinetics and identify early response genes. For each timepoint, RNA will be extracted from at least 40 individuals.

Protocol Description			This plant was sprayed with water and harvested 1hour after treatment. 	This plant was sprayed with water and immediately harvested. 															Protocol: Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol 	RNA samples were quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 100 pmol T7-(dT)24 primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3')  was hybridized with the Total RNA ( 8 - 12ug) at 70ÃÂ°C for 10 minutes.  First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM ÃÂ-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.
