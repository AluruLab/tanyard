Comment[Submitted Name]	The Arabidopsis thaliana map65-3 and ugt76b1 mutant transcriptomes upon the compatible interaction with Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis
Experiment Description	We used Arabidopsis full-genome microarrays to characterize plant transcript accumulations in map65-3 and ugt76b1 mutants, 3 days after water treatment and inoculation with the biotrophic oomycete downy mildew pathogen, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) In two independent experiments, cotyledons from the wild-type Wassilewskija (WS) ecotype, and from the map65-3 and ugt76b1 mutants were treated with water, or inoculated with the Hpa isolate Emwa1 to establish a compatible interaction. Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays were used to profile Arabidopsis transcript accumulations at 3 days after onset of treatment. Data from the water-treated and Hpa-infected wild-type were previously deposited as GSM914964, GSM914965, GSM914966, and GSM914967. The wild-type data, and the data from the map65-3 and ugt76b1 mutant presented here were established in the same set of experiments and analyses, which also involved the previously deposited pskr1-5 mutant (GSM914968, GSM914969, GSM914970, and GSM914971).

Protocol Description	Background adjustment, quantile normalization, and summarization of raw data were performed with the Affymetrix Power Tools APT1.14.4 software package. ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA log2 Signal intensity	Operated by the NASC's International Affymetrix Service	standard Affymetrix protocol	Operated by the NASC's International Affymetrix Service	standard Affymetrix protocol	For infection, 10-day-old plants were spray-inoculated to saturation with a spore suspension of 40,000 spores/ml (strain Emwa1)	A. thaliana seeds were sown on a soil/sand mixture, stratified for 3 days at 4 °C, and then grown under a 12 h photoperiod in a growth chamber at 20 °C.	Seeds from A. thaliana ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) were sown on a soil/sand mixture, stratified for 3 days at 4 °C, and then grown under a 12 h photoperiod in a growth chamber at 20 °C.	In two independent experiments for each line, cotyledons were treated with water, or inoculated with Hpa to establish a compatible interaction. Total RNA was extracted from about 100 mg of these tissues according to a procedure described (Laroche-Raynal et al., Plant Science Letters 35, 139-146,1984).	In two independent experiments, cotyledons from the ecotype Wassilewskija (Ws-4) wild-type or pskr1-5 mutant plants were treated with water, or inoculated with H. arabidopsidis to establish a compatible interaction. Total RNA was extracted from about 100 mg of these tissues according to a procedure described (Laroche-Raynal et al., Plant Science Letters 35, 139-146,1984).
