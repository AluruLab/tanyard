Protocol Description	"The Columbia (Col-0) ecotype of Arabidopsis thaliana was used as wild type. lbd16, lbd18 single and lbd16 lbd18 double mutants were used as mutants. The plants were grown for 12 days under long-day conditions (16h light/ 8h dark) on the Â½ Murashige Skoog(MS) medium containing vitamins, 1.5% sucrose, 2.5 mM Mes, pH 5.7, and 0.8% agar."	"Each RNA sample is obtained from seedlings of Arabidopsis. The frozen plant tissue (~100 mg) was ground in tiny mortars dipped in liquid nitrogen. The frozen powder was carefully transfered into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes using small funnels and rubber spatulas also cooled with liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions and purified with an RNeasy minelute cleanup kit (Qiagen)."	Equal amounts of RNA from triplicate samples were pooled.	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 		Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
