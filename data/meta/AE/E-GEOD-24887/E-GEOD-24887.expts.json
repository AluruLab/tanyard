Defects in cell division were seen as early as the globular stage in the strong loss-of-function allele dcl1-15.  Phenotypic work with dcl1-15 and the null allele dcl1-5 suggested that, in addition to the severe patterning defects, the mutants were maturing earlier than wild-type embryos. We performed global gene expression analysis of dcl1-15 and wild-type torpedo staged embryos to examine this maturation phenotype further.  The results suggested that DCL1 is a heterochronic gene.  Comparisons to a time series of embryo development (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.seedgenenetwork.net\/arabidopsis\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.seedgenenetwork.net\/arabidopsis<\/a>) showed that the genes differentially expressed in dcl1-15 embryos behaved more like green-cotyledon stage embryos than torpedo embryos. Seeds of a DCL1\/dcl1-15 plant were sown.  For each wild-type sample, 300 torpedo stage embryos were selected from wild-type siblings.  For each mutant replicate, 300 dcl1-15\/dcl1-15 embryos were selected from the siliques of DCL1\/dcl1-15 where the wild-type embryos were at the torpedo stage."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Matthew R Willmann","role":"submitter","email":"willmann@sas.upenn.edu"},{"contact":"Pablo D Jenik","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Matthew R Willmann","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21330492,"authors":"Willmann MR, Mehalick AJ, Packer RL, Jenik PD.","title":"MicroRNAs regulate the timing of embryo maturation in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1104\/pp.110.171355"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["plant embryo cotyledonary stage"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["dcl1-15 mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["dcl1-15 mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1198742,"accession":"P-GSE24887-5"},{"id":1198741,"accession":"P-GSE24887-6"},{"id":1198745,"accession":"P-GSE24887-3"},{"id":1198743,"accession":"P-GSE24887-4"},{"id":1198740,"accession":"P-GSE24887-7"},{"id":1198739,"accession":"P-GSE24887-8"},{"id":1198744,"accession":"P-GSE24887-2"},{"id":1198738,"accession":"P-GSE24887-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
