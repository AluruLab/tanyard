GSM1436792 1	Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface sterilized with 95% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min and 20% (v/v) bleach for 12 min. After 5 times rinsing with sterile water, seeds were imbibed and stratified at 4°C for 3 days before being sown on Petri dishes containing sterile ½ Murashige and Skoog mediums (0.5X MS salts, 0.8% sucrose, 0.5g/L MES, pH 5.7 and 1% agar). Seeds were germinated on vertically positioned Petri dishes in a growth chamber with continuous light at a temperature of 21ºC. Three-days-old Col-0 and ibr1ibr3ibr10 seedlings (five days post-imbibition) were transferred from ½ MS medium to a fresh ½ MS medium supplemented with or without 10 μM indole-3-buytric acid (IBA) for 6 hours. Then, root tip segments (~4mm) were dissected from the primary root and harvested for further RNA extraction. For each treatment, at least 120 individual Col-0 or ibr1ibr3ibr10 mutant root tip segments were sampled and three independent biological replicates were performed. Hormone and DMSO solution were filer-sterilized before being added to the medium.

GSM1436785 1	Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface sterilized with 95% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min and 20% (v/v) bleach for 12 min. After 5 times rinsing with sterile water, seeds were imbibed and stratified at 4°C for 3 days before being sown on Petri dishes containing sterile ½ Murashige and Skoog mediums (0.5X MS salts, 0.8% sucrose, 0.5g/L MES, pH 5.7 and 1% agar). Seeds were germinated on vertically positioned Petri dishes in a growth chamber with continuous light at a temperature of 21ºC. Three-days-old Col-0 and ibr1ibr3ibr10 seedlings (five days post-imbibition) were transferred from ½ MS medium to a fresh ½ MS medium supplemented with or without 10 μM indole-3-buytric acid (IBA) for 6 hours. Then, root tip segments (~4mm) were dissected from the primary root and harvested for further RNA extraction. For each treatment, at least 120 individual Col-0 or ibr1ibr3ibr10 mutant root tip segments were sampled and three independent biological replicates were performed. Hormone and DMSO solution were filer-sterilized before being added to the medium.
