Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis wild type and ibr1 ibr3 ibr10 triple mutant seedlings root tip segments treated with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)									
Experiment Description	The root cap-specific conversion of the auxin precursor indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) into the main auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) generates a local auxin source which subsequently modulates both the periodicity and intensity of auxin response oscillations in the root tip of Arabidopsis, and consequently fine-tunes the spatiotemporal patterning of lateral roots. To explore downstream components of this signaling process, we investigated the early transcriptional regulations happening in the root tip during IBA-to-IAA conversion in Col-0 and ibr1 ibr3 ibr10 triple mutant after 6 hours of IBA treatment. Arabidopsis thaliana (L). Heynh., Col-0 and ibr1ibr3ibr10 seeds were germinated vertically on solid medium derived from standard Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. Three days after germination, Col-0 and ibr1ibr3ibr10 seedlings were transferred to a fresh MS medium supplemented with or without 10 μM indole-3-buytric acid (IBA) for 6 hours. Then, root tip segments (~4mm) were dissected from the primary root and harvested for further RNA extraction. For each treatment, at least 120 individual Col-0 or ibr1ibr3ibr10 mutant root tip segments were sampled and three independent biological replicates were performed. Hormone and DMSO solution were filer-sterilized before being added to the medium.

Protocol Description	Data were normalized using RMA as implemented in the Affy package (version 1.40.0) of Bioconductor. Expression values are represented on a log2-scale. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 RMA	RNA concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically using the Nanodrop ND-1000 (Nanodrop Technologies) and RNA integrity was assessed using a Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent). Per sample, an amount of 100 ng of total RNA spiked with bacterial RNA transcript positive controls (Affymetrix) was amplified and labeled using the GeneChip 3' IVT express kit (Affymetrix). All steps were carried out according to the manufacturers protocol (Affymetrix).	A mixture of purified and fragmented biotinylated aRNA and hybridisation controls (Affymetrix) was hybridised on Affymetrix' Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome arrays followed by staining and washing in a GeneChip® fluidics station 450 (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s procedures.	Three-days-old Col-0 seedlings (five days post-imbibition) were transferred from ½ MS medium to a fresh ½ MS medium for 6 hours. Then, root tip segments (~4mm) were dissected from the primary root and harvested for further RNA extraction.	Three-days-old ibr1ibr3ibr10 seedlings (five days post-imbibition) were transferred from ½ MS medium to a fresh ½ MS medium supplemented with 10 μM indole-3-buytric acid (IBA) for 6 hours. Then, root tip segments (~4mm) were dissected from the primary root and harvested for further RNA extraction.	Three-days-old ibr1ibr3ibr10 seedlings (five days post-imbibition) were transferred from ½ MS medium to a fresh ½ MS medium for 6 hours. Then, root tip segments (~4mm) were dissected from the primary root and harvested for further RNA extraction.	Three-days-old Col-0 (five days post-imbibition) were transferred from ½ MS medium to a fresh ½ MS medium supplemented with 10 μM indole-3-buytric acid (IBA) for 6 hours. Then, root tip segments (~4mm) were dissected from the primary root and harvested for further RNA extraction.	Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface sterilized with 95% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min and 20% (v/v) bleach for 12 min. After 5 times rinsing with sterile water, seeds were imbibed and stratified at 4°C for 3 days before being sown on Petri dishes containing sterile ½ Murashige and Skoog mediums (0.5X MS salts, 0.8% sucrose, 0.5g/L MES, pH 5.7 and 1% agar). Seeds were germinated on vertically positioned Petri dishes in a growth chamber with continuous light at a temperature of 21ºC.	The material was extracted using the Rneasy® Plant Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions	To assess the raw probe signal intensities, chips were scanned using a GeneChip® scanner 3000 (Affymetrix).
