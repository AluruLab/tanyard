To explore downstream components of this signaling process, we investigated the early transcriptional regulations happening in the root tip during IBA-to-IAA conversion in Col-0 and ibr1 ibr3 ibr10 triple mutant after 6 hours of IBA treatment. Arabidopsis thaliana (L). Heynh., Col-0 and ibr1ibr3ibr10 seeds were germinated vertically on solid medium derived from standard Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. Three days after germination, Col-0 and ibr1ibr3ibr10 seedlings were transferred to a fresh MS medium supplemented with or without 10 μM indole-3-buytric acid (IBA) for 6 hours. Then, root tip segments (~4mm) were dissected from the primary root and harvested for further RNA extraction. For each treatment, at least 120 individual Col-0 or ibr1ibr3ibr10 mutant root tip segments were sampled and three independent biological replicates were performed. Hormone and DMSO solution were filer-sterilized before being added to the medium."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Boris Parizot","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Wei Xuan","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Tom Beeckman","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Wouter Van Delm","role":"submitter","email":"Nucleomics.Bioinformatics@vib.be"},{"contact":"Dominique Audenaert","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":25959963,"authors":"Xuan W, Audenaert D, Parizot B, Möller BK, Njo MF, De Rybel B, De Rop G, Van Isterdael G, Mähönen AP, Vanneste S, Beeckman T","title":"Root Cap-Derived Auxin Pre-patterns the Longitudinal Axis of the Arabidopsis Root.","doi":"10.1016\/j.cub.2015.03.046"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["3 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["ibr1ibr3ibr10","wild type"]},{"category":"initial time point","value":["germination"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root tip"]},{"category":"provider","value":["Wei Xuan, Dominique Audenaert, Tom Beeckman, VIB Department of Plant Systems Biology, Ghent University, Technologiepark 927, 9052 Gent, BELGIUM"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["DMSO","indole-3-butyric acid"]},{"name":"dose","value":["10 micromolar"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["ibr1ibr3ibr10","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1172748,"accession":"P-GSE59426-9"},{"id":1172747,"accession":"P-GSE59426-8"},{"id":1172743,"accession":"P-GSE59426-5"},{"id":1172744,"accession":"P-GSE59426-4"},{"id":1172741,"accession":"P-GSE59426-7"},{"id":1172742,"accession":"P-GSE59426-6"},{"id":1172749,"accession":"P-GSE59426-2"},{"id":1172746,"accession":"P-GSE59426-3"},{"id":1172745,"accession":"P-GSE59426-10"},{"id":1172740,"accession":"P-GSE59426-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
