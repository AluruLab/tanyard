Vitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5â€²-phosphate) is an essential cofactor of many metabolic enzymes. Plants biosynthesize the vitamin de novo employing two enzymes, pyridoxine synthase1 (PDX1) and PDX2. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), there are two catalytically active paralogs of PDX1 (PDX1.1 and PDX1.3) producing the vitamin at comparable rates. Since single mutants are viable but the pdx1.1 pdx1.3 double mutant is lethal, the corresponding enzymes seem redundant. However, the single mutants exhibit substantial phenotypic differences, particularly at the level of root development, with pdx1.3 being more impaired than pdx1.1. Here, we investigate the impact of possible global changes in gene expression in the pdx1.3 mutant compared to WT on the phenotype. Four different types of samples (conditions) were analyzed, namely pdx1.3 leaves, pdx1.3 roots, WT leaves and WT roots with three biological replicates per condition (12 samples altogether). WT samples served as reference (control) for the respective pdx1.3 samples."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Teresa Fitzpatrick","role":"submitter","email":"theresa.fitzpatrick@unige.ch"},{"contact":"Svetlana Boycheva","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Teresa B Fitzpatrick","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":25475669,"authors":"Boycheva S, Dominguez A, Rolcik J, Boller T, Fitzpatrick TB","title":"Consequences of a deficit in vitamin B6 biosynthesis de novo for hormone homeostasis and root development in Arabidopsis."}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["10 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["pdx1.3 knockout","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf","root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["pdx1.3 knockout","wild type"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["leaf","root"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1161066,"accession":"P-GSE71312-2"},{"id":1161065,"accession":"P-GSE71312-3"},{"id":1161064,"accession":"P-GSE71312-4"},{"id":1161063,"accession":"P-GSE71312-5"},{"id":1161060,"accession":"P-GSE71312-1"},{"id":1161062,"accession":"P-GSE71312-6"},{"id":1161061,"accession":"P-GSE71312-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
