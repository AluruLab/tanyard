Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from WT Col-0 and the pdx1.3 ko mutant of Arabidopsis						
Experiment Description	We performed a microarray experiment to assess the global changes in transcription occurring in leaves and roots of the vitamin B6 deficient pdx1.3 knockout mutant in comparison to WT. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5â€²-phosphate) is an essential cofactor of many metabolic enzymes. Plants biosynthesize the vitamin de novo employing two enzymes, pyridoxine synthase1 (PDX1) and PDX2. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), there are two catalytically active paralogs of PDX1 (PDX1.1 and PDX1.3) producing the vitamin at comparable rates. Since single mutants are viable but the pdx1.1 pdx1.3 double mutant is lethal, the corresponding enzymes seem redundant. However, the single mutants exhibit substantial phenotypic differences, particularly at the level of root development, with pdx1.3 being more impaired than pdx1.1. Here, we investigate the impact of possible global changes in gene expression in the pdx1.3 mutant compared to WT on the phenotype. Four different types of samples (conditions) were analyzed, namely pdx1.3 leaves, pdx1.3 roots, WT leaves and WT roots with three biological replicates per condition (12 samples altogether). WT samples served as reference (control) for the respective pdx1.3 samples.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed using MAS 5.0 (Microarray Suite version 5.0) with in its analysis software (GCOS = GeneChip Operating System). The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100. ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity ABS_CALL =  DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Biotinylated cRNA samples were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 500 ng total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 16 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome Array GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Leaves and roots were harvested separately, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a freezer (-80C) till further processing.	Plants were grown on half strength Murashige-Skoog medium, containing 1% sucrose, without vitamin B6, at long day conditions (16 h light/8 h darkness; 120 uM light; 22C/18C day/night temparture) for 10 days after germination.	Total RNA extraction was performed using a NucleoSpin RNA Plant extraction kit from Macherey Nagel according to the manufacturer's instructions.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.
