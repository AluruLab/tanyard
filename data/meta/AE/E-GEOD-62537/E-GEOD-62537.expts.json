Arabidopsis Col-0 and ndr1-1 seeds were grown in petri dishes with liquid MS medium supplemented with 0.2% sucrose. After two weeks on a horizontal shaker (40 rpm), plants were rinsed twice in sterile distilled water and transferred to liquid 0.5xMS medium without sucrose, supplemented with 200 conidia ml-1 of V. longisporum isolate VL1 (CBS110220). Control plants were grown in 0.5x MS only. At 48 hours post inoculation, materials were harvested in biological replicates (>50 plant roots) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted with Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit (Bio-Rad) and hybridized to the Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array at the DNAVision facility (Gosselies, Belgium). Microarray assays were performed with triplicate biological root samples. Normalization of the microarray data was performed using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method as implemented by the “quantile normalization” function in the Bioconductor 1.3 software."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Jonas Roos","role":"submitter","email":"Jonas.Roos@slu.se"},{"contact":"Christina Dixelius","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Sarosh Bejai","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jonas Roos","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":25640950,"authors":"J Roos, S Bejai, R Mozūraitis, C Dixelius","title":"Susceptibility to Verticillium longisporum is linked to monoterpene production by TPS23\/27 in Arabidopsis","doi":"10.1111\/tpj.12752"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["16 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["defense signaling mutant ndr1-1","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["defense signaling mutant ndr1-1","wild type"]},{"name":"infect","value":["mock","Verticillium longisporum isolate VL1 (CBS110220)"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1174256,"accession":"P-GSE62537-7"},{"id":1174259,"accession":"P-GSE62537-4"},{"id":1174260,"accession":"P-GSE62537-3"},{"id":1174257,"accession":"P-GSE62537-6"},{"id":1174258,"accession":"P-GSE62537-5"},{"id":1174261,"accession":"P-GSE62537-2"},{"id":1174255,"accession":"P-GSE62537-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
