Plants were grown in Conviron growth chambers in 20- x 40-cm nursery flats at a photosynthetic photon flux density of 200 mmol m-2 s-1 and a 16-h photoperiod. The temperature in the chambers was 23°C and the relative humidity was 50%. Plants were grown for 3 weeks and used in experiments before flowering.","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":447058,"accession":"P-GSE18960-3","name":"P-GSE18960-3","text":"Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol","type":"nucleic_acid_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":447056,"accession":"P-GSE18960-4","name":"P-GSE18960-4","text":"Labelled using protocol described in Affymetrix manual \"3' IVT Express Kit User Manual\"","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":447060,"accession":"P-GSE18960-5","name":"P-GSE18960-5","text":"Biotin Labelled cRNA using \"Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit\", according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA","type":"hybridization","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":447059,"accession":"P-GSE18960-6","name":"P-GSE18960-6","text":"Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.","type":"image_aquisition","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":447055,"accession":"P-GSE18960-7","name":"P-GSE18960-7","text":"Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm.
