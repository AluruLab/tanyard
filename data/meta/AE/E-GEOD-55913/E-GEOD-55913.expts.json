Plant organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplast also have their own RecA homologues. We focused on chloroplast RecA homologue RECA1 because it has been well known that the precursors of phytohormones and secondary metabolites related to plant defense responses are synthesized in chloroplast and recent studies have identified several chloroplastic proteins invoved with plant defense responses. We used microarrays to investigate the global gene expression changes by RECA1 and identified the up-regualted genes involved with plant defense response. 2-week-old Col-0 and RECA1(at1g79050)-overexpressing plants without any treatments were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Col-0 plants were used as control and T3 RECA1-overexpressing transgenic plants were used in this study."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Hyesung Jeon","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Hyesung Jeon","role":"submitter","email":"purda78@snu.ac.kr"},{"contact":"Minkyun Kim","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["RECA1 overexpression","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedlings"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["RECA1 overexpression","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1091117,"accession":"P-GSE55913-7"},{"id":1091119,"accession":"P-GSE55913-5"},{"id":1091118,"accession":"P-GSE55913-6"},{"id":1091120,"accession":"P-GSE55913-3"},{"id":1091122,"accession":"P-GSE55913-4"},{"id":1091116,"accession":"P-GSE55913-1"},{"id":1091121,"accession":"P-GSE55913-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0}]}]}}
