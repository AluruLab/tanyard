In particular, application of inhibitors of cellulose synthesis such as thaxtomin A (TA) and isoxaben (IXB) initiates a programmed cell death (PCD) in Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells that is dependent on de novo gene transcription. To further understand how TA and IXB activate PCD, a whole genome microarray analysis was performed on mRNA isolated from Arabidopsis suspension cells exposed to TA and IXB. More than 75% of the genes upregulated by TA were also upregulated by IXB, including genes encoding cell wall-related and calcium-binding proteins, defence\/stress-related transcription factors, signalling components and cell death-related proteins. Comparisons with published transcriptional analyses revealed an important subset of genes generally induced in response to various biotic and abiotic stress. Experiment Overall Design: TA,  IXB and methanol (control) were added to Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells three days after sub-culture. Cells were harvested for RNA isolation and frozen in liquid nitrogen after 6 hours of contact with the inhibitors. Samples consisted of four replicates for each condition.  A total of 12 Affymetrix GeneChipsÂ® were used in this study, which correspond to 12 RNA samples from the four biological replicates for each of the TA, IXB or methanol addition."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Nathalie Beaudoin","role":"submitter","email":"Nathalie.Beaudoin@usherbrooke.ca"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19198845,"authors":"Isabelle Duval, Nathalie Beaudoin","title":"Transcriptional profiling in response to inhibition of cellulose synthesis by thaxtomin A and isoxaben in Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"cell type","value":["suspension culture"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Landsberg erecta"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["isoxaben","none","thaxtomin A"]},{"name":"dose","value":["100 nanomolar","2 micromolar"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":16,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1125341,"accession":"P-G17824-4"},{"id":1125343,"accession":"P-G17824-5"},{"id":1125346,"accession":"P-G17824-2"},{"id":1125342,"accession":"P-G17824-3"},{"id":1125344,"accession":"P-G17824-6"},{"id":1125340,"accession":"P-G17824-7"},{"id":1125345,"accession":"P-G17824-1"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
