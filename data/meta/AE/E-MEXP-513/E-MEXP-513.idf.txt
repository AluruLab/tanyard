Experiment Description	Wild type and transgenic msi1-tap1 plants were grown and gene expression was compared at two time points at the age of 8 days.

Protocol Type	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	pool	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation	
Protocol Description	Seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (accession Columbia) were grown on MS medium for 8 days in growth chambers at 21 C under long day photoperiods (16 h light, 8 h darkness). The entire experiment was performed twice providing independent biological replicates. Samples were compared at 4 h and 21 h from the beginning of the light period.	RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturers protocol followed by a clean-up on Quiagen RNeasy columns.	Seedlings were pooled from 3 individual plates for each replicate.
