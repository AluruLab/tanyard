Investigation Title	Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana PHR1 primary targets genes under phosphate starvation stress							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana PHR1 primary targets genes under phosphate starvation stress							
Experiment Description	We performed a transcriptomic analysis of Pi starvation responses in Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0) phr1 mutant plants expressing PHR1 in presence of cicloheximide, that inhibit protein translation, thus preventing any effect of PHR1 on the expression of indirect targets. Results show the primary target genes of PHR1 in the responses to Pi starvation. The analysis was performed in phr1 plants and phr1 plants overexpressing a fusion GR:PHR1 (OXGR:PHR1) whose activity is postranslationally controlled by dexamethasone (DEX), that allows studying gene expression upon PHR1 activation and the concomitant inhibition of translation with cycloheximide (CHX), thus preventing any effect of PHR1 on the expression of indirect targets. To perform this study, phr1 and OXGR:PHR1 phr1 plants were grown for seven days in complete Johnson liquid media (+Pi), 2 days in Pi-lacking media (-Pi) and then supplemented with 5 µM DEX and 10 µM CHX for 6 hours before harvesting. Three independent biological samples of total RNA from shoot and root were hybridized separately.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA log Signal intensity	10µg of fragmented cRNA were hybridized to the Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome array (Affymetrix, SantaClara, CA), containing 22500 transcript variants from 24000 well -characterized Arabidopsis thaliana genes. Each sample was added to a hybridization solution containing 100mM2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, 1M Na+,and 20mM of EDTA in the presence of 0.01% of Tween-20 to a final cRNA concentration of 0.05µg/ml. Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 45ºC . Each microarray was washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin in a Fluidics station 450 (Affymetrix)	Plants were grown for 7 days in liquid Johnson medium containing 2% sucrose and 2mM phosphate (KH2PO4), 2 days in phosphate-lacking medium (-Pi) and then supplemented with 5 µM dexamethasone (DEX) and 10 µM cycloheximide (CHX) for 6 hours before harvesting.	Analysis was performed using the affylmaGUI R package (Wettenhall et al, 2006). Robust Muti-array Analysis (RMA) algorithm was used for background correction, normalization and expression levels summarization (Irizarry et al., 2003).	Each microarray was scanned at 2.5 µm resolution in a GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G System (Affymetrix)	5 µM dexamethasone (DEX) and 10 µM cycloheximide (CHX) for 6 hours in phosphate-lacking Johnson liquid medium.	The RNA from complete plants was isolated using RNeasy plant mini kit from Quiagen	Each RNA preparation was tested for degradation using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent technologies, Palo Alto, CA). cDNA was synthesized from 4 µg of total RNA using One-cycle target labeling and control reagents(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) to produce biotin-labeled cRNA. The cRNA preparations (15 µg) were fragmented at 94ºC for 35 min into 35-200 bases in length.
