Results show the primary target genes of PHR1 in the responses to Pi starvation. The analysis was performed in phr1 plants and phr1 plants overexpressing a fusion GR:PHR1 (OXGR:PHR1) whose activity is postranslationally controlled by dexamethasone (DEX), that allows studying gene expression upon PHR1 activation and the concomitant inhibition of translation with cycloheximide (CHX), thus preventing any effect of PHR1 on the expression of indirect targets. To perform this study, phr1 and OXGR:PHR1 phr1 plants were grown for seven days in complete Johnson liquid media (+Pi), 2 days in Pi-lacking media (-Pi) and then supplemented with 5 µM DEX and 10 µM CHX for 6 hours before harvesting. Three independent biological samples of total RNA from shoot and root were hybridized separately."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Javier Paz-Ares","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Gabriel Castrillo","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Regla Bustos","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20838596,"authors":"Bustos R, Castrillo G, Linhares F, Puga MI, Rubio V, Pérez-Pérez J, Solano R, Leyva A, Paz-Ares J","title":"A central regulatory system largely controls transcriptional activation and repression responses to phosphate starvation in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.1001102","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["OXGR:PHR1; phr1 mutant","phr1 mutant"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["OXGR:PHR1; phr1 mutant","phr1 mutant"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":446428,"accession":"P-GSE20955-3"},{"id":446425,"accession":"P-GSE20955-4"},{"id":446423,"accession":"P-GSE20955-1"},{"id":446429,"accession":"P-GSE20955-2"},{"id":446426,"accession":"P-GSE20955-7"},{"id":446430,"accession":"P-GSE20955-8"},{"id":446424,"accession":"P-GSE20955-5"},{"id":446427,"accession":"P-GSE20955-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
