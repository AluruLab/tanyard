Comment[Submitted Name]	The SHR/SCR pathway directly activates genes involved in asymmetric cell division in the Arabidopsis root							
Experiment Description	Asymmetric division of cortex/endodermal initials (CEI) in the Arabidopsis root generates two layers of ground tissue and is controlled by a finely orchestrated interplay between the transcription factors, SHORT ROOT (SHR) and SCARECROW (SCR).  To understand the dynamics of the SHR/SCR regulatory network we performed microarray time course experiments using inducible versions of SHR and SCR and examined their transcriptional effects specifically in the ground tissue.  Keywords: SHR and SCR time course and CEI cell-type analyses We performed a time course analysis (TC data set) of the ground tissue (sorted J0571 enancher trap) after transfer either SHR or SCR inducible plants to Dex containing plates 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours. We sorted for CEI cells using the pCYCD6::GFP marker line.  Seedlings were grown for 5 days. SHR and SCR inducible plants were transfer to 1microM Dex MS plates. J0571 and CYCD6 sorted fluorecent cells were harvested for RNA extraction.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Signal<br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Samples were submitted to Duke Microarray Facility (Durham, NC) for hybridization to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.	Seeds were surface sterilized for 2 minutes in 70% ethanol, the ethanol was removed, then replaced with 30% Bleach and 0.02% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes. Seeds were rinsed 3 times with sterile water, stratified at 4ËšC for 2 days, then placed on standard media. Standard media is 1X Murashige and Skoog salt mixture, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH.  Dex media is 1X Murashige and Skoog salt mixture in which 1micromolar of Dex is added. Nylon mesh was placed on top of the solidified media and seeds were planted at ~20 seeds/cm in two rows.	MAS 5.0	Samples were submitted to Duke Microarray Facility (Durham, NC) for hybridization to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.	Seedlings were grown for 5 days before transfer to Dex media.  Roots were cut with a razor blade 0.5 mm below the root/hypocotyl junction and collected into RNA extraction buffer.	Approximately 1000 roots were collected per replicate, with two biological replicates being performed per time point.  Samples were briefly sonicated to disrupt the tissue.  RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).	Fragmented cRNA probes were prepared using the two-cycle amplification protocol by Affymetrix.
