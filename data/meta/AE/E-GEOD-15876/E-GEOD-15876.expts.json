To understand the dynamics of the SHR\/SCR regulatory network we performed microarray time course experiments using inducible versions of SHR and SCR and examined their transcriptional effects specifically in the ground tissue.  Keywords: SHR and SCR time course and CEI cell-type analyses We performed a time course analysis (TC data set) of the ground tissue (sorted J0571 enancher trap) after transfer either SHR or SCR inducible plants to Dex containing plates 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours. We sorted for CEI cells using the pCYCD6::GFP marker line.  Seedlings were grown for 5 days. SHR and SCR inducible plants were transfer to 1microM Dex MS plates. J0571 and CYCD6 sorted fluorecent cells were harvested for RNA extraction."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Rosangela Sozzani","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Rosangela Sozzani","role":"submitter","email":"rs93@duke.edu"},{"contact":"Philip N Benfey","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20596025,"authors":"Sozzani R, Cui H, Moreno-Risueno MA, Busch W, Van Norman JM, Vernoux T, Brady SM, Dewitte W, Murray JA, Benfey PN","title":"Spatiotemporal regulation of cell-cycle genes by SHORTROOT links patterning and growth.","doi":"10.1038\/nature09143","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["5 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["pCYCD6::GFP","SCR inducible","SHR inducible"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND","value":["dexamethasone","none"]},{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["pCYCD6::GFP","SCR inducible","SHR inducible"]},{"name":"TREATMENT TIME","value":["0 hours","1 hours","12 hours","3 hours","6 hours","n\/a hours"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":23,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":449760,"accession":"P-GSE15876-6"},{"id":449761,"accession":"P-GSE15876-5"},{"id":449759,"accession":"P-GSE15876-8"},{"id":449758,"accession":"P-GSE15876-7"},{"id":449762,"accession":"P-GSE15876-2"},{"id":449757,"accession":"P-GSE15876-1"},{"id":449764,"accession":"P-GSE15876-4"},{"id":449763,"accession":"P-GSE15876-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":23,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":23,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":23,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":23,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":23,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":23,"isderived":0}]}]}}
