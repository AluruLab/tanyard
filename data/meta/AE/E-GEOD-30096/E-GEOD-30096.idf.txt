Investigation Title	Expression analysis of developmental stages of Arabidopsis roots exposed to low pH							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression analysis of developmental stages of Arabidopsis roots exposed to low pH							
Experiment Description	To understand the effect of low pH on developmental stages in the root, we dissected the root into four developmental zones after exposure to low pH and expression profiled each zone. Stress responses in plants are tightly coordinated with developmental processes, but the interaction between these pathways is poorly understood. Here we use genome-wide assays at high spatial and temporal resolution to understand the processes that lnk development and stress in the Arabidopsis root. Our meta-analysis finds little evidence for a universal stress response. Common stress responses appear to exists and, analagous to animal systems, many of them show cell-type specificity, suggesting a convergent evolutionary theme in multicellular organisms. Common stress responses may be mediated by cell identity regulators, as mutations in these genes resulted in altered responses to stress. Our results reveal surprising linkages between stress and development at cellular resolution, and show the power of multiple genome-wide datasets to elucidate biological processes. 2 replicates each of 4 developmental stages exposed to standard and low pH

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Signal<br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	hybs with fragmented cRNA were preformed by Expression Analysis (Durham, NC)	Seedlings were grown for 5 days on standard (pH 5.7) media before transfer either to standard or low pH (pH 4.6) media for 24 hours prior to dissection	CHP files contain MAS 5.0 probe set summarizations using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The mean target intensity of each array was set to 250.	scans were preformed by Expression Analysis (Durham, NC)	Seeds were surface sterilized with 50% Bleach and 0.1% Tween for 5 minutes and then rinsed 3 times with sterile water. Seeds were stratified at 4ËšC for 2 days before being planted on media containing 1X concentration Murashige and Skoog salt mixture (Caisson laboratories), 0.5g/L MES, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH. At 5 days, seedlings were transferred to standard pH (pH 5.7) or low pH (pH 4.6) media for 24 hours prior to dissection. Low pH media is 1X concentration Murashige and Skoog salt mixture (Caisson laboratories), 3mM DMG, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 4.6 with KOH. Standard pH is the same except pH is adjusted to 5.7.	Total RNA was extracted with Qiagen Rneasy Plant mini kit according to manufacturer's instructions	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard two-cycle Affymetrix protocol
