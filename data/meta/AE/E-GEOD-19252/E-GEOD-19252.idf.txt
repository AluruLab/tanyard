Investigation Title	Identification of AtATM-dependent X-ray inducible transcript						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Identification of AtATM-dependent X-ray inducible transcript						
Experiment Description	ATM plays an important role in the response of plants to forms of DNA damage that cause DNA double-strand breaks. Arabidopsis ATM has been shown to be important for the transcriptional induction of several DNA repair genes including AtRAD51 (Garcia et al 2003 Plant Cell 15, 119-132). In our experiment we compare the transcript profiles of wild type and mutant plants exposed to 10Gy X-rays (dose rate ~0.8 Gy/min). Plants will be grown on 0.5*MS + 1%sucrose at 22degC under short (9h) day conditions and treated after 5h light. We will irradiate wild type (Col-0) and atatm-3 mutant (N589805) seedlings at growth stage 1.06 and harvest tissue 1h post irradiation. RNA will be isolated using the SV RNA isolation kit (Promega). Comparison of the transcript profiles will then allow AtATM-dependent X-ray inducible transcripts to be identified. 6 samples (3 wild type, 3 mutant) were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	As per manufacturer's instructions	Overnight 4C in dark 10 minutes soaking in sterilisation solution (10 % (v/v) house hold bleach, 1 % (v/v) Triton X-100) followed by 5 repeat rinses of sd H2O. Seedlings grown on 0.5 x MS media containing 1 % phytoagar and 1 % sucrose in a growth room with the following conditions: 9/15 hrs light/dark, 22°C, 65 Ã‚ÂµEm-2s-1 Growth Room Phytagar Standard media autoclave Murashige and Skoog basal salt mixture.	Labelled using protocol described in manual &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual&quot;, One-Cycle target labelling	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
