Experiment Description	Shortly after the release of singlet oxygen (1O2), drastic changes in  nuclear gene expression occur in the conditional flu mutant of  Arabidopsis that reveal a rapid transfer of signals from the plastid  to the nucleus. In contrast to retrograde control of nuclear gene  expression by plastid signals described earlier, the primary effect  of 1O2 generation in the flu mutant is not the control of chloroplast  biogenesis but the activation of a broad range of signaling pathways  known to be involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses.  This activity of a plastid-derived signal suggests a new function of  the chloroplast, namely that of a sensor of environmental changes  that activates a broad range of stress responses. Inactivation of the  plastid protein EXECUTER1 attenuates the extent of 1O2-induced  up-regulation of nuclear gene expression, but it does not fully  eliminate these changes. A second related nuclear-encoded protein,  dubbed EXECUTER2, has been identified that is also implicated  with the signaling of 1O2-dependent nuclear gene expression  changes. Like EXECUTER1, EXECUTER2 is confined to the plastid.  Inactivation of both EXECUTER proteins in the ex1/ex2/flu triple  mutant is sufficient to suppress the up-regulation of almost all  1O2-responsive genes. Retrograde control of 1O2-responsive genes  requires the concerted action of both EXECUTER proteins within  the plastid compartment. Experiment Overall Design: Two individual biologica replicates, each containing material of five mature plants of wild  type, flu, ex1/flu, ex2/flu, and ex1/ex2/flu, respectively, were used for  the microarray analysis. Plants were germinated on soil and kept  under continuous light until the beginning of bolting and then  transferred to the dark for 8 h. Dark-incubated mature plants were  reilluminated for 30 min and subsequently harvested for RNA extraction. Experiment Overall Design: The EX1 (At4g33630) T-DNA insertion line SALK 002088 and EX2 (At1g27510) T-DNA insertion line  SALK 012127 were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock  Centre (NASC). Homozygous mutant lines were identified by PCR  analysis by using T-DNA-, EX1- and EX2-specific primers. Both  T-DNA-lines were crossed with a flu Col-0 line that had been  obtained by 5 backcrosses of flu1-1 in Landsberg erecta with  wild-type Columbia. The ex1/flu and ex2/flu mutant lines were  crossed, and within the segregating F2 population triple mutants  were identified by PCR-based genotyping. For the cultivation of mature plants, seeds of wild type, flu, ex1/flu, ex2/flu, and ex1/ex2/flu,  all in Col-0 ecotype, were sown on soil and plants were grown under  continuous light (100  mol m 2 s 1).

Protocol Description	dark to light transition	Two individual biological replicates, each containing material of five mature plants of wild  type, flu, ex1/flu, ex2/flu, and ex1/ex2/flu, respectively, were used for  the microarray analysis. Plants were germinated on soil and kept  under continuous light until the beginning of bolting and then  transferred to the dark for 8 h. Dark-incubated mature plants were  reilluminated for 30 min and subsequently harvested for RNA extraction.	Total RNA was extracted by using an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and  quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm.	Only those samples with a 260/280 nm ratio between 1.8-2.1 and a 28S/18S  ratio within 1.5-2 were further processed. Total RNA samples (5 mg) were reverse-transcribed into doublestranded  cDNA with a One-Cycle cDNA synthesis kit (P/N 900431; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The doublestranded  cDNA was purified using a Sample Cleanup Module (P/N 900371; Affymetrix). The purified doublestranded  cDNAs were in vitro-transcribed in the presence of biotin-labeled nucleotides using a IVT labeling kit  (P/N 900449; Affymetrix). The biotinylated c RNA was purified by using a Sample Cleanup Module (P/N  900371; Affymetrix), and its quality and quantity were determined with a NanoDrop ND 1000 and Bioanalyzer  2100.	Biotin-labeled cRNA samples (15 mg) were fragmented randomly to 35-200 bp at 94Â&deg;C in  fragmentation buffer (P/N 900371; Affymetrix) and were mixed in 300 ml of hybridization buffer containing a  hybridization control cRNA and control oligo B2 control (P/N 900454; Affymetrix), 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm  DNA, and 0.5 mg/ml acetylated BSA in 2-(4-morpholino)-ethane sulfonic acid (Mes) buffer, pH 6.7, before  hybridization to GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 genome arrays for 16 h at 45Â&deg;C. Arrays were then washed using  an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 EukGE-WS2v4_450 protocol. An Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 was  used to measure the fluorescence intensity emitted by the labeled target.	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
