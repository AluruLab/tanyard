Experiment Description	Transcript profiling analysis of AtFBP7 mutant seedlings compared to wild type using Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip array.	
Protocol Name	P-G3864-1	P-G3864-2	P-G3864-3	
Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	
Protocol Description	Approximately 80 mg from 5 day old light grown No-0 wild type seedlings were collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 80 mg from 5 day old light grown AtFBP7 mutant seedlings in Nossen background  AtFBP7  were collected and ground to a fine powder under liquid Nitrogen. Samples were lysed in separate groups in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 6 Ã‚&#956;g of total RNA was processed to produce biotinylated cRNA targets.
