Consequently, genes that mediate GABA response in plants remain unknown. We therefore used microarrays to survey the genome, identifying genes modulated in response to GABA in reproductive tissues.  Flowers were collected as described in the protocols section for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix ATH1 Genechip microarrays. Gene expression in wild-type and pop2-1 mutant flowers containing high levels of endogenous GABA were compared."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Ravishankar Palanivelu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Daphne Preuss","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"RAVISHANKAR PALANIVELU","role":"submitter","email":"rpalaniv@ag.arizona.edu"},{"contact":"Emily Updegraff","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"biosource provider","value":["Ravishankar Palanivelu"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["pollinated stage 14-15 flowers"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Ler"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["pop2-1 mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["flowers"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["pop2-1 mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1128048,"accession":"P-GSE21945-1"},{"id":1128053,"accession":"P-GSE21945-2"},{"id":1128055,"accession":"P-GSE21945-3"},{"id":1128054,"accession":"P-GSE21945-4"},{"id":1128052,"accession":"P-GSE21945-5"},{"id":1128051,"accession":"P-GSE21945-6"},{"id":1128050,"accession":"P-GSE21945-7"},{"id":1128049,"accession":"P-GSE21945-8"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
