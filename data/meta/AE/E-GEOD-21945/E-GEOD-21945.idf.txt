Experiment Description	"Although two genes responsive to GABA were characterized previously in plants (Kathiresan et al 1997), a comprehensive study in reproductive and vegetative tissues has not been performed. Consequently, genes that mediate GABA response in plants remain unknown. We therefore used microarrays to survey the genome, identifying genes modulated in response to GABA in reproductive tissues.  Flowers were collected as described in the protocols section for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix ATH1 Genechip microarrays. Gene expression in wild-type and pop2-1 mutant flowers containing high levels of endogenous GABA were compared."

Protocol Description	Stage 14-15 pollinated flowers from pop2-1/pop2-1 homozygous mutant plants were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen until RNA isolation.	"Total RNA was extracted from collected flowers using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (http://www.qiagen.com). Total RNA (10 Âµg) was prepared for microarray experiment as per the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis protocol (Part#701071, Rev 5, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)."	pop2-1 homozygous mutant plants (Ler accession) were grown in chambers at 21Â°C under illumination (100 Âµmol m-2 s-1 with a 16-hour photoperiod).	"After first and second strand cDNA synthesis with total RNA, the cDNAs were used to generate cRNA labeled with biotin in an in vitro transcription reaction."	"Labeled cRNA was fragmented and 15 Âµg of fragmented cRNA (25-200nt as per Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Nano Chip Series II Assay, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) was hybridized to the GeneChipÂ® Arabidopsis ATH1 genome arrays (http://www.affymetrix.com) for 20 hours at 45oC. Standard washing and staining procedures were performed using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)."	"The arrays were then scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 with 7G upgrade (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)."	"Signal intensities from each of the 15 arrays were converted to raw expression data (with Present, ""P"", Absent, ""A"" and Marginal, ""M"" scores) using Microarray Suite 5.0 (MAS 5.0; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)."	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = absent or present call by Affymetrix<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = statistical significance
