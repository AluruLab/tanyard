Protocol Description	Each chip was normalized relative to the sum of the signal values using the GeneChip software MAS version 5 (Affymetrix). 	Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with 5 mg/L tunicamycin for 5 h.	"Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturerï¾’s instructions. (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"	"The array was scanned using a confocal microscope scanner (HP Genome Array Scanner; Affymetrix) at a wavelength of 570 nm. (Parameters: Scanning hardware = HP GeneArray [Affymetrix/HP], Scanning software = MAS/GCOS/GREX [Affymetrix])"	"Each cRNA sample (20 ug) was fragmented and hybridized with the Arabidopsis Genome Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) for 16 h at 45C with rotation at 60 rpm. Each array was then washed and detected by consecutive exposure to phycoerythrin-streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), biotinylated antibodies to streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and phycoerythrin-streptavidin, after which each array was washed again with a nonstringent wash buffer. All washing and staining procedures were performed with a Fluidics Station 400 (Affymetrix). (Parameters: Chamber type = Affymetrix- GeneChip Hyb Oven 640, Quantity of label target used = 20, Mass unit = Micro gram, time = 16, Tiny time unit = hours, Volume unit = Micro litre, temperature = 45)"	"Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in half-strength MS medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) sucrose in a 16 h light and 8 h dark cycle for 10 days. (Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)"
