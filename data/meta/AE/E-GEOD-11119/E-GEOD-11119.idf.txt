Experiment Description	Analysis of sol2 mutant. SOL2 protein is a receptor-like kinase; involved in CLE peptide signalling pathway. Results provide insignt into; the role of SOL2 in CLE signalling. Experiment Overall Design: GeneChip analyses were performed twice for comparison of gene expression in sol2 mutant and wild type plants.

Seeds were sterilised with sodium hypochlorite 5 min, 4 rinses sterile water,  plated on MS media, and incubated at 23Â&deg;C under the continuous light conditions for 4 days.	Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and purified with RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN).	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared from total RNA with GeneChip One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents (Affymetrix).
