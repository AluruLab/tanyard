Investigation Title	Transcriptome analysis in flavonoid overaccumulating and lacking Arabidopsis.														
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome analysis in flavonoid overaccumulating and lacking Arabidopsis.														
Experiment Description	TranscriptoTranscriptome profiling using DNA microarrays of the aerial parts of the wild-type and other plants was conducted to examine if either MYB overexpression or flavonoid overaccumulation is responsible for the expression of stress-related genes involved in both the biotic and abiotic stress response. Comparative transcriptome analysis using DNA microarray in flavonoid overaccumulating and lacking Arabidopsis.

Protocol Name	P-GSE51215-1	P-GSE51215-4	P-GSE51215-5	P-GSE51215-2	P-GSE51215-3	P-GSE51215-6									
Protocol Description	R package in Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/) was used for normalization (MAS5) of the CELL files. ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5	Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip (24K) was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip (24K) was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	Sterilized seeds were kept for 2 days at 4degreesC in the dark and were sown on plates of growth medium (GM) agar containing 1% sucrose. All plates were set in a growth chamber at 22degreesC and relative humidity (approximately 60%) under a 16 h light (approximately 40 umols−1m−2)/8 h dark cycle. The drought stress experiment was conducted at 21degreesC and 40% +/- 5% relative humidity under 16 h/8 h light/dark conditions in a plant growth room. Harvested plant samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80degreesC until use.	Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip (24K) was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip (24K) was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
