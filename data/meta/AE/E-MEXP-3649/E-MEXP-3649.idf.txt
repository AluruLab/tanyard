Experiment Description	MYB10 and MYB72 are two transcription factors expressed in Arabidopsis roots under iron deficiency.  To understand the contribution of these factors, we analyzed gene expression in roots of wild-type (Col) and mutant (myb10myb72 double knockout) seedlings exposed to iron deficiency for 72 hours.

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-26855	P-MTAB-26856
Protocol Description	Plants were stratified for 3 days at 4 degrees in the dark, and then plated on 1/2 B5 + 2% sucrose.  Grown at 21 degrees in a 16/8 light/dark cycle conviron chamber for 2 weeks.  Plants were transferred to -Fe plates (see Colangelo and Guerinot, Plant Cell 2004) for 72hrs and then roots were harvested and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.<br>(Parameters: start time = 2, time unit = weeks, min temperature = 21, temperature unit = C, media = 1/2 B5 + 2%sucrose)	RNA was extracted from plant roots using the standard qiagen plant RNA extraction kit.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)
