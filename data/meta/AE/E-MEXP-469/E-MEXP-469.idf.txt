Protocol Description	plants were grown on soil for 6 weeks at 23C, and 65% relative humidity. Light cycle was short day (SD): 8h light, 16h dark	after 6 weeks a ca.0.3cm apical region was dissected from whole plants and immediately transferred to liquit N2 until sample collection was complete (ca 100mg). Samples were stored at -80C until RNA extraction.	Plant material from several individuals was pooled for each sample. All pooled individuals were grown at the same time, under same conditions. Extracts were prepared from these pools.	pdf of the protocol (Probe preparation Development) can be downloaded at http://www.weigelworld.org/resources/microarray/AtGenExpress/; also at TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org Protocol:501712557	pdf of the protocol (Probe preparation Development) can be downloaded at http://www.weigelworld.org/resources/microarray/AtGenExpress/; also at TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org Protocol:501712557	Title: Affymetrix EukGE-WS2v4_450 Hybridization.
