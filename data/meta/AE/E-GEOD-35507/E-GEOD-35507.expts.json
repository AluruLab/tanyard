CSB3 encodes a 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase, the enzyme controlling the penultimate step of the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate via the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in the chloroplast. It has been proposed that CSB3 represents a point of metabolic convergence modulating the magnitude of SA-mediated disease resistance to biotrophic pathogens. We show that csb3 have increased expression  of a set of genes encoding defense-related proteins and enzymes,  which includes two subtilisins. In essence our results substantiates an important role of these two subtilases in the activation of defense-related signaling pathways against biotrophic pathogens. 5 five-week-old plants were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC. Samples from Col-0 and csb3 were compared."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Pablo Vera","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Vicente Ramírez","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"María J Gil","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Ana López","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Pablo Vera","role":"submitter","email":"vera@ibmcp.upv.es"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23818851,"authors":"Ramï¿½rez V, Lï¿½pez A, Mauch-Mani B, Gil MJ, Vera P","title":"An extracellular subtilase switch for immune priming in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1371\/journal.ppat.1003445"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia (Col-0)"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["csb3","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole plant"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["csb3","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":2,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1002197,"accession":"P-GSE35507-3"},{"id":1002198,"accession":"P-GSE35507-2"},{"id":1002195,"accession":"P-GSE35507-5"},{"id":1002196,"accession":"P-GSE35507-4"},{"id":1002193,"accession":"P-GSE35507-1"},{"id":1002194,"accession":"P-GSE35507-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":2,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":2,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":2,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":2,"isderived":0}]}]}}
