Comment[Submitted Name]	CSB3 transcriptome analysis (Arabidopsis thaliana)
Experiment Description	In this study we show the comparative transcriptome of constitutive subtilisin3 (csb3) plants, an Arabidopsis mutant showing strikingly enhanced resistance to biotrophic pathogens. CSB3 encodes a 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase, the enzyme controlling the penultimate step of the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate via the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in the chloroplast. It has been proposed that CSB3 represents a point of metabolic convergence modulating the magnitude of SA-mediated disease resistance to biotrophic pathogens. We show that csb3 have increased expression  of a set of genes encoding defense-related proteins and enzymes,  which includes two subtilisins. In essence our results substantiates an important role of these two subtilases in the activation of defense-related signaling pathways against biotrophic pathogens. 5 five-week-old plants were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ÂºC. Samples from Col-0 and csb3 were compared.

Protocol Description	GeneChip intensities were background-corrected, normalized and sumarized by MAS5 suite (Affymetrix) ID_REF =  VALUE = Normalized Signal values as calculated by MAS5 (TGT=250)	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 4 µg total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 10 µg of biotinylated cRNA were hybridized to Affymetrix chips (Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array). Each sample was added to a hybridization solution containing 100mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, 1 M Na+, and 20mM of EDTA in the presence of 0.01% of Tween-20 to a final cRNA concentration of 0.05 µg/ml. Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 45ºC . Each microarray was washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin in a Fluidics station 450 (Affymetrix).	Seeds of csb3 mutant and wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana were kept at 4°C for 3 days and sown in jiffy7 peat pellets (Clause-Tezier IbÃ©rica, Paterna, Spain). Plants were grown in a growth phytochamber for 5 weeks with a light intensity of approximately 150-200 µE m-2s-1 at 23°C under 10 h light/14 h dark cycles and 60% humidity.	RNA was isolated with Tri-Reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacture´s instructions. High-quality RNA was obtained by using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).	GeneChips were scanned using the standard Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner
