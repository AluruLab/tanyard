Root branching and expansion of the root system is achieved through the development of lateral roots and is to a large extent controlled by the plant hormone auxin. However, the pleiotropic effects of auxin or auxin-like molecules on root systems complicate the study of lateral root development. Here we describe a small-molecule screen in Arabidopsis thaliana that identified naxillin as what is to our knowledge the first non-auxin-like molecule that promotes root branching. By using naxillin as a chemical tool, we identified a new function for root cap-specific conversion of the auxin precursor indole-3-butyric acid into the active auxin indole-3-acetic acid and uncovered the involvement of the root cap in root branching. Delivery of an auxin precursor in peripheral tissues such as the root cap might represent an important mechanism shaping root architecture. To further explore the specificity of naxillin for lateral root development, we compared the early effects of naxillin at the transcriptome level with NAA (1-Naphthaleneacetic acid) in roots of 3-day-old seedlings after 2-h and 6-h treatment. Arabidopsis thaliana (L). Heynh., Col-0 seeds were germinated vertically on solid medium derived from standard MS medium supplemented with 10 μM NPA (1-N-Naphthylphthalamic acid). Three days after germination, plants were transferred to 10 μM NAA (1-Naphthaleneacetic acid) or 50 μM naxillin for 2 and 6 hours. Plants were sampled before (Roots at T0, NPA) or after treatment (Roots at T1 and T2). RNA isolation was performed on 500 root sections (only root without meristems) for each sample. All sampling points were performed in three independent experiments."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Dominique Audenaert","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Joke Allemeersch","role":"submitter","email":"joke.allemeersch@vib.be"},{"contact":"Bert De Rybel","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":22885787,"authors":"De Rybel B, Audenaert D, Xuan W, Overvoorde P, Strader LC, Kepinski S, Hoye R, Brisbois R, Parizot B, Vanneste S, Liu X, Gilday A, Graham IA, Nguyen L, Jansen L, Njo MF, Inzé D, Bartel B, Beeckman T","title":"A role for the root cap in root branching revealed by the non-auxin probe naxillin.","doi":"10.1038\/nchembio.1044"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["3 day"]},{"category":"biosource provider","value":["Local provider, Bert de Rybel"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["lateral root initiation","no lateral root initiation"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"initial time point","value":["germination"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["1-Naphthaleneacetic acid","mock","naxillin"]},{"name":"time","value":["2 hour","6 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":15,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1175261,"accession":"P-GSE42896-6"},{"id":1175262,"accession":"P-GSE42896-5"},{"id":1175260,"accession":"P-GSE42896-7"},{"id":1175265,"accession":"P-GSE42896-2"},{"id":1175259,"accession":"P-GSE42896-1"},{"id":1175263,"accession":"P-GSE42896-4"},{"id":1175264,"accession":"P-GSE42896-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":15,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":15,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":15,"isderived":0}]}]}}
