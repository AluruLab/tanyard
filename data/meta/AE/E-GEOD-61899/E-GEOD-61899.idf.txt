Protocol Description	The data were analyzed using R version 3.1.  Normalization was performed using the gcrma function from the gcrma package from Bioconductor (version 2.36), and absolute calls (columns labeled ABS_CALL)  were generated using the mas5calls function from the affy package (version 1.42.3), all with default settings.  AGI annotations (column labeled AGI) were matched with Affymetrix probe IDs using the ath1121501.db package from Bioconductor (version 2.14).    Translation state (TL) was calculated as (2*small polysomal + 7*large polysomal)/(non-polysomal + small polysomal + large polysomal) after back-transforming the log2 values. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 GC-RMA signal ABS_CALL = 	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from total and polysome-fractionated RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix) after priming cDNA synthesis with oligo(dT).	cRNA was hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on the GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by a wash with biotinylated antibody goat IgG and another staining with streptavidin-phycoerythrin.	Plants were grown on agar plates with full strength Murashige and Skoog salts, pH 5.7, 1% sucrose, in a 16-hour light/8-hour dark cycle (lights on at 6am) for 10 days.	RNA extraction, polysome fractionation, and microarray hybridization were performed as described previously (Genome Biol. 2007;8(4):R60)	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip 7G high-resolution scanner.
