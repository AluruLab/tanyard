Two approaches were used; GFP reporter genes were used to collect gene expression data in real time within unique GFP imaging hardware, and plants were harvested on orbit to RNAlater for subsequent analyses of gene expression with using Affymetrix and SAGE transcriptome analyses. Three tissue types were examined (leaves, hypocotyls and roots) and compared to analyses conducted with whole plants.  Transcriptome analyses with whole plants suggested that the spaceflight environment had little impact on the transcriptome of arabidopsis, however, closer examination of selected tissues revealed that there are a number of tissue-specific responses that arabidopsis employs to respond to this novel environment"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Robert J Ferl","role":"investigator","email":"robferl@ufl.edu"},{"contact":"Agata K Zupanska","role":"submitter","email":"zupanska@ufl.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23919896,"authors":"Paul AL, Zupanska AK, Schultz ER, Ferl RJ","title":"Organ-specific remodeling of the Arabidopsis transcriptome in response to spaceflight","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2229-13-112","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["12 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["60% Wassilewskija, 40% Col-0","Wassilewskija"]},{"category":"growth condition","value":["Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) at Ground Control Orbiter Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center","Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) at International Space Station"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["hypocotyl","root","shoot","whole plant"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["ground control","spaceflight environment"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["hypocotyl","root","shoot","whole plant"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":36,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1229738,"accession":"P-MTAB-28101"},{"id":1229736,"accession":"P-MTAB-28103"},{"id":1229737,"accession":"P-MTAB-28102"},{"id":1229734,"accession":"P-MTAB-28105"},{"id":1229735,"accession":"P-MTAB-28104"},{"id":1229732,"accession":"P-MTAB-28107"},{"id":1229733,"accession":"P-MTAB-28106"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":36,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":36,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
