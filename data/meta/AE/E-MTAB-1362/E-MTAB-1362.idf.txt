Comment[Submitted Name]	Dawn anticipation
Experiment Description	To investigate the role of TIC in the morning perception process, we performed a transcriptome analysis of the wild type and time for coffee mutant (tic-2) at dawn. An additional file is included. In this file, the expression values for the replicates are condensed in a single data point obtaining one mean and standard deviation of the expression values per genotype. The protocol for this file is: log2 fold change followed by a False Discovery Rate with a p-value equal or below 0.05.

Protocol Description	Samples were grown on MS3 media 3% sucrose for 7 days, prior to the dawn of the 8th day, they were collected. Col-0 wild type and tic-2 mutant, a T-DNA insertion, were used. 12:12 photoperiod, samplig took place 10 minutes before dawn of the 8th day. 2 biological replicates per genotype were performed.	Sample collection 10 minutes before dawn on the 8th day of growth	Total RNA extraction	cDNA using the MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced kit from Ambion	GC-RMA algorithm and a Cyber-T statistical test for pair comparisons	Hybridization with Affymetrix protocol EukGe-WS2v4 by using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450
