Experiment Description	The study of natural genetic variation for plant disease resistance responses is a complementary approach to utilizing mutants to elucidate genetic pathways.  While some key genes involved in pathways controlling disease resistance, and signaling intermediates such as salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), have been identified through mutational analyses, the use of genetic variation in natural populations permits the identification of change-of-function alleles, which likely act in a quantitative manner.  Whole genome microarrays, such as Affymetrix GeneChips, allow for molecular characterization of the disease response at a genomics level and characterization of differences in gene expression due to natural variation.  Differences in the level of gene expression, or expression level polymorphisms (ELPs), can be mapped in a segregating population to identify regulatory quantitative trait loci (expression QTLs, e-QTLs) affecting host resistance responses.  We assessed Arabidopsis accessions Bayreuth-0 (Bay-0) and Shahdara (Sha) for natural variation in the response to JA.  We treated vegetatively grown plants with either JA or a control solution (Silwet), and harvested the plants 4, 28, or 52 hours after chemical treatment.  We present Affymetrix GeneChip microarray expression data for 2 biological replications of the control (Silwet) samples for Bay-0 and Sha.  These GeneChips were used to generate genetic markers which allowed the development of high-density haplotype maps of a Bay-0 x Sha RIL population.

Protocol Description	Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Bay-0 and Sha were obtained from ABRC through TAIR (www.arabidopsis.org).  A factorial experiment was conducted with two biological replicates of the two accessions.  For each biological replicate , multiple plants (~50) per accession were grown in a growth chamber under short day conditions (8 hr light at 100-120 microEinsteins, 20 degrees C day/20 degrees C night) to maintain plants in the vegetative phase for six weeks.  The growth chambers used a combination of metal halide, mercury vapor, and incandescent lamps. Plants were watered with half-strength Hoagland's solution.  JA and/or Silwet treatment: Six-week-old plants were sprayed with 0.10 mM JA (jasmonic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)  in 0.02% Silwet L77 to run-off, and control plants were sprayed with 0.02% Silwet L77, a surfactant (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX, USA), alone.  Due to the volatile nature of JA, treated and control plants were placed in separate growth chambers after chemical treatment.  Vegetative leaves from plants from each combination of accession and treatment were harvested at 4, 28, and 52 hours post-treatment, and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extractions. Three plants per accession were bulked for each treatment/time point combination. Each plant was harvested only once. To avoid diurnal variation in gene expression, the time points were 24 hrs apart and harvesting was always performed over a 30 minute period at the same time of day (1:00 PM). ONLY THE SILWET TREATED CONTROL SAMPLES ARE INCLUDED IN THIS SUBMISSION, BECAUSE ONLY THE CONTROL MICROARRAYS WERE USED FOR THIS EXPERIMENT TO DERIVE GENETIC MARKERS.	RNA was extracted from the bulked plants using TRIzol as per the manufacturers protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by purification on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).	cDNA synthesis was conducted according to the manufacturers guidelines in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual 701021 rev1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).  Biotin labeling was conducted using an Affymetrix IVT labeling kit.	Title: Affymetrix EukGE-WS2v4_450 Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
