Investigation Title	H. arabidopsidis EMWA1 infection, time course experiment																		
Comment[Submitted Name]	H. arabidopsidis EMWA1 infection, time course experiment																		
Experiment Description	We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes. We focused on those genes that were dramatically induced (>2-fold) in WT but not in the rpp4 mutant at 2 dpi when WT and rpp4 first showed distinct phenotypes 2-week old Col wild-type plants and rpp4 mutants were infected with spores from 10-day old H. arabidopsidis EMWA1. Leaves were harvested at 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 6 days post-inoculation. Replicates are derived from two independent biological experiments, with no overlap in growing periods.

Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 10 days at 16-18°C, 12-hr day length, 80-100% relative humidity	Mixed-model ANOVA used to globally normalize all arrays and to identify differentially expressed probe sets is described in (Ref. 1 and 2).	Ref. 2: Levesque, M. P. et al. Whole-genome analysis of the SHORT-ROOT developmental pathway in Arabidopsis. PLoS biology 4, 1284-1284 (2006).	Ref. 1: Brady, S. M. et al. A high-resolution root spatiotemporal map reveals dominant expression patterns. Science 318, 801-806 (2007).	Immediately following hybridization, the hybridized probe arrays undergo an automated washing and staining protocol on the GeneChip® FS450 fluidic station and are then scanned on the GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G Plus where patterns of hybridization are detected.	2-week old Col-0 wild-type plants and rpp4 mutants were infected with spores (500,000 spores / 1ml in dH2O) from 10-day old H. arabidopsidis EMWA1. Leaves were harvested at 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 6 days post-inoculation. Replicates are derived from two independent biological experiments, with no overlap in growing periods.	Total RNA was isolated from the frozen material using the Qiagen RNeasy kit	RNA probes were labelled using the GeneChip® Eukaryotic Small Sample Target Labelling Assay Version II.
