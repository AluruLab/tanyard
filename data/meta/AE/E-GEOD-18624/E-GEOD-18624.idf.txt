Comment[Submitted Name]	H2A.Z - Containing Nucleosomes Mediate the Thermosensory Response in Arabidopsis							
Experiment Description	We isolated mutants in Arabidopsis with enhanced ambient temperature response. Microarray analysis was performed to understand the extent to which ambient temperature transcriptome is perturbed in the mutants in comparison with the WT at non inductive 12 ºC and after shift to inductive 27 ºC for 2 h and 24 h. We performed global transcript profiling to understand the regulation of of gene expression underlying ambient temperature response. Sterilized wild type Arabidopsis Col-0 as well as the arp6-10 mutant seeds were plated on half-strength MS plates without sugar. Plates were incubated at 4 ºC in dark  for 48 hours before transfering to 20 ºC  with light. 5 day old seedlings were transfered to 12 ºC incubaor with continuous light for 3 days befroe shifting to 27 ºC. Samples (Whole seedlings) were collected before shifting (0 h) and 2 h and 24 h after shifting to 27 ºC by immediately freezing in liquid nitrogen.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS 5 signal<br>ABS_CALL = <br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Following fragmentation, 1µ ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45 ºC Arabidopsis ATH1 microarray. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station.	Sterilized wild type Arabidopsis Col-0 as well as the arp6-10 mutant seeds were plated on half-strength MS plates without sugar. Plates were incubated at 4 ºC in dark  for 48 hours before transfering to 20 ºC  with light. 5 day old seedlings were transfered to 12 ºC incubaor with continuous light for 3 days befroe shifting to 27 ºC.	Quality checks and data analyses were carried out using Affymetrix GeneChip® Operating Software(GCOS) and quality reporter	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip® Scanner 3000	A set of seedlings incubated at 12 ºC were shifted to 27 ºC. Samples (Whole seedlings) were collected before shifting (0 h) and 2 h and 24 h after shifting to 27 ºC by immediately freezing in liquid nitrogen.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix GeneChip® protocol (Affymetrix) from 1µg total RNA.
