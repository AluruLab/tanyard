Microarray analysis was performed to understand the extent to which ambient temperature transcriptome is perturbed in the mutants in comparison with the WT at non inductive 12 ºC and after shift to inductive 27 ºC for 2 h and 24 h. We performed global transcript profiling to understand the regulation of of gene expression underlying ambient temperature response. Sterilized wild type Arabidopsis Col-0 as well as the arp6-10 mutant seeds were plated on half-strength MS plates without sugar. Plates were incubated at 4 ºC in dark  for 48 hours before transfering to 20 ºC  with light. 5 day old seedlings were transfered to 12 ºC incubaor with continuous light for 3 days befroe shifting to 27 ºC. Samples (Whole seedlings) were collected before shifting (0 h) and 2 h and 24 h after shifting to 27 ºC by immediately freezing in liquid nitrogen."}],"provider":[{"contact":"S V Kumar","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Philip A Wigge","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Vinod Kumar","role":"submitter","email":"vinod.kumar@bbsrc.ac.uk"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20079334,"authors":"Kumar SV, Wigge PA","title":"H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes mediate the thermosensory response in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1016\/j.cell.2009.11.006","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["8 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["arp6-10","Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["arp6-10","Col-0"]},{"name":"TEMPERATURE","value":["12 degree_C","27 degree_C"]},{"name":"TREATMENT TIME","value":["2 hours","24 hours","n\/a hours"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":447783,"accession":"P-GSE18624-4"},{"id":447780,"accession":"P-GSE18624-3"},{"id":447779,"accession":"P-GSE18624-6"},{"id":447777,"accession":"P-GSE18624-8"},{"id":447778,"accession":"P-GSE18624-7"},{"id":447782,"accession":"P-GSE18624-5"},{"id":447781,"accession":"P-GSE18624-2"},{"id":447776,"accession":"P-GSE18624-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0}]}]}}
