Investigation Title	Photoreceptor control of shoot meristem activity and leaf initiation															
Comment[Submitted Name]	Photoreceptor control of shoot meristem activity and leaf initiation															
Experiment Description	When Arabidopsis seedlings are grown in the dark, their shoot meristem remains in a repressed state and does not develop leaves. The tight control of leaf development by light provides the opportunity to analyse a fundamental plant developmental process in its very early stages. We have observed that activation of photoreceptors in dark-grown seedlings leads to a rapid and dramatic increase in mitotic activity in and around the shoot meristem. Cotyledons also exhibit an induction of cell cycle activity by light, but this consists of endoreduplication and occurs later. Many other processes take place upon induction by light, including the development of the photosynthetic apparatus and the synthesis of sunscreens, but these processes are expected to take place in both the leaf primordia and the cotyledons. We have used this information to carry out a whole transcriptome analysis of shoot meristem activation and early stages of leaf development by light. For this we dissected the shoot apical regions from seedlings grown in the dark or 1, 2, 6, 24, 48 or 72 h after transfer to light. We also dissected cotyledons from equivalent seedlings grown in the dark or 1 or 6 h after transfer to light. From these samples we obtained RNA used for hybridisations against the ATH1 GenChip. 16 samples were used in this experiment.

Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Seedlings were immersed in RNAlater (Ambion) for 1 h (the harvesting and immersion being under green safelight), and stored at 4°C. Within one week seedlings were dissected on a chilled platform under a stereomicroscope, by slicing below the meristem and at the base of each cotyledon ('meristem' or M samples) or near the base and tip of each cotyledon ('cotyledon' or C samples), before flash-freezing and storing at -80°C. Only one tissue was obtained per seedling and the number of seedlings per sample ranged from ca.1500 (72 h samples) to over 4000 (0 h samples). Each sample contained material from multiple plates and several separate experiments. RNA was extracted using an RiboPure kit (Ambion), essentially according to manufacturer's instructions.	Seedlings were raised by exposing stratified seeds, sown on agar-solidified Murashige and Skoog medium (without sucrose), for 30 min to 100 micromol m-2 s-1 fluorescent cool white light, on horizontal plates as described (Vinti et al.; The Plant Journal 24(6), 883-894, 2000), to stimulate germination. The plates were placed in a dark incubator at 21 C for 3 days, at which time they were transfered back to white light for 1 h before harvesting.
