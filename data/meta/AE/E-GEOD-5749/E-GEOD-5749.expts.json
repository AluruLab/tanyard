Benfey's lab through ArexDB (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.arexdb.org\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.arexdb.org<\/a>). A global map of gene expression within an organ can identify genes with coordinated expression in localized domains, thereby relating gene activity to cell fate and tissue specialization. Here, we present localization of expression of more than 22,000 genes in the Arabidopsis root. Gene expression was mapped to 15 different zones of the root that correspond to cell types and tissues at progressive developmental stages. Patterns of gene expression traverse traditional anatomical boundaries and show cassettes of hormonal response. Chromosomal clustering defined some coregulated genes. This expression map correlates groups of genes to specific cell fates and should serve to guide reverse genetics.
