Experiment Description	ATH1 GeneChip was used for gene expression analysis of wild-type plants and dor mutant under drought treatment (both the wild-type and dor plants were grown under normal watering conditions for 24 days and then stressed by completely depriving of irrigation for 10 days). Two biological repeat experiments were conducted and the raw data was analyzed applying Affymetrix GCOS software. Experiment Overall Design: ATH1 GeneChip was used for gene expression analysis of wild-type plants and dor mutant under drought treatment (both the wild-type and dor plants were grown under normal watering conditions for 24 days and then stressed by completely depriving of irrigation for 10 days).

Protocol Description	WT plants were grown under normal watering conditions for 34 days. Arabidopsis rosette leaves samples were homogenized in liquid nitrogen prior to RNA isolation Arabidopsis plants were grown   in soil under long-day conditions (16 hr light; 8 hr dark) at 22 degree	WT plants were grown under normal watering conditions for 24 days and then stressed by completely depriving of irrigation for 10 days. Arabidopsis rosette leaves samples were homogenized in liquid nitrogen prior to RNA isolation Arabidopsis plants were grown in soil under long-day conditions (16 hr light; 8 hr dark) at 22 degree	dor  plants were grown under normal watering conditions for 24 days and then stressed by completely depriving of irrigation for 10 days.
