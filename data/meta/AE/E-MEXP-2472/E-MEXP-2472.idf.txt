Protocol Description	Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen Plant RNeasy MiniKit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturers instruction. The quality of the isolated RNA was determined with a NanoDrop ND 1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Delaware, USA) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). Only samples with a 260 nm/280 nm ratio between 1.82.1 and a 28S/18S ratio within 1.52 were processed further.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (accession Columbia) were grown on half-strength MS medium for 4 days at 23 C in complete darkness and then transferred for 4 h to constant cool-white light (light-treated seedlings) or kept in darkness (dark-grown seedlings) before whole seedlings (~50 per sample) were harvested.<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, min temperature = 23, temperature unit = C, media = 1/2 MS)	One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix, P/N 900431, Santa Clara, CA) <br>(Parameters: Amount of nucleic acid labeled = 2, Amplification = RNA polymerases, Mass unit = Micro gram)	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
