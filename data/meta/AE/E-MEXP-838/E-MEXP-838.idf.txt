Experiment Description	microRNAs function as sequence-specific guides to regulate genes by post-transcriptional gene silencing. Many miRNAs are involved in the control plant development by regulating the accumulation of transcripts encoding transcription factors. This causes pleiotropic developmental phenotypes of mutants defective in miRNA accumulation, such as dcl1, hen1, hyl1 and ago1. The serrate-1 (se-1) mutant of Arabidopsis also exhibits a highly pleiotropic phenotype which overlaps with phenotypes of mutants defective in miRNA accumulation. It has been proposed that SE functions specifically in miRNA-mediated repression of the leaf polarity genes PHABULOSA and PHAVOLUTA. Microarray analysis of transcript levels in se-1 compared to wild-type however revealed upregulation of many genes known to be targets of miRNA regulation. We show that SE is a general regulator of miRNA levels probably controlling processing of pri-miRNA to miRNA.

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (ecotype Col-4) were surface sterilised and sown on GM medium (= MS medium without sucrose) containing Gamborgs Vitamin Solution (Sigma). Seedlings were grown under long-day conditions (16 hr light, 8 hr dark) at 20°C for 10 days. All samples from 10-day-old seedlings and all aerial parts (leaves, cotyledons and hypocotyls) were used for total RNA isolation.	Total RNA was extracted from 10-day-old wild-type and se-1 mutant seedlings using TRI Reagent (Sigma) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Total RNA samples were further cleaned using RNAeasy mini-columns (Qiagen).	Starting total RNA quality was assessed by running 1ul of each RNA sample on Agilent RNA6000nano LabChips (Agilent Technology 2100 Bioanalyzer Version A.01.20 SI211). Total RNA quantity was assessed by running 1ul of each RNA sample on a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed according to the Affymetrix Manual II, using 5ug of total RNA. Second strand cDNA synthesis was performed with minor modifications to the Affymetrix Manual II. Brieflly, cDNA termini were not blunt ended and the reaction was not terminated using EDTA. Instead Double-stranded cDNA products were immediately purified following the ÂPhase Lock Gel Cleanup of Double-Stranded cDNA protocol (Affymetrix Manual II). cDNA was resuspended in 22ul of RNAse free water. cRNA preparation was performed with minor modifications to the Affymetrix Manual II.  Briefly, 11ul of cDNA was used as a template to produce biotinylated cRNA using half the recommended volumes of the ENZO BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit. Labelled cRNAs were purified following the ÂQiagen RNeasy Cleanup and Quantification of Biotin-Labeled cRNAÂ protocol (Affymetrix Manual II). cRNA quality was assessed by on Agilent RNA6000nano LabChips (Agilent Technology 2100 Bioanalyzer Version A.01.20 SI211). cRNA quantity was assessed by running 1ul of each cRNA sample on a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies).
