A single pair (control & hypoxia) of GeneChips® was used to confirm that hypoxia treatment altered the expression of an overlapping set of genes controlled by KIN10 (At3g01090) in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Experiment Overall Design: For the hypoxic treatment protoplasts were submerged in mannitol buffer and the hypoxia condition was confirmed by the activation of the well-established early marker genes ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase, At1g77120) and PDC1 (pyruvate decarboxylase-1, At4g33070) based on RT-PCR and GeneChip® analyses. Results show a clear overlap in genes induced under hypoxic conditions and those induced by KIN10 expression in protoplasts. The overlap of the gene expression profiles was confirmed by triplicated real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses of selected marker genes."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Elena Baena-Gonzalez","role":"submitter","email":"baena@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":17671505,"authors":"Elena Baena-González, Filip Rolland, Johan M Thevelein, Jen Sheen","title":"A central integrator of transcription networks in plant stress and energy signalling.","doi":"10.1038\/nature06069","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"CellType","value":["mesophyll cell"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GROWTH CONDITION","value":["control","hypoxia"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":2,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":422981,"accession":"P-G8248-2"},{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":422978,"accession":"P-G8248-3"},{"id":422980,"accession":"P-G8248-1"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":422982,"accession":"P-G8248-5"},{"id":422979,"accession":"P-G8248-4"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":2,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":2,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":2,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":2,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
