Experiment Description	The goal of this experiment was to investigate the early transcript changes (6h) induced by hypoxia treatment in mesophyll protoplasts. A single pair (control & hypoxia) of GeneChipsÂ® was used to confirm that hypoxia treatment altered the expression of an overlapping set of genes controlled by KIN10 (At3g01090) in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Experiment Overall Design: For the hypoxic treatment protoplasts were submerged in mannitol buffer and the hypoxia condition was confirmed by the activation of the well-established early marker genes ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase, At1g77120) and PDC1 (pyruvate decarboxylase-1, At4g33070) based on RT-PCR and GeneChipÂ® analyses. Results show a clear overlap in genes induced under hypoxic conditions and those induced by KIN10 expression in protoplasts. The overlap of the gene expression profiles was confirmed by triplicated real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses of selected marker genes.

Protocol Description	For protoplast isolation, leaves were harvested 2h after the onset of the light period. Protoplasts (about 3 million) were freshly isolated from the fifth and sixth leaves of 36 randomly picked plants and pooled for two large protoplast samples. Control cells (1.5 x 10-6) were incubated in 10 ml mannitol buffer in a 150 x 15 mm Petri dish (0.6 mm depth) for 6h under a light intensity of 80 microEinstein.	For protoplast isolation, leaves were harvested 2h after the onset of the light period. Protoplasts (about 3 million) were freshly isolated from the fifth and sixth leaves of 36 randomly picked plants and pooled for two large protoplast samples. For hypoxia treatment, cells (1.5 x 10-6) were incubated in 2 ml mannitol buffer in a 15 ml Falcon tube (25 mm depth) for 6h under a light intensity of 80 microEinstein.	Plants were grown in soil (Metro Mix-360) under 13h light (80-100 mmol/m2s) /11 h dark conditions at 23Â&deg;C and 65% relative humidity.	Total RNA was extracted using TrizolÂ® (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was further purified using a Qiagen RNEasy Mini Kit.	Eight micrograms of purified total RNA was labeled for hybridization using an ENZO BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (T7) following standard Affymetrix protocols (Affymetrix GeneChip Technical Analysis Manual)	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
