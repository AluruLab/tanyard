Protocol Description	"Total RNA was isolated from plant material using Plant RNeasy columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers instructions.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"	"Plants were shifted from short day (SD; 8hr light, 16 hr darkness) to long day (LD; 16 hr light, 8 hr darkness) to synchronously induce flowering."	"Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown at 23°C and 65% rel. humidity on soil. Light conditions: Mixture of Cool White and Gro-Lux Wide Spectrum fluorescent lights, with a fluence rate of 125 to 175 µmol m-2 s-1. <br><br><br>(Parameters: time unit = days, temperature unit = C)"	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
