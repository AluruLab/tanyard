Protocol Name	P-MTAB-21886	P-MTAB-21887	
Protocol Description	Arabidopsis plants, ecotype Columbia, and T-DNA insertional lines were sown in individual pots in soil media and stratified at 4ﾺC for 48 hours before being transfered to long day growth conditions (16 hours light and 8 hours dark cycle) at a light intensity of 150 uEinsteins, 22ﾺC, 55% relative humidity and watered as needed. <br>(Parameters: start time = 16, time unit = days, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C, media = Soil mix in pots)	Leaf samples were collected, snap frozen and ground under liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit(Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions, quality was verified using a Bioanalyzer and spectrophotometric analysis was carried out to determine the A260:A280 and A260:A230 ratios to ensure both ratios were between 1.9 - 2.1<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)
