Experiment Description	4 week old Arabidopsis plants, of ecotype Columbia, SALK_084897 or SAIL_303_D08 were either grown under normal conditions or grown under normal conditions for before having a moderate light and drought treatment applied. Light and drought treatment was applied by withholding water for 5 days prior to transfer to 300 uE m-2 s-1 light conditions. Samples were collected after 3 days of treatment or for the same age plants grown under normal conditions.

Protocol Description	Col-0, SALK_084897 and SAIL_303_D08 4 week old plants grown under normal conditions were not watered for 5 days, after which they were transfered to moderate light conditions (300 uE m-2 s-1) for 3 days, still withholding water.	Arabidopsis plants, ecotype Columbia, and T-DNA insertional lines SALK_084897 and SAIL_303_D08 were sown in individual pots in soil media and statified at 4ºC for 48 hours before being transfered to long day growth conditions (16 hours light and 8 hours dark cycle) at a light intensity of 100 uEinsteins, 22ºC, 55% relative humidity and watered as needed.  	Leaf samples were collected, snap frozen and ground under liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit(Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions, quality was verified using a Bioanalyzer and spectrophotometric analysis was carried out to determine the A260:A280 and A260:A230 ratios 	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
