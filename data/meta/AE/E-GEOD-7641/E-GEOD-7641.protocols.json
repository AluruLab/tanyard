Seeds were stratified at 4ËšC for 2 days before being planted on standard media.  Standard media is 1X concentration Murashige and Skoog salt mixture (Caisson laboratories), 0.5g\/L MES, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH.  Salt media is standard media with varying amounts of NaCl added.  Nylon mesh was placed on top of the solidified media and seeds were evenly placed on the mesh at a density of ~20 seeds\/cm in two rows.","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1125677,"accession":"P-G7641-2","name":null,"text":"Samples were prepared as in Birnbaum et al.
