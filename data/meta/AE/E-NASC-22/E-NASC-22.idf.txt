Experiment Description	PCD is a highly organised process that is involved in development and in an organisms response to biotic stresses (toxins and avirulent pathogens) and abiotic stresses (such as temperature, water availability, etc.).  It is a genetically regulated form of cellular suicide, however in plants the underlying process is poorly understood.  Although PCD may occur in response to different stimuli; we believe once it is triggered, one core mechanism is responsible for the cellular demise.  It is our aim to identify the elements of this mechanism.  We will do this by expanding on the work of a previous user of GARNet's GeneChip microarray facility, Dr. Jodi Swidzinski.  She utilised an Arabidopsis cell suspension system; performing microarray analysis on both senescing, and heat shock induced PCD samples.  This resulted in data showing that a large number of genes were upregulated (or downregulated) in response to both treatments.  We are working under the premise that some of the genes that were similarly regulated under both treatments must be core PCD genes.  However because of the large amount of data generated it is difficult to choose appropriate candidate genes (with any degree of confidence that they are core genes) for further study.   We propose to use a third PCD-inducing treatment, involving a mycotoxin, to generate another population of microarray results.  The mycotoxin we intend to use is Fumonisin B1 (FB1).  This is an extremely potent compound that induces PCD by disrupting ceramide synthesis.  We have found Arabidopsis protoplasts to be much more sensitive than cells to the toxin at low concentrations.  Protoplasts are treated with 20mM FB1 and RNA is extracted at time points when 0%, 20% and 40% of protoplasts have died.  This RNA is then pooled.  RNA from methanol treated protoplasts is used as a control.  We intend for these RNA samples to be subjected to GeneChip microarray analysis.  This would identify genes differentially regulated due to FB1 treatment, which would be interesting in itself.  However, by combining this data with that from previous work by Swidzinski (2002) we will be able to decrease the pool of possible core genes further, and increase the chances of selecting an appropriate candidate gene.  This will both improve upon existing work and add value to an existing GARNet data set.

Protocol Description	 from these samples.  This RNA was then pooled into one sample. 			 from these samples.  This RNA was then pooled into one sample. 					Protocol: Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol 	RNA samples were quality controlled using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. 100 pmol T7-(dT)24 primer (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24-3')  was hybridized with the Total RNA ( 8 - 12ug) at 70ÃÂ°C for 10 minutes.  First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM ÃÂ-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.
