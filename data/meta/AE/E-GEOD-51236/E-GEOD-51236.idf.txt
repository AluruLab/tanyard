Investigation Title	Expression data from MTF mutant roots						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from MTF mutant roots						
Experiment Description	Mutation of MTF in Arabidopsis increases Agrobacterium-mediated transformation susceptibility. Being a putative transcription factor, different genes controlling transformation may be regulated by MTF. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression and to identify genes that play a role in transformation. Root samples from mutants MTF1-1 and MTF1-4, along with the wild-type, Col0, were collected after 12 days of growth in B5 liquid medium. RNA was extracted from three biological replicates, with 20 plants in each replicate, and used for hybridization to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.

Protocol Name	P-GSE51236-1	P-GSE51236-5	P-GSE51236-6	P-GSE51236-2	P-GSE51236-3	P-GSE51236-4	P-GSE51236-7
Protocol Description	The data were analyzed employing the software packages &quot;Biobase&quot; and &quot;affy&quot; in Bioconductor. ID_REF =  VALUE = Signal ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M) DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Hybridization was carried out according to the Affymetrix protocol (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Roots were harvested from wild-type Col0 and mutant mtf1-1 and mtf1-4 plants and stored at -80C till RNA extraction.	14-day old Arabidopsis seedlings were transferred to B5 liquid medium and grown at 23C with shaking at 100 rpm for 12 days.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.
