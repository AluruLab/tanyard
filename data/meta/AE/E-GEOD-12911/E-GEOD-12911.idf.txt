Experiment Description	As the gate for gas exchange and water vapor, stomata play an essential role in plant development. It has been a long time that many research focus on how the opening and closing of stomata is controlled. Until recently, studies on how stomata are formed in Arabidopsis just emerge. With a cluster of guard cells in one stomate in flp-1/myb88 mutant, it will be great interest to understand how FLP/MYB88 control stomata development. By taking advantaging of microarray technology, we intend to study a set of genes regulated by FLP/MYB88, which will facilitate us to better explore the biological functions of FLP/MYB88 in stomata development, even in the biotic or abiotic stresses. Experiment Overall Design: By comparing the gene expression differences between the wild type and stomata mutant--flp-1/myb88, we are trying to see which genes' transcripts are affected in flp-1/myb88 mutant.

Protocol Description	Constitutive light, 22 degree	RNA was extracted with Qiagen RNeasy Plant RNA extraction kit	Following confirmation of RNA quality, Ovationâ¢ Biotin RNA Amplification and Labeling System (NuGen Technologies, Inc., San Carlos, CA) is used to prepare amplified, biotin-labeled cDNA from total RNA for following manufacturerâs instructions. Briefly, first strand cDNA is synthesized from 25 ng of total RNA using a unique first strand DNA/RNA chimeric primer and reverse transcriptase. Following double strand cDNA generation, amplification of cDNA is achieved by utilizing an isothermal DNA amplification process that involves repeated SPIAâ¢ DNA/RNA primer binding, DNA duplication, strand displacement and RNA cleavage. The amplified SPIAâ¢ cDNA is purified and subjected to a two-step fragmentation and labeling process. The fragmented/biotinylated cDNA content is measured in a ND-1000 spectrophotometer and the quality was analyzed on an RNA 6000 Nano LabChip (Agilent) using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.
