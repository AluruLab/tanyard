It has been a long time that many research focus on how the opening and closing of stomata is controlled. Until recently, studies on how stomata are formed in Arabidopsis just emerge. With a cluster of guard cells in one stomate in flp-1\/myb88 mutant, it will be great interest to understand how FLP\/MYB88 control stomata development. By taking advantaging of microarray technology, we intend to study a set of genes regulated by FLP\/MYB88, which will facilitate us to better explore the biological functions of FLP\/MYB88 in stomata development, even in the biotic or abiotic stresses. Experiment Overall Design: By comparing the gene expression differences between the wild type and stomata mutant--flp-1\/myb88, we are trying to see which genes' transcripts are affected in flp-1\/myb88 mutant."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Zidian Xie","role":"submitter","email":"xzd482@yahoo.com"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":3,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":13531,"accession":"P-G12911-4"},{"id":13530,"accession":"P-G12911-2"},{"id":13529,"accession":"P-G12911-3"},{"id":13532,"accession":"P-G12911-1"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":3,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":3,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":3,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":3,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
