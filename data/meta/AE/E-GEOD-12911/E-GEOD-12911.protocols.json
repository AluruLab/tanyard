Briefly, first strand cDNA is synthesized from 25 ng of total RNA using a unique first strand DNA\/RNA chimeric primer and reverse transcriptase. Following double strand cDNA generation, amplification of cDNA is achieved by utilizing an isothermal DNA amplification process that involves repeated SPIA™ DNA\/RNA primer binding, DNA duplication, strand displacement and RNA cleavage. The amplified SPIA™ cDNA is purified and subjected to a two-step fragmentation and labeling process. The fragmented\/biotinylated cDNA content is measured in a ND-1000 spectrophotometer and the quality was analyzed on an RNA 6000 Nano LabChip (Agilent) using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0},{"id":13529,"accession":"P-G12911-3","name":"P-G12911-3","text":"Affy-GUI, normalized by RMA","type":"bioassay_data_transformation","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0},{"id":13531,"accession":"P-G12911-4","name":"P-G12911-4","text":"RNA was extracted with Qiagen RNeasy Plant RNA extraction kit","type":"nucleic_acid_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0}]}}
