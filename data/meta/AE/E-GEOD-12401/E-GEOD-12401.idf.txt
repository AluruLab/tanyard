Experiment Description	An Arabidopsis mutant showing an altered ability to green on illumination after extended periods of darkness has been isolated in a screen for genomes uncoupled (gun) mutants. Following illumination for 24 h, 10-day-old dark-grown mutant seedlings accumulated 5 times more chlorophyll than wild-type seedlings and this was correlated with differences in plastid morphology observed by transmission electron microscopy. The mutant has been named greening after extended darkness 1 (ged1). We used microarrays to detail the global profiles of transcript abundances in the mutant in comparison to the wild type. Microarray analysis showed much lower amounts of transcripts of genes encoding seed storage proteins, oleosins and late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins in 7-day-old seedlings of ged1 compared to wild type. RNA-gel-blot analyses confirmed very low levels of transcripts of seed protein genes in ged1 seedlings grown for 2-10 days in the dark, and showed higher amounts of transcripts of photosynthesis-related genes in illuminated 10-day-old dark-grown ged1 seedlings compared to wild type.  Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA samples were extracted from wild-type Ws and ged1 seedlings grown for 5 days in the dark followed by 2 days in the light and hybridised on Affymetrix ATH-121501 arrays. Transcript amounts between wild-type Ws and ged1 seedlings were compared globally.

Protocol Description	After the stratification, the dish was then removed to specified dark (22 C) and light (22 C under a mixture of cool white and GRO-LUX fluorescent lights in 3:2 ratio with average light intensity of 60 mole m-2 s-1 and 16-h diurnal photoperiod) periods.	The seeds were spread on 0.7 % (w/v) micro agar containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium in a 9-cm petri dish stratified at 4 C in the dark for overnight.	Concert Plant RNA Reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) using the manufacturerâs large-scale isolation protocol.	cDNA was synthesised from 6.6 ug total RNA in accordance with the prescribed Affymetrix protocal. Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol using Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labelling Kit.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
