Following illumination for 24 h, 10-day-old dark-grown mutant seedlings accumulated 5 times more chlorophyll than wild-type seedlings and this was correlated with differences in plastid morphology observed by transmission electron microscopy. The mutant has been named greening after extended darkness 1 (ged1). We used microarrays to detail the global profiles of transcript abundances in the mutant in comparison to the wild type. Microarray analysis showed much lower amounts of transcripts of genes encoding seed storage proteins, oleosins and late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins in 7-day-old seedlings of ged1 compared to wild type. RNA-gel-blot analyses confirmed very low levels of transcripts of seed protein genes in ged1 seedlings grown for 2-10 days in the dark, and showed higher amounts of transcripts of photosynthesis-related genes in illuminated 10-day-old dark-grown ged1 seedlings compared to wild type.  Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA samples were extracted from wild-type Ws and ged1 seedlings grown for 5 days in the dark followed by 2 days in the light and hybridised on Affymetrix ATH-121501 arrays. Transcript amounts between wild-type Ws and ged1 seedlings were compared globally."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Mun-Kit Choy","role":"submitter","email":"jcg2@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":18931353,"authors":"Choy MK, Sullivan JA, Theobald JC, Davies WJ, Gray JC.","title":"An Arabidopsis mutant able to green after extended dark periods shows decreased transcripts of seed protein genes and altered sensitivity to abscisic acid.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Wassilewskija"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["ged1 mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"phenotype","value":["green","pale"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["ged1 mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":1132682,"accession":"P-G12401-4"},{"id":1132684,"accession":"P-G12401-2"},{"id":1132681,"accession":"P-G12401-3"},{"id":1132683,"accession":"P-G12401-1"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
