Protocol Description	All Arabidopsis thaliana plants (ecotype Columbia-0 and MYB94 OX transgenic lines in the Columbia-0 background) were grown in pots on a soil mixture (3:2:1 mixture of peat moss-enriched soil:vermiculite:perlite). seeds were cold-treated for 3d at 4 C in the dark before being transferred to a controlled growth room under long-day conditions (16-/8-h light/dark cycle) at 22 to 23 C and relative 50% humidity. 	Total RNAs were isolated from Arabidopsis stems using a RNeasyâ“‡ Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.	The biotin labeled cRNA was synthesized using synthesied cDNA as a template in vitro transcription reaction	Hybridization was conducted by using the Gene Chip Expression Analysis Techical Manual (Affymetrix)	The chips were stained and washed in a Genechip Fluidics Station 450(Affymetrix) and scanned by using a Genechip Array scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix). And the image data was extracted through Affymetrix Commnad Console software1.1. The raw .cel file generated through above procedure meant expression intensity data and was used for the next step. 	For the normalization, Affymetrix microarray suite 5(MAS5) algorithm implemented in Affymetrix Expression Console software(version1.1) was used.
