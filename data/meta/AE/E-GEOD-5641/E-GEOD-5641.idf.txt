Experiment Description	The aim is to study the function of peroxisomal NAD-malate dehydrogenase in fatty acid beta-oxidation, glyoxylate cycle and photorespiration. Both peroxisomal MDH genes (At2g22780 and At5g09660) have been knocked out with T-DNA insertions and a double mutant made. Double mutant seedlings are blocked in beta-oxidation - they are 2,4DB resistant and beta-oxidation genes are repressed. They carry out glyoxylate cycle as normal. Plants grow well in soil and produce seed. Microarray analysis will tell us the extent of changes in gene expression in the mutant. For microarray analysis seeds are stratified at 4 C on agar medium with 1/2 strength M&S salts and 1% sucrose for 2 days, then seedlings grown for 2 days at 20 C in the light (100 umol/m2/s). Triplicate samples will be grown for mutant and wild type (col-0) and RNA isolated from each.
