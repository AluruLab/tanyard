Investigation Title	Identifying Y candidate genes						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Identifying Y candidate genes						
Experiment Description	The circadian clock generates biological rhythms with a period of approximately 24 hours. Using microarray experiments, we have previously shown that approximately 16% of the Arabidopsis genome is regulated in a circadian manner (Edwards et al., 2006). Previous work from our lab in modelling the molecular oscillator of Arabidopsis introduced a hypothetical component Y into an evening loop of the clock gene network (Locke et al., 2005). GIGANTEA (GI) was suggested as a strong candidate for Y based on genetic evidence and its close matching of the expression profile predicted by the mathematical modelling. Recent experimental evidence suggests that GI may only partially account for the function of Y. Thus, we are undertaking a genomics approach to identify other candidate genes that match the predicted expression profile of Y. Samples were taken from wild type and lhy cca1 double mutant seedlings from 4 timepoints around the night to day transition (-15mins, +15mins, +30mins and +60mins) after 9 days of growth in 18:6 light dark cycles. We aim to identify genes showing the light induction response predicted for Y around dawn. 16 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	Seedlings were grown for 9 days at 22degC on MS media in sealed petri-dishes under 18h:6h Light:Dark cycles of 60-65 uEINSTEINS cool white fluorescent light. Samples were taken at time intervals relative to time zero at dawn on the 9th day of growth.	Labelled using protocol described in manual &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual&quot;, One-Cycle target labelling	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
