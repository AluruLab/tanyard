Protocol Description	"Wild-type Arabidopsis plants, ecotype Columbia, were grown in soil in a plant growth room with 16-h-light (80uE light fluence rate) and 8-h-dark cycle at 20 oC and 40% humidity. After 5 to 6 weeks, plants were sprayed with 100 uM ABA or with water 4h before cell isolation at the same time of day, after 1h light, to eliminate variation as a result of diurnal changes in gene expression."	5-6 week old Arabidopsis plants were sprayed with 100uM ABA or water after 1 h light in the morning. Guard cell protoplasts and mesophyll cell protoplasts were isolated simultaneously four hours after the treatment. 	"Total RNA was extracted from guard cell or mesophyll protoplasts using the Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. Where indicated, to prevent changes of gene expression during protoplast isolation, two different transcription inhibitors, actinomycin D (33 mg/L) and cordycepin (100 mg/L), were used in all procedures of the isolation, including the first step of blending."
