In addition, all array data were processed to calculate the robust multi-array average (RMA) (Irizarry et al., 2003) using AFFY (Gautier et al., 2004). Expression values were computed by applying the RMA model of probespecific correction to perfect-match probes. These corrected probe values were then subjected to quantile normalization (Bolstad et al., 2003). The resulting RMA expression values were log2  ransformed.
