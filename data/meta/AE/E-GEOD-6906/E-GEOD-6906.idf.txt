Experiment Description	Plant hypocotyls elongate in response to darkness.  The response to darkness is gated by the circadian clock, such that wild-type plants (Col) only respond to darkness with growth once every 24 hours, whereas arrhythmic lines, such as CCA1-34, will respond to darkness with growth at any time of day.  The experiment here was designed to find genes whose expression was correlated with growth. It should also pick up other genes that are gated by the circadian clock or that are direct targets of CCA1. Experiment Overall Design: Two genotypes were uses, wild-type (Col) and the arrhythmic CCA1-34 line that overexpresses the CCA1 protein.  Plants were entrained in short day conditions for four days and then subjected light/dark pulses consisting of 160 minutes of light and 320 minutes of dark.  We collected samples 120 minutes into the first and last dark periods of the day, corresponding to 280 and 1240 minutes after dawn.  At the 280 minute time point Col plants are growing in response to darkness.  At the 1240 minute time point Col plants are not growing.  CCA1-34 plants are growing at both time points.  The collection regime was continued for three days for a total of three temporal replicates for each time point/genotype combination.

Protocol Description	About 100 seedlings were grown on a filter paper laid on 1xMSMO, 3% sucrose, 0.9% agar (Cat # A1296, Sigma) in 6 cm round Petri dishes.  Seeds were stratified for four days at 4 ËC and then incubated for four days at 20ËC under short day (8 hours light: 16 hours dark) conditions.  The Petri dishes were tilted about 30Ë from vertical in a growth chamber equipped with red and blue LEDs (70.7 Â&#956;E red light and 15.3 Â&#956;E blue light).  Starting from subjective dawn at day five, cycles of 160 min light and 320 min dark were given for three days.  This sample was collected 1240 minutes after subjective dawn on the fifth day; 120 minutes after lights-off.

This sample was collected 280 minutes after subjective dawn on the fifth day; 120 minutes after lights-off.	Samples were transferred to 1.5 ml tube and immediately frozen by liquid nitrogen and stored at â"80ËC.  Samples were collected using infra-red (IR) goggles (Night Vision model NCB4, Night Owl Optics, NY) to avoid light exposure.  100 mg frozen tissue samples were ground by pestle and electric motor.  Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, CA).	Samples were transferred to 1.5 ml tube and immediately frozen by liquid nitrogen and stored at â"80ËC.
