Investigation Title	Biological function of Pip3					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Biological function of Pip3					
Experiment Description	Ralstonia solanacearum is the causal agent of bacterial wilt. Arabidopsis thaliana monogenic resistance to the strain GMI1000 is conferred by the RRS1-R gene, present in the resistant ecotype ND-1 and absent in the susceptible ecotype Col-0. The corresponding protein is recognized by the avirulence protein PopP2 of R. solanacearum. In order to identify the plant proteins involved in the PopP2/RRS1-R perception complex, the screening of a root cDNA library in yeast was performed using PopP2 as bait. One interactor found was called Pip3, and we would like to better understand its biological function. Thereby we choose to compare two RNAi lines with their wild type Nd-1 background, and one KO line with its wild type Col-0 background. Also, two overexpressor lines will be compared with their wilt type Nd-1 background and two with their Col-0 background. 27 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	Labelled using protocol described in manual &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual&quot;, One-Cycle target labelling	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
