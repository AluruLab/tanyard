Samples were harvested at 0 (prior to treatment) , 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours post treatment.  A subset of these samples were processed. Arabidopsis plants grown in parallel under standardized conditions were treated with SA + Silwet or Silwet alone (control).  Only mature leaves of the same developmental age were harvested using leaves from 2-4 plants, totalling ~0.2 grams per sample.  Plants were not resampled.  In our hands, experimental replicates are highly reproducible.  This was an exploratory experiment to look for candidate genes impacted by exogenous SA treatment.  We were only able to process a subset of samples and chose to process key time points, sacrificing replicates at each time point."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Mary C Wildermuth","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Mary C Wildermuth","role":"submitter","email":"mwildermuth@berkeley.edu"},{"contact":"Jennifer Harrower","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["3.5 wk"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"tissue","value":["mature leaf"]},{"category":"treatment","value":["12 hr post SA + Silwet","12 hr post Silwet","24 hr post SA + Silwet","3 hr post SA + Silwet","6 hr post SA + Silwet","6 hr post Silwet","none"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"TREATMENT","value":["12 hr post SA + Silwet","12 hr post Silwet","24 hr post SA + Silwet","3 hr post SA + Silwet","6 hr post SA + Silwet","6 hr post Silwet","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":7,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":380563,"accession":"P-GSE33402-8"},{"id":380561,"accession":"P-GSE33402-7"},{"id":380564,"accession":"P-GSE33402-6"},{"id":380562,"accession":"P-GSE33402-5"},{"id":380560,"accession":"P-GSE33402-4"},{"id":380566,"accession":"P-GSE33402-3"},{"id":380565,"accession":"P-GSE33402-2"},{"id":380559,"accession":"P-GSE33402-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":7,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":7,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":7,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":7,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":7,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":7,"isderived":0}]}]}}
