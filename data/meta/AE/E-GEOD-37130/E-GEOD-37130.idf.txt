Comment[Submitted Name]	Comparative transcriptome analysis of responses of Arabidopsis ecotypes to cold stress
Experiment Description	Transcriptional variation, also called expression level polymorphism (ELP), contributes to intra-specific phenotypic variation in many organisms. Differentially expressed transcripts are typically enriched for stress-related genes, suggesting that differences in response to the environment are a particularly common point of divergence among gentoypes. Analysis of ELPs also has been suggested as a way to assess unintended consequences of transgene introduction; however, it is important that interpretation of transcriptional changes be performed within the context of potential fitness effects.  In these studies we sought to examine differential gene expression in response to cold for two widely used Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes, C24 and Columbia (Col). Two Arabidopsis genotypes were grown in 1/2 MS plate. Forteen-day-old seedlings were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. There were two biological replicates for each genotype and cold treatment combination.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA-calculated log2 intensity	standard Affymetrix procedures	standard Affymetrix procedures	Total RNA was extracted and purified using QIAGEN-RNeasy Mini Kit according to guidelines specified by the manufacturer.	Seeds were planted on 1/2 MS plate and incubated at 23/18 degree growth chamber	One µg of total RNA was processed to produce biotinylated cRNA targets.	All the Affymetrix data files produced with Affymetrix GCOS software (*.CEL files) were analyzed using Bioconductor, a public source software for the analyses of genomic data rooted in the statistical computing environment R. The data were normalized by robust multioiarray normalization of probe-level data with RMA and analyzed using affylmGUI running on R software.
