To clarify how the status is involved in the regulation, we performed a microarray analysis using 3-week-old wild-type and KO-nudx19 leaves grown under normal light conditions. Wild-type and KO-nudx19 plants were grown on MS medium containing 3% sucrose in a growth chamber kept at 25°C during 16 h of light (100 µmol\/m2\/s) and at 22°C during 8 h of darkness for 1 week, and then transferred to and further grown on soil for 2 weeks in the same chamber. At 3 weeks, leaves were collected as samples for microarray analysis."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Takanori Maruta","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Shigeru Shigeoka","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Kazuya Yoshimura","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Takanori Maruta","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["3 weeks"]},{"category":"cultivar","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["KO-nudx19","wildtype"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["rosette leaves"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["KO-nudx19","wildtype"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1106676,"accession":"P-GSE64968-1"},{"id":1106682,"accession":"P-GSE64968-2"},{"id":1106679,"accession":"P-GSE64968-5"},{"id":1106678,"accession":"P-GSE64968-6"},{"id":1106680,"accession":"P-GSE64968-3"},{"id":1106681,"accession":"P-GSE64968-4"},{"id":1106677,"accession":"P-GSE64968-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0}]}]}}
