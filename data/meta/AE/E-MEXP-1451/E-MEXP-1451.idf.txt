Protocol Description	Arabidopsis seed (Col-0) was sown in sterilized potting soil (Sunshine LC1 mix; Sungro Horticulture, Bellevue, WA, USA) and grown in a growth chamber at 21°C under a 16-h light and 8-h dark cycle. 	Replum cells were laser captured from siliques at two developmental stages: two days after flowering (2DAF) and 5 DAF. 	Laser-captured replum cells were transferred to a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube with 20 ìl of extraction buffer (PicoPure RNA isolation kit; Arcturus Engineering). After incubation at 42°C for 30 min, up to 20 tubes of cells were pooled prior to RNA isolation. RNA was extracted from microdissected cells with the PicoPureTM RNA isolation kit.
