Comment[Submitted Name]	LEAFY target genes reveal a link between flower development and biotic stimulus response (III)							
Experiment Description	The transition from vegetative growth to flower formation is critical for the survival of flowering plants. The plant-specific transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) has central, evolutionarily conserved roles in this process, both in the formation of the first flower and later in floral patterning. We performed genome-wide binding and expression studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which LFY executes these roles. Our study reveals that LFY directs an intricate regulatory network in control of floral homeotic gene expression and, unexpectedly, controls the expression of genes regulating the response to external stimuli in Arabidopsis. We further show that LFY dampens responses to a bacterial MAMP (microbe-associated molecular pattern) and to pathogen challenge. Our findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the coordination of reproductive stage development and disease response programs in plants. Regulation of these distinct survival programs by a single transcription factor may ensure optimal allocation of plant resources for reproductive fitness. Expression array analysis used to identify genes differentially expressed upon LFY induction in 9-day-old shoot apices. Expression array analysis of 9-day-old 35S::LFY-GR dexamethasone-treated seedlings compared to 9-day-old WT dexamethasone-treated seedlings. Four biological replicate samples.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = log2 gcrma normalized signal intensities	Hybridization to the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 array was performed at the University of Pennsylvania Microarray Core Facility using standard Affymetrix protocols.	Seeds cold-treated for 7 days at 4°C were grown in inductive conditions (continuous light or 16 hour long-day light conditions) at 23°C at a fluence rate of 45 μmol/m2 sec on 0.5x Murashige and Skoog plates	Microarray data were processed using Bioconductor packages in R. Data were gcRMA normalized (Wu et al., 2004). Non-specific filtering was performed with the MAS5.0 algorithm for genes that were ‘Present’ in at least 2 of 4 arrays in at least one treatment group (genotype) (McClintick and Edenberg, 2006). Differentially expressed genes were identified using LIMMA (Smyth, 2004).	Scanning was performed at the University of Pennsylvania Microarray Core Facility using standard Affymetrix protocols.	35S::LFY-GR and WT seedlings were treated with 10uM dexamethasone, 0.1% ethanol, for 4 hours essentially as described (Wagner et al., 1999).	RNA was extracted from four independent pools of apices using TRI-Reagent followed by column purification (RNeasy kit; QIAGEN).	RNA was amplified and labeled using NuGEN's Ovation™ RNA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.
