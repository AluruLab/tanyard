However, because plants are confined to a growing environment, in general they require unique features to cope with heat stress. We have analyzed the function of a novel Hsp, heat-stress-associated 32-kD protein (Hsa32), which is highly conserved in land plants but absent in most other organisms. The gene responds to HS at the transcriptional level in moss, Arabidopsis, and rice. Like other Hsps, Hsa32 protein accumulates greatly in Arabidopsis seedlings after HS treatment. Disruption of Hsa32 by T-DNA insertion does not affect growth and development under normal conditions. However, the acquired thermotolerance in the knockout line was compromised following a long recovery period (> 24 h) after an acclimation HS treatment, when a severe HS challenge killed the mutant but not the wild-type plants, but no significant difference was observed if they were challenged within a short recovery period. Microarray analysis of the knockout mutant indicates that only the expression of Hsa32 was significantly altered in HS response. Taken together, our results suggest that Hsa32 is not required for the induction but maintenance of acquired thermotolerance.  This report provides direct evidence that a plant-specific Hsp plays an important role in thermotolerance."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Yee-yung Charng","role":"submitter","email":"yycharng@gate.sinica.edu.tw"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":16500991,"authors":"Yee-yung Charng,Hsiang-chin Liu,Nai-yu Liu,Fu-chiun Hsu,Swee-suak Ko","title":"Arabidopsis Hsa32, a novel heat shock protein, is essential for acquired thermotolerance during long recovery after acclimation.","issue":4,"pages":"1297-305","publication":"Plant Physiol","year":2006}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["Hsa32 knockout","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["shoot"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"EnvironmentalStress","value":["heat shock","none"]},{"name":"Genotype","value":["Hsa32 knockout","wild_type"]},{"name":"Temperature","value":["22 degree_C","37 degree_C"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":8,"legacy_id":13851999}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
