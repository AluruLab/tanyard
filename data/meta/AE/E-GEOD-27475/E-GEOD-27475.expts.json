Using microarray analysis, we identified a number of AP2\/ERF genes in Arabidopsis that are induced at different stages of hypoxia treatment. we performed microarray analysis to compare gene expression profiles of wild-type and AtERF73\/HRE1-RNAi20 upon normaxic or hypoxic condition, in which AtERF73\/HRE1 expression was severely knocked down. Arabidopsis Affymetrix GeneChip arrays were probed with RNAs isolated from roots of untreated plants (controls) and plants treated with hypoxia for 6 h."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Chin-Ying Yang","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Yang Chin-Ying","role":"submitter","email":"emily0318@yahoo.com.tw"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21398256,"authors":"Yang CY, Hsu FC, Li JP, Wang NN, Shih MC.","title":"The AP2\/ERF transcription factor AtERF73\/HRE1 modulates ethylene responses during hypoxia in Arabidopsis","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["14-d-old seedling"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["control","HRE1-RNAi20"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["HRE1-RNAi20","wild type"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["control","hypoxia"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":16,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1127633,"accession":"P-GSE27475-7"},{"id":1127634,"accession":"P-GSE27475-8"},{"id":1127636,"accession":"P-GSE27475-5"},{"id":1127635,"accession":"P-GSE27475-6"},{"id":1127639,"accession":"P-GSE27475-3"},{"id":1127637,"accession":"P-GSE27475-4"},{"id":1127632,"accession":"P-GSE27475-1"},{"id":1127638,"accession":"P-GSE27475-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0}]}]}}
