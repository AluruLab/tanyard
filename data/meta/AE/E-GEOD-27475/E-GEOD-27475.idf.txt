Investigation Title	Expression data from wild-type and AtERF73/HRE1 knock-down line under hypoxia in Arabidopsis seedlings							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from wild-type and AtERF73/HRE1 knock-down line under hypoxia in Arabidopsis seedlings							
Experiment Description	"To mimic natural flooding conditions, we have adopted an “open system” treatment, in which only roots are subjected to hypoxia treatment.  Using microarray analysis, we identified a number of AP2/ERF genes in Arabidopsis that are induced at different stages of hypoxia treatment. we performed microarray analysis to compare gene expression profiles of wild-type and AtERF73/HRE1-RNAi20 upon normaxic or hypoxic condition, in which AtERF73/HRE1 expression was severely knocked down. Arabidopsis Affymetrix GeneChip arrays were probed with RNAs isolated from roots of untreated plants (controls) and plants treated with hypoxia for 6 h."

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = <br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	"Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16.5 hr at 45C on GeneChip Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450."	All seeds were sterilized and kept for 3 d at 4ºC in the dark to break dormancy.  Seeds were germinated on 0.8% (w/v) agar plates containing 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) sucrose at pH5.7.  The plates were incubated at 22ºC under a 16-h light (81 μmol s-1 m-2)/8-h dark cycle in a growth chamber for 14 d.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 500.	GeneChips were scanned using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G	"For hypoxia treatment, 14-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings were pretreatment on the wet filter paper containing 1/2 MS solution supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) sucrose at pH5.7 for 1 hour in the dark then placed into a floating platform with roots dipped into 1/2 MS solution contain 0.5% (w/v) sucrose at pH5.7, which was constantly supplied with 3% (v/v) oxygen and 97% (v/v) nitrogen in the dark for the times indicated."	Total RNA samples were isolated from frozen tissue of Arabidopsis using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).	"Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 701021 Rev. 5, Affymetrix)."
