First strand cDNA was synthesized using 200 units of SuperScript™ II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 ºC for 2 hr. Second strand synthesis was performed  using a cocktail (10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 40 units DNA polymerase I, 2 units RNase H), with the second strand buffer (invitrogen) and incubated at 16 ºC for 2 hr, followed by another 5 min incubation at 16 ºC after adding 10 units T4 DNA polymerase  to each reaction.  The reaction was then terminated by 10 µL 0.5 M EDTA. The (ds)-cDNA product was further purified using an equal volume of phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, saturated with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0\/1 mM EDTA) on a phase lock gel and then precipitated  by adding 0.5 volume of RNase free 7.5 M NH4Ac and 2.5 volumes of –20 ºC RNase free 100% ethanol.  The purified cDNA was used as a template for generating biotinylated cRNA probes via BioArray™ High Yield™ RNA transcription labeling kit (T7) (Enzo) at 37 ºC for 5 hrs.
