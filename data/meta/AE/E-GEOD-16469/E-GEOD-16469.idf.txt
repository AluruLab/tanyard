Experiment Description	A key question in developmental biology is how cells exchange positional information for proper patterning during organ development. In plant roots the radial tissue organization is highly conserved with a central vascular cylinder in which two water conducting cell types, protoxylem and metaxylem, are patterned centripetally. We show that this patterning occurs through crosstalk between the vascular cylinder and the surrounding endodermis mediated by cell-to-cell movement of a transcription factor in one direction and microRNAs in the other. SHORT ROOT, produced in the vascular cylinder, moves into the endodermis to activate SCARECROW. Together these transcription factors activate MIR165a and 166b. Endodermally produced miR165/6 then acts to degrade its target mRNAs encoding class III homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factors in the endodermis and stele periphery. The resulting differential distribution of target mRNA in the vascular cylinder determines xylem cell types in a dosage dependent manner. To investigate the global regulation of SHR and SCR in the root, direct and indirect target genes of SHR and SCR were cross-compared with selected cell type specific expression profiles in the Arabidopsis root published in Birnbaum et al. (2003), Nawy et al. (2005), Lee et al. (2006), and Brady et al. (2007) [pubmed IDs: 14671301, 15937229, 16581911, 17975066].  Furthermore, the mature endodermis specific transcript profiles were generated using a GFP marker line, E30, and used together with published profiles in this comparison.

Protocol Description	Seeds were surface sterilized with 50% Bleach and 0.1% Tween for 5 minutes and then rinsed 3 times with sterile water. Seeds were stratified at 4ËC for 2 days before being planted on standard media. Standard media is 1X concentration Murashige and Skoog salt mixture (Caisson laboratories), 0.5g/L MES, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH. Nylon mesh was placed on top of the solidified media and seeds were evenly placed on the mesh in two rows. About 1cm long root tips were harvested and placed in the protoplast solution as described in Birnbaum et al. (2005) Nat. Methods. GFP expressing protoplasts  were isolated from Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter to collect total RNA.	Seedlings were grown vertically for 6 days at 22 degree under 16 hours of day and 8 hours of night.	RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH)	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared using the two-cycle amplification protocol by Affymetrix.	Samples were submitted to Expression Analysis Inc. (Durham, NC) for hybridization to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.	Samples were submitted to Expression Analysis Inc. (Durham, NC) for hybridization to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method.	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = signal intensity
