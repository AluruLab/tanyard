Experiment Description	Col-0 and WEE1KO (wee1-1 and wee1-2) were germinated on control medium on a nylon mesh and transferred 5 days after germination to medium supplemented with 2 mM HU. Samples were harvested at three different time points after transfer: 0 h, 5 h, and 24 h. All sampling points were performed in four independent experiments for Col-0, two independent experiments for wee1-1 and 2 independent experiments for wee1-2. For each time point in each experiment ﾱ50 root tips were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted from root tissue with TriZol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified with RNneasy kit (Qiagen). The RNA of two independent experiments for Col-0 and WEE1KO were subsequently pooled and used for<br>microarray analysis.

Protocol Description	Signal values were normalized using the gcRMA method with Bioconductor package in R. ata of the resulting FGEM file is represented in a log2-scale.	plants were grown for 7 days (2days of germination, 5 days of growth) vertically under continuous light conditions at 21ﾰC with 1x Murashige and Skoog medium (4.302 g/L), 10 g/L sucrose, 0.1 g/L myo-inositol, 0.5 g/L MES, 100 ?L thiamine hydrochloride (10 mg/mL), 100 ?L pyridoxine (5 mg/mL), 100 ?L nicotinic acid (5 mg/mL), pH 5.7 adjusted with 1 M KOH, 10 g/L agar. Seeds were put out on a nylon mesh (20 ?m pore size) (Prosep).<br>(Parameters: start time = 5, time unit = days, min temperature = 21, temperature unit = C)	Root tips were cut and preserved at -70ﾰC. After grinding of the samples, RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent and purified with RNeasy kit (Qiagen)<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Membranes were transferred to 1xMS medium, supplemented with 2mM HU for the designated amount of time (0h, 5h, 24h)
