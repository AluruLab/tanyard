A tight control of BR homeostasis is vital for modulating their impact on various growth responses. However, whilst it is recognized that the rapid adaptation of de novo synthesis plays a key role in adjusting required BR levels, our knowledge of the mechanisms governing feedback control is limited. We identified the transcription factor CESTA as a novel regulator of BR biosynthesis. ces-D was isolated in a screen of Arabidopsis mutants by BR over-accumulation phenotypes. Loss-of-function analysis and the use of a dominant repressor version revealed functional overlap among CESTA and its homologues and confirmed the role of these basic helix-loop-helix proteins in the positive control of BR biosynthetic gene expression. In this experiment we compare the transcriptome of the CESTA mutant to wild-type plants using the Affymetrix ATH1 array. 4 samples were used in this experiment."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Mamoona Khan","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":" Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC)","role":"submitter","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["14 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["1.04 (Boyes Key)"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["cesta enhancer trap","cesta knockout","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["cesta enhancer trap","cesta knockout","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":446491,"accession":"P-GSE20225-2"},{"id":446489,"accession":"P-GSE20225-1"},{"id":446493,"accession":"P-GSE20225-4"},{"id":446490,"accession":"P-GSE20225-3"},{"id":446495,"accession":"P-GSE20225-6"},{"id":446494,"accession":"P-GSE20225-5"},{"id":446492,"accession":"P-GSE20225-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0}]}]}}
