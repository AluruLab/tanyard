Investigation Title	CESTA transcript analysis						
Comment[Submitted Name]	CESTA transcript analysis						
Experiment Description	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid hormones that are essential for the development of plants. A tight control of BR homeostasis is vital for modulating their impact on various growth responses. However, whilst it is recognized that the rapid adaptation of de novo synthesis plays a key role in adjusting required BR levels, our knowledge of the mechanisms governing feedback control is limited. We identified the transcription factor CESTA as a novel regulator of BR biosynthesis. ces-D was isolated in a screen of Arabidopsis mutants by BR over-accumulation phenotypes. Loss-of-function analysis and the use of a dominant repressor version revealed functional overlap among CESTA and its homologues and confirmed the role of these basic helix-loop-helix proteins in the positive control of BR biosynthetic gene expression. In this experiment we compare the transcriptome of the CESTA mutant to wild-type plants using the Affymetrix ATH1 array. 4 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0-calculated signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Agilent 2500A GeneArray Scanner. Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	The plants were grown on ATS media incubated vertically for 14 days. The growth conditions were long day (16 hours of 50-100 µM/m²s white light, 8 hours dark). The temperature applied was 24°C +/- 1	Labelled using protocol described in manual &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual&quot;, One-Cycle target labelling	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using the MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system.
