Comment[Submitted Name]	Empty-vector control and transgenic 35S-PaWRKY1 Arabidopsis							
Experiment Description	Transcriptional profiling of genes regulated by PaWRKY1 transcription factor A PaWRKY transcription factor from orchid plants is expressed in Arabidopsis, and the PaWRKY-regulated genes are studied Comparison of empty-vector control and transgenic 35S-PaWRKY1 Arabidopsis Affymetrix GeneChip assay were performed by the Affymetrix Gene Expression Service Lab (http://ipmb.sinica.edu.tw/affy/), supported by Academia Sinica, Taiwan

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA normalized signal intensity	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16.5 hr at 45C on GeneChip ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	7 day old seedlings in full-strength MS	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 500. The data was further normalized by the RMA algorithm.	GeneChips were scanned using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G	Empty-vector control and transgenic PaWRKY1 Arabidopsis	Total RNA were extracted using QIAGEN RNeasy kit follwed by DNAse treatment. The RNA samples were further purified and concentrated by RNeasy MinElute Cleanup.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 701021 Rev. 5, Affymetrix).
