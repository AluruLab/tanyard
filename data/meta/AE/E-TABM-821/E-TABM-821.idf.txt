Protocol Description	Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized with bleach for one minute followed by five rinses in sterile distilled water and plated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) ( Murashige & Skoog, 1962) salts supplemented with 3% sucrose and 0.8% Bacto agar in Petri dishes.  Plates were incubated in a growth chamber (Percival Scientific, IO, USA) at 25ï¾&deg;C, with a photoperiod of 16h light/8h dark for germination.  To collect root exudates, seven-day-old seedlings were transferred to 6-well culture plates (VWR Scientific), each well containing 5 ml of liquid MS (MS basal salts supplemented with 1% sucrose), incubated on an orbital shaker at 90 rpm and illuminated under cool white fluorescent light (45 ï¾&#956;mol m-2 s-1) with a photoperiod of 16h light/8h dark at 25ï¾&deg;C. According to previously-published methods (Loyola-Vargas et al., 2007; Badri et al., 2008) when plants were 18 days old, they were washed with sterile water to remove the surface-adhering exudates and transferred to new 6-well plates containing 5 ml MS liquid media and incubated on an orbital shaker at 90 rpm and illuminated under cool white fluorescent light (45 ï¾&#956;mol m-2 s-1) with a photoperiod of 16h light/8h dark at 25ï¾&deg;C. The root tissue was collected from 20 day old seedlings.	Total RNA extration from root tissues were done by using Trizol regant	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
