Plates were incubated in a growth chamber (Percival Scientific, IO, USA) at 25ï¾°C, with a photoperiod of 16h light\/8h dark for germination.  To collect root exudates, seven-day-old seedlings were transferred to 6-well culture plates (VWR Scientific), each well containing 5 ml of liquid MS (MS basal salts supplemented with 1% sucrose), incubated on an orbital shaker at 90 rpm and illuminated under cool white fluorescent light (45 ﾼmol m-2 s-1) with a photoperiod of 16h light\/8h dark at 25ï¾°C. According to previously-published methods (Loyola-Vargas et al., 2007; Badri et al., 2008) when plants were 18 days old, they were washed with sterile water to remove the surface-adhering exudates and transferred to new 6-well plates containing 5 ml MS liquid media and incubated on an orbital shaker at 90 rpm and illuminated under cool white fluorescent light (45 ﾼmol m-2 s-1) with a photoperiod of 16h light\/8h dark at 25ï¾°C. The root tissue was collected from 20 day old seedlings.","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null}]}}
