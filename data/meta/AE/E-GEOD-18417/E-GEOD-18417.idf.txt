Investigation Title	Arabidopsis transcriptome changes caused by ectopic production of a turtle riboflavin-binding protein							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Arabidopsis transcriptome changes caused by ectopic production of a turtle riboflavin-binding protein							
Experiment Description	Leaf contents of free riboflavin were modulated by ectopic expression of the turtle gene encoding riboflavin-binding protein (RfBP). Compared to Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) ecotype Col-0 (wild type), REAT (modified type) that constitutive express RfBP had 71%-77% less flavins of free form.  We used microarray to investigate the influence on plants due to the reduced free flavin. One modified line (REAT11) and wild type (WT) were tested by microarray, and the experiments data revealed that abundance of transcripts for 950 genes in REAT was altered compared to the wild type. Four samples were analyzed. Two WT and two REAT11 biological replicates were analyzed (one array each).

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Signal<br>ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Following fragmentation, 15 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45 ℃ on GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	For 35 d before use, wild type and transgenic plants grow in controlled environment chambers with 75% humidity and a 14-h-day (200 μE m−2 s−1 at 24°C) and 10-h-night (20°C) cycle.	The data were analyzed with GeneChip® Operating Software using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method.	GeneChips were scanned using the Gene array Scanner3000 7G.	Without treatment before RNA extraction.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
