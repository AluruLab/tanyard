For microarray analysis, Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) seedlings grew in four types of sterile growth medium: no any other modifying agents, added 7g\/ml 0.5 M aza-dC in water (DNA methylation inhibitor), added TSA in methanol (histone deacetylation inhibitor), both aza-dC and TSA, all for 16 day in growth chamber (16-h day length at 70% relative humidity, 23 °C) , then all seedlings were cold treated at 0 °C for 24 h in growth chamber (16-h day length at 70% relative humidity). A total of 3305 genes expression were statistically analysized. Our study provides some clues that the transcript levels of some cold-responsive genes regulated by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. This will be valuable for understanding gene regulation by epigenetic modifications under freezing stress.  Keywords: Cold Stress response, DNA methylation, histone deacetylation Three replicates for aza-dc and TSA treatment, and two replicates for Mock and both aza-dc and TSA treatment. All samples were treated 0°C 24h."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Lining Tian","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Yuan Song","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Yuan Song","role":"submitter","email":"songyuan@lzu.edu.cn"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedlings"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":10,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1108292,"accession":"P-GSE63131-4"},{"id":1108290,"accession":"P-GSE63131-5"},{"id":1108293,"accession":"P-GSE63131-2"},{"id":1108291,"accession":"P-GSE63131-3"},{"id":1108287,"accession":"P-GSE63131-1"},{"id":1108288,"accession":"P-GSE63131-7"},{"id":1108289,"accession":"P-GSE63131-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":10,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":10,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":10,"isderived":0}]}]}}
