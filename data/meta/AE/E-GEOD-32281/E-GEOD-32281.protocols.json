The subsequent cDNA was cleaned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup kit (Millenium Sciences cat no. 900371). Upon cleaning of the cDNA the next step was to incorporate biotin into the resultant cRNA using the Affymetrix IVT labelling kit (Millenium Sciences cat no. 900449). After the IVT process the labelled cRNA was cleaned using the above GeneChip Sample Cleanup kit. The quantity of product was ascertained using the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 using the NanoChip protocol. A total of 20ug of labelled cRNA was then fragmented to the 50-200bp size range and quality control checked using the Bioanalyser 2100 using the NanoChip protocol. Samples that pass this checkpoint are then prepared for hybridisation to the GeneChip by preparing a probe cocktail (cRNA @ 0.05ug\/ul) that includes 1x Hybridisation Buffer (100mM MES, 1m NaCl, 20mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween-20), 0.1mg\/ml Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5mg\/ml BSA, and 7% DMSO.","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":713873,"accession":"P-GSE32281-5","name":"P-GSE32281-5","text":"A total hybridisation volume of 300ul is prepared for each sample and 200ul loaded into a GeneChip.
