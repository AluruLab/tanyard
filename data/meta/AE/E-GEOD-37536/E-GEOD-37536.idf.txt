Comment[Submitted Name]	Genome wide identification of ORE1 early target genes
Experiment Description	Global transcriptome patterns were performed using ORE1-IOE-2h (2h after Estradiol and Mock treatment) as well as transiently (6h) overexpressed Arabidopsis mesophyll cell protoplasts To identify genes more rapidly responding to elevated ORE1 expression we here repeated the previous experiment (Balazadeh et al., 2010), but shortened the EST induction time to 2 h (ORE1-IOE-2h dataset). Furthermore, to exclude potential misinterpretation due to EST treatment we also included an experiment where we transiently expressed a 35S::ORE1 construct in Arabidopsis mesophyll cell protoplasts and extracted RNA 6 h after the transfection (35S::ORE1-6h dataset);

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = rma normalized	Labelling, hybridisation, washing, staining, and scanning procedures were performed by an Affymetrix authorized service provider (ATLAS Biolabs, Berlin, Germany) as described in the Affymetrix technical manual	IOE: Seeds were surface-sterilized for 1 min in 70% ethanol and then in sterilisation solution (20% sodium hypochlorite) for 30 min. After sterilization, the seeds were sown on half-strength MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962), supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose and solidified with 0.7% (w/v) phytoagar and appropriate antibiotics. After imbibition, the seeds were stratified at 4∞C for 3 days. The seeds were germinated at 22∞C under a 16-h day (140 µmol m-2 s-1) / 8-h night regime. The two-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings were carefully removed from plates subjected to Est/Mocktreatments. Plants used for protoplast preparation: Col-0 seeds were directly sown on soil and plants were grown under long day (16 h light / 8 h dark) conditions.	Raw data (CEL files) obtained from RNA hybridisation experiments were normalized with the affyPLM package from the Bioconductor software project (Gentleman et al., 2004) using the GCRMA that uses GC content of probes in normalization with RMA (Robust Multiple array Average) and gives one value for each probe set instead of keeping probe level information (Wu et al., 2004). The transcriptional changes were determined by subtracting the normalized signal intensity of the control samples from that of induced samples.	Labelling, hybridisation, washing, staining, and scanning procedures were performed by an Affymetrix authorized service provider (ATLAS Biolabs, Berlin, Germany) as described in the Affymetrix technical manual	After two weeks, seedlings were transferred to MS liquid medium while shaking. Œ≤-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 10 ŒºM. Subsequently, seedlings were harvested at 2h after estradiol addition.	RNeasy Plant Mini Kit	Labelling, hybridisation, washing, staining, and scanning procedures were performed by an Affymetrix authorized service provider (ATLAS Biolabs, Berlin, Germany) as described in the Affymetrix technical manual
