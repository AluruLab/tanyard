Experiment Description	Comparison of mp mutant seedlings with transgenics carrying a dexamethasone-inducible GR-bodenlos gene. Seedlings were pretreated with control medium or medium containing dexamethasone, followed by a 1 hour auxin treatment, and expression profiles were compared using Affymetrix ATH1 arrays.
