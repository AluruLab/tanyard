Probe intensity data from the GeneChips were processed in a three-stage procedure using Robust Multichip Average (RMA) and Bolstad’s algorithms (Bolstad, 2004). For this analysis a pre-processing RMA background correction method, a quantile normalization (Irizarry et al., 2003) and RMA’s median polish summarization methods were used. Expression levels are based on log2 values.","type":"feature_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null}]}}
