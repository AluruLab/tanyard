Experiment Overall Design: Red coloured 35S:PAP1, and empty vector control, plants of Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia were grown under room temperature, high light (RTHL, 22°C, 440 µmol m-2 s-1 irradiance) conditions to promote red leaf colouration. The growth conditions were then changed to a high day temperature, low light (HTLL: 30°C day, 150 µmol m-2 s-1 irradiance) stress treatment for six days, during which time the 35S:PAP1 leaves lost much of their red colouration, turning green.  The growth conditions were then returned to a low temperature high light (LTHL, 15°C, 62% RH, 440 µmol m-2 s-1 irradiance) regime to restore the red colouration."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Mingshu Cao","role":"submitter","email":"DRowan@hortresearch.co.nz Mingshu.Cao@agresearch.co.nz"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19192188,"authors":"Rowan DD, Cao M, Lin-Wang K, Cooney JM, Jensen DJ, Austin PT, Hunt MB, Norling C, Hellens RP, Schaffer RJ, Allan AC.","title":"Environmental regulation of leaf colour in red 35S:PAP1 Arabidopsis thaliana.","doi":"10.1111\/j.1469-8137.2008.02737.x","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["35S::PAP1","empty Ti plasmid"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["35S::PAP1","empty Ti plasmid"]},{"name":"SAMPLING TIME POINT","value":["1 days","12 days","2 days","7 days","8 days"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":10,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":451807,"accession":"P-G13469-2"},{"id":451808,"accession":"P-G13469-1"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":10,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":10,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":10,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
