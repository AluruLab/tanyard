Protocol Description	Seedlings were sown on moistend Metro Mix 350 media.  They were the covered with a clear plastic lid (to retain humidity) and stratafied for 48 hours at 4C.  They were then placed at 22C in a Percival model AR66L growth chamber with full lighting.  After two to three days the cover was removed and plants were sub-irrigated with deionized water as needed.	On day 14 after germination plants were moved from the Percival chamber and placed in the dark in another chamber set at 0C.  They were kept there for 24 hours then harvested and stored at -80C until used for RNA extraction.	Plants were grown the entire time at 22C in a Percival model AR66L chamber.	Total RNA extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerÂ’s instructions and purified with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).  	Populations from several pots were pooled to obtain sufficient material.  	followed manufacturer's manual. http://www.affymetrix.com/support/downloads/manuals/expression_s21_manual.pdf	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol.
