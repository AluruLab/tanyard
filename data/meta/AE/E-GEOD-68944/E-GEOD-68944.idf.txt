Investigation Title	Expression data from sound treated Arabidopsis thaliana						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from sound treated Arabidopsis thaliana
Experiment Description	Sound wave can cause various developmental and physiological changes in plant. It strongly suggests the existence of sophisticated molecular mechanisms for sound perception in plant. Hence gene expression study is important. We investigated the global gene expression in Arabidopsis upon five different single frequency treatment. Sound treated Arabidopsis was used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Five different frequency (250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz) was applied at 80 db on 20 days old plant for one hour. Immediate after treatment (0 hour) rosette samples were harvested.

Protocol Description	Expression data were generated by Affymetrix Expression Console software version1.1. For the normalization, RMA (Robust Multi-Average) algorithm implemented in Affymetrix Expression Console software was used. To reduce noise for the significance analysis, probe sets that were not present by the MAS5 detection call in over 50% of the samples in at least one sample group were filtered out. ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA(Robust Multi-array Average) Normalization	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChipÂ® arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	20 days old Arabidopsis plants were transferred to noiseless chamber and subjected to different frequency (250Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz, 2000Hz, and 3000Hz) of sound wave at 80 dB for 1 hour. Control sample was kept in the same noisless chamber without sound for 1 hr.	Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Columbia (Col-0) plants were grown under continuous light (~150Â±10 Âµmol m-2 s-1) at 22C in growth room. Seeds were stratified in cold (4C) and dark for 2 days.	Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerâs instruction.	GeneChips were scanned using the Genechip Array scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).
