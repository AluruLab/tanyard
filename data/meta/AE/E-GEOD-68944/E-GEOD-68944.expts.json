It strongly suggests the existence of sophisticated molecular mechanisms for sound perception in plant. Hence gene expression study is important. We investigated the global gene expression in Arabidopsis upon five different single frequency treatment. Sound treated Arabidopsis was used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Five different frequency (250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz) was applied at 80 db on 20 days old plant for one hour. Immediate after treatment (0 hour) rosette samples were harvested."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Ritesh Ghosh","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Ritesh Ghosh","role":"submitter","email":"riteshghosh08@gmail.com"},{"contact":"Hanhong Bae","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Bosung Choi","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["20 days"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["rossette"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1232933,"accession":"P-GSE68944-2"},{"id":1232928,"accession":"P-GSE68944-1"},{"id":1232934,"accession":"P-GSE68944-4"},{"id":1232932,"accession":"P-GSE68944-3"},{"id":1232930,"accession":"P-GSE68944-6"},{"id":1232931,"accession":"P-GSE68944-5"},{"id":1232929,"accession":"P-GSE68944-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0}]}]}}
