Investigation Title	Early Iron Deficiency Induced Changes in Arabidopsis Roots					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Early Iron Deficiency Induced Changes in Arabidopsis Roots					
Experiment Description	Due to limited bio-availability of Fe, plants evolved adaptive alterations in development regulated at the transcriptional level. We investigated the early transcriptional response to Fe deficiency. A hydroponic system was used that allows bulk transferring of plantsand rapid Fe removal with little mechanical damage to the root systems.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = <br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Array was scanned with use of the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 7G.	Ten microgram labeled samples were hybridized to the ATH1 Genome Array at 45â„ƒ for 16.5 h. Washing and staining involved Fluidic Station-450 and the ATH1 Genome.	Total RNA was extracted with Qiagen RNeasy mini kit.	Ten microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis, labeled by in vitro transcription, followed by fragmentation according to the manufacturer's suggestion (GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual rev5, Affymetrix)	The results were quantified and analyzed by use of MicroArray Suite 5.0 software (Affymetrix Inc.).
