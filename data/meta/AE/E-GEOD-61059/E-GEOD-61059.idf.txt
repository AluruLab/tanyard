Comment[Submitted Name]	Gated SA effect on transcriptome						
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis seedlings treated with salycilic acid at ZT24 (subjective morning) or ZT36 (evening)						
Experiment Description	We used microarrays to identify genes that respond to salycilic acid (SA) differently during the subjective morning and subjective night. 23-day-old wild type Arabidopsis seedlings. 24 samples total. Three biological replicates were used

Protocol Description	The data were normalized with RMA algorithm using Gene-Spring GX default analysis settings ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA signal intensity	RNA probes were labelled using the Ambion MessageAmp Premier.	aRNA were hybridized to GeneChip®in Affymetrix GeneChip® hybridization oven 645, washed in Affymetrix GeneChip® Fluidics Station 450	23-day-old wild type treated with water or 1 mM SA at ZT24 or ZT36. Three biological replicates were used.	Arabidopsis seedlings were grown at 21-24°C, 12-hour day length, 60% relative humidity. The seedlings were transfer to constant light condition for 24 hours before treatment and left in constant light condition after treatment	Total RNA was isolated from the frozen material using Invitrogen TRIzol.	GeneChips were scanned using Affymetrix GeneChip® Scanner 7G
