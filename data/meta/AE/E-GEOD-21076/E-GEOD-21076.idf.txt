Experiment Description	We used Arabidopsis full-genome microarrays to characterize plant transcript accumulations at different stages of infection with the biotrophic oomycete downy mildew pathogen, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis : initiation  (< 1 dpi) and maintenance of infection (> 4 dpi). In two independent experiments, cotyledons from the ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) were inoculated with water, or with Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis to establish a compatible interaction. Affymetrix  ATH1 microarrays were used to profile Arabidopsis transcript accumulations at the initiation (mixed samples at 8 and 24 hours post inoculation, hpi; early stage) and maintenance (mixed samples at 4 and 6 days post inoculation; late stage) of the compatible interaction.

Protocol Description	Seeds from A. thaliana ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) were sown on a soil/sand mixture, stratified for 3 days at 4 Â°C, and then grown under a 12 h photoperiod in a growth chamber at 20 Â°C.	In two independent experiments, cotyledons from the ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) were inoculated with water, or with H. arabidopsidis to establish a compatible interaction. Total RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin Plant RNA preparation kit according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Macherey-Nagel, Hoerd, France). Equal amounts of RNA extracted at 8 h and 24 h after inoculation were mixed to produce the âearlyâ interaction samples. Equal amounts of RNA from cotyledons at 4 d and 6 d after inoculation were mixed to produce the âlateâ interaction samples.	For infection, 10-day-old plants were spray-inoculated to saturation with a spore suspension of 40,000 spores/ml (strain  Emwa1)	Hybridized probes were labeled with streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate and anti streptavidine antibody,	RNA samples from the âearlyâ and âlateâ compatible interaction, and from the water-treated control (5 Âµg each) were submitted to hybridizations on Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity
