Experiment Description	"Arabidopsis thaliana seeds after imbibition were inoculated in ½ MS medium supplemented with 0.8% agar and 1% sucrose. Once the plant material was uniformly germinated, the experimental conditions were applied. 5d old light-grown uniformly germinated seedlings were washed seven times with sterile water with last wash given by ½ MS liquid medium without sucrose to remove residual exogenous sugar and the plant material was kept in ½ MS liquid without sucrose in the dark for all subsequent steps. Cultures were shaken at 140 rpm at 22oC for 24 h and then 3 h treatment was given with liquid ½ MS without glucose and liquid ½ MS supplemented with BR (0.1 ?M EBR), glucose (3%), glucose (3%) + BR (0.1 ?M EBR). Seedlings were harvested after 3h and preceded for RNA isolation and Microarray analysis."

The imbibed seeds were germinated and grown vertically on Petri dishes containing 0.5x Murashige and Skoog (Sigma) supplemented with 1% sucrose and solidified with 0.8% Agar (Hi Media). Seed germination was carried out in climate-controlled growth rooms in a long day condition (16 h light and 8 h darkness), except stated otherwise, with 22oC±2oC temperature and 80?mol m-2 s-1 light intensity. <br>(Parameters: start time = 6, time unit = days, min temperature = 22, max temperature = 24, temperature unit = C, media = 1/2 MS)"	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
