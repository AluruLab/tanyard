Once the plant material was uniformly germinated, the experimental conditions were applied. 5d old light-grown uniformly germinated seedlings were washed seven times with sterile water with last wash given by ½ MS liquid medium without sucrose to remove residual exogenous sugar and the plant material was kept in ½ MS liquid without sucrose in the dark for all subsequent steps. Cultures were shaken at 140 rpm at 22oC for 24 h and then 3 h treatment was given with liquid ½ MS without glucose and liquid ½ MS supplemented with BR (0.1 ?M EBR), glucose (3%), glucose (3%) + BR (0.1 ?M EBR). Seedlings were harvested after 3h and preceded for RNA isolation and Microarray analysis."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Ashverya Laxmi","role":"submitter","email":"ashverya_laxmi@nipgr.res.in"}],"bibliography":[{"title":"Genome wide Analysis of Glucose and Brassinosteroid Signaling Interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["6 day"]},{"category":"biosource type","value":["frozen_sample"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"initial time point","value":["beginning_of_stage"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["0.1% epibrassinolide","3% glucose","3% glucose; 0.1% epibrassinolide","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":845750,"accession":"P-MTAB-14179"},{"id":844799,"accession":"P-MTAB-14180"},{"id":844798,"accession":"P-MTAB-14181"},{"id":77,"accession":"P-AFFY-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
