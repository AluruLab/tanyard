Experiment Description	The transcriptome of the three atino80 allelic mutants was compared to that of wild-type and 50B Arabidopsis plants (see Fritsch et al. 2004). Since the transcriptomes of 50B and wild-type plants were found to be identical, we compared expression in the mutant with 50B and with wild-type without distinction. Therefore, we had four replicates of the wild type condition (50B line, wild-type) and two replicates for each of the mutant alleles (atino80-1, atino80-2 and atino80-3), all ecotype Columbia. All lines were profiled in duplicate (grown independently at 2-week-intervals).

Protocol Description	All lines were profiled in duplicate (grown independently at 2-week-intervals). All seeds were coming from plant individuals grown in the same growth room and at the same time. In vitro growth was achieved in growth chamber at 16 h light/8 h dark cycles with 21°C during the day and 16°C during the night with temperature regulated shelves. Seeds were surface sterilized by 2 min incubation in 70% ethanol followed by 10 min incubation in bleach solution (7% hypochlorite bleach (technical grade), 0.05% TWEEN-80) with occasional mixing. The seeds were then rinsed 2 or 3 times with sterile double-distilled water and resuspended in 0.08 % liquid agar (DIFCO Bacto-Agar) for easy plating. Seeds were germinated on agar plates containing MS medium (Duchefa) in growth chamber after 2 days at 4°C in the dark for stratification. One-week-old plants were transferred to two new plates with a density of 25 plants for a 9 cm diameter dish. After one more week in the growth chamber samples were harvested 1 h after the light switched on.	Total RNA extraction from frozen plant material. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy plant extraction kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturers instructions. For one isolation, about 50-to-100 mg of liquid nitrogen-frozen material with 450 µl of the provided RLT buffer (with â-mercaptoethanol) were grinded with one tungsten bead in a MixerMill robot for 90 sec at maximum speed. The rest of the extraction was done according to the provided instructions. After elution, the yield was estimated by OD measurement and the RNA was precipitated and resuspended in an appropriate volume to reach a final concentration of RNA of 1.5 µg.µl-1	A pool of 25 individual plants was consituted by randomly picking plants from the two plates. Pooled plants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C until the extraction	10 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript Choice system for cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies) according to the protocol recommended by Affymetrix. The oligonucleotide used for priming was 5?-ggccagtgaattgtaatacgactcactatagggaggcgg-(t)24-3? (Genset Oligo). Double-stranded cDNA was cleaned by phenol:chloroform extraction and the aqueous phase removed by centrifugation through Phase-lock Gel (Eppendorf). In vitro transcription was performed on 1 µg of cDNA using the Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labelling kit (Enzo Diagnostics). The cRNA was cleaned using RNAeasy clean-up columns (Qiagen). The cRNA was fragmented by heating in 40 mM Tris-acetate pH 8.1, 100 mM KOAc, 30 mM MgOAc.	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL Analysis (Percentile).
