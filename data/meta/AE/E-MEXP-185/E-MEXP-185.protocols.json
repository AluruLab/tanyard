All seeds were coming from plant individuals grown in the same growth room and at the same time. In vitro growth was achieved in growth chamber at 16 h light\/8 h dark cycles with 21°C during the day and 16°C during the night with temperature regulated shelves. Seeds were surface sterilized by 2 min incubation in 70% ethanol followed by 10 min incubation in bleach solution (7% hypochlorite bleach (technical grade), 0.05% TWEEN-80) with occasional mixing. The seeds were then rinsed 2 or 3 times with sterile double-distilled water and resuspended in 0.08 % liquid agar (DIFCO Bacto-Agar) for easy plating. Seeds were germinated on agar plates containing MS medium (Duchefa) in growth chamber after 2 days at 4°C in the dark for stratification. One-week-old plants were transferred to two new plates with a density of 25 plants for a 9 cm diameter dish. After one more week in the growth chamber samples were harvested 1 h after the light switched on.","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null,"parameter":["max temperature","min temperature"]},{"id":418791,"accession":"P-MEXP-5498","name":"P-MEXP-5498","text":"A pool of 25 individual plants was consituted by randomly picking plants from the two plates.
