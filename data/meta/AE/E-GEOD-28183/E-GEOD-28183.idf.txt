Investigation Title	Expression data in double knockout of HsfA1d and HsfA1e Arabidopsis mutants (KO-HsfA1d/A1e) at 30 min under high-light stress							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data in double knockout of HsfA1d and HsfA1e Arabidopsis mutants (KO-HsfA1d/A1e) at 30 min under high-light stress
Experiment Description	The transcript levels of 560 genes were decreased (less than two-fold), while those of 312 genes were increased (more than two-fold) in the KO-HsfA1d/A1e plants compared with the wild-type plants.  The transcript levels of  HsfA2, HsfA7a, HsfA7b, HsfB1, and HsfB2a were down-regulated in the KO-HsfA1d/A1e Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia plants were grown (16 h light, 25°C/8 h dark, 22°C) on MS medium under a light intensity of 100 µE m-2 sec-1.  Two-week-old seedlings were subjected to high-light stress (400 µE m-2 sec-1, 25°C).

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Expression ConsoleTM Version 1.1 signal intensity	Following fragmentation, 12.5 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45℃ on GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	The wild-type plants and KO-HsfA1d/A1e mutants were grown (16 h light, 25°C/8 h dark, 22°C) on MS medium under a light intensity of 100 µE m-2 sec-1.	The data were analyzed with Expression ConsoleTM Version 1.1 using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.	Two-week-old seedlings were subjected to light intensity stress (400 µE m-2 sec-1, 25°C) for 30 min.	Sepasol-RNA I extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 100 ng total RNA (GeneChip 3'IVT Express User Manual, Affymetrix).
