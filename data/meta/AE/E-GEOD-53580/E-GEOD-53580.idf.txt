Investigation Title	Expression data from Arabidopsis C3H14/15 overexpressors, c3h14c3h15 double mutant vs wild type						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis C3H14/15 overexpressors, c3h14c3h15 double mutant vs wild type						
Experiment Description	In plants, CCCH zinc finger proteins involved in secondary wall formation and anther development are poorly understood. We have functionally identified two homologous genes C3H14 and C3H15 and found that the two genes differentially regulate secondary wall formation and anther development. C3H14 contributes more to secondary wall thickening, whereas, C3H15 is more important for anther development. We performed microarray analyses on C3H14/15 overexpressors and c3h14c3h15 double mutant to to ientify differentially-expressed genes involved in the two developmental processes. Our microarray data show that C3H14 and C3H15 regulate the expression of a number of genes involved in various biological activities, particularly those associated with secondary wall metabolism and pollen formation.

Protocol Description	The data were normalized using Robust Multi-array Average(RMA) . ID_REF =  VALUE = Normalized expression signal values.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared from 200 ng total RNA using Affymetrix 3‚Äô IVT Express kit according to the standard Affymetrix protocol	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45 degreeC on Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Total RNA was extracted from the base 4 cm part of inflorescence stems whose heights were between 12 and 17 cm of three independent wild type, C3H14/15 overexpressing lines and c3h14c3h15 double mutants.	Arabidopsis plants were grown side by side in the glasshouse with 22 degreeC and 16 h/8 h light/dark cycle.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	GeneChips were scanned using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.
