CS851269 was purchased from ABRC and confirmed as homozygous Atubc13A knock-out T-DNA mutant. We generated transgenic arabidopsis with ectopic expression of CsUBC13 gene under control of the cauliflower 35S promotor. Both genotypes and Col-0 were used to investigate the transcriptional response to Iron (Fe) deficiency. Wild type Col-0, ubc13A and transgenic overexpressor OE were grown under normal and iron-deficiency conditions. Roots were collected with 3 biological replicates."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Wenfeng Li","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Wolfgang Schmidt","role":"submitter","email":"wosh@gate.sinica.edu.tw"},{"contact":"Chungwen Lin","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["35S::CsUBC13","ubc13-\/-","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["35S::CsUBC13","ubc13-\/-","wild type"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["control","iron deprivation"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1125247,"accession":"P-GSE16964-1"},{"id":1125248,"accession":"P-GSE16964-10"},{"id":1125256,"accession":"P-GSE16964-3"},{"id":1125255,"accession":"P-GSE16964-2"},{"id":1125253,"accession":"P-GSE16964-5"},{"id":1125257,"accession":"P-GSE16964-4"},{"id":1125249,"accession":"P-GSE16964-11"},{"id":1125254,"accession":"P-GSE16964-8"},{"id":1125250,"accession":"P-GSE16964-9"},{"id":1125251,"accession":"P-GSE16964-6"},{"id":1125252,"accession":"P-GSE16964-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0}]}]}}
