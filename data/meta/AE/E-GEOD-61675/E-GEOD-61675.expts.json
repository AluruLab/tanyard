CEH1 encodes 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase (HDS), the enzyme controlling the bottleneck step of the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate via the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in the plastids. Mutation of this enzyme in ceh1 mutant led to accumulation of high levels of the stress specific signaling metabolite 2c-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cylclodiphosphate (MEcPP), and consequently constitutive activation of a selected otherwise stress responsive genes. This data identifies the ensemble of stress responsive genes whose expression is regulated by the MEcPP signaling cascade. About 20 two-week-old plants grown on 1\/2 MS medium were collected to extract total RNA. Transcriptome of parent line and ceh1 mutant were compared."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Yanmei Xiao","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Katayoon Dehesh","role":"submitter","email":"kdehesh@ucdavis.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":25922532,"authors":"Walley J, Xiao Y, Wang JZ, Baidoo EE, Keasling JD, Shen Z, Briggs SP, Dehesh K","title":"Plastid-produced interorgannellar stress signal MEcPP potentiates induction of the unfolded protein response in endoplasmic reticulum"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["2 week"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["ceh1 mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["ceh1 mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1132533,"accession":"P-GSE61675-2"},{"id":1132528,"accession":"P-GSE61675-1"},{"id":1132531,"accession":"P-GSE61675-4"},{"id":1132532,"accession":"P-GSE61675-3"},{"id":1132529,"accession":"P-GSE61675-6"},{"id":1132530,"accession":"P-GSE61675-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
