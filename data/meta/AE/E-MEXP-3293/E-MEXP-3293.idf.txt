Protocol Name	P-MTAB-21664	P-MTAB-21665	P-AFFY-2	P-AFFY-6	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown	Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat
Protocol Description	We used Plant RNeasy from Qiagen for all RNA extractions. <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Grow in growth chamber. Randomize location of trays with in the growth chamber to manage a location of growth effect. <br>(Parameters: start time = 5, stop time = 8, time unit = weeks, min temperature = 18, max temperature = 24, temperature unit = C, media = soil with vermiculite)
