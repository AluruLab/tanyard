Experiment Description	We collected pre-globular stage seed compartments from 7-micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments of seeds containing pre-globular-stage embryos was identified as those seeds containing embryo propers made up of  between 2 and 8 cells. For the purposes of this study we captured 6 compartments: embyro proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat and general seed coat. Serial sections of entire seeds were also captured for comparison. Experiment Overall Design: Pre-globular stage seed compartments or whole seeds were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 14 samples (embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, general seed coat, chalazal seed coat, whole seeds, 2 biological replicates each).

Protocol Description	Siliques between 1.0 and 1.1 cm containing pre-globular stage seeds were collected from 38-46 day old plants.  Siliques were sub-divided and fixed in 3:1 (v/v) ethanol to acetic acid and embedded in paraffin.  Microdissection of compartments was carried out on sections using a Leica LMD6000 system.	Plants were grown in a Conviron chamber under continuous light with fluorescent lamps at 20Â&deg;C and 50% - 70% relative humidity.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNaqueous Micro-Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) using a modified protocol incorporating an on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen RNase-Free DNase Set) during column washes.	2 to 5 ng of total RNA was amplified using the WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA). cDNAs were fragmented and labeled with NuGEN FL-Ovationâ¢ cDNA Biotin Module V2.
