For the purposes of this study we captured 6 compartments: embyro proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat and general seed coat. Serial sections of entire seeds were also captured for comparison. Experiment Overall Design: Pre-globular stage seed compartments or whole seeds were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 14 samples (embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripheral endosperm, chalazal endosperm, general seed coat, chalazal seed coat, whole seeds, 2 biological replicates each)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Ryan Christopher Kirkbride","role":"submitter","email":"rkirkbride@ucdavis.edu"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20702726,"authors":"Zuber H, Davidian JC, Aubert G, Aim√© D, Belghazi M, Lugan R, Heintz D, Wirtz M, Hell R, Thompson R, Gallardo K.","title":"The seed composition of Arabidopsis mutants for the group 3 sulfate transporters indicates a role in sulfate translocation within developing seeds.","doi":"10.1104\/pp.110.162123","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["per-globular stage"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["cellularized endosperm","chalazal endosperm","chalazal seed coat","embryo proper","general seed coat","micropylar endosperm","whole seed"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"ORGANISM PART","value":["cellularized endosperm","chalazal endosperm","chalazal seed coat","embryo proper","general seed coat","micropylar endosperm","whole seed"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":14,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":452770,"accession":"P-G12402-3"},{"id":452772,"accession":"P-G12402-4"},{"id":452771,"accession":"P-G12402-1"},{"id":452773,"accession":"P-G12402-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":14,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":14,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":14,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":14,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
