Here we report that an Arabidopsis mutant defective in At3g03940 and At5g18190, encoding closely related Ser\/Thr protein kinases, shows pleiotropic phenotypes including dwarfism and hypersensitivity to osmotic\/salt stress. The double mutant has reduced global levels of phosphorylated histone H3 threonine 3 (H3T3ph), which are not enhanced, unlike the response in the wild type, by drought-like treatments. Genome-wide analyses revealed increased H3T3ph, slight enhancement in trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and a modest decrease in histone H3 occupancy in pericentromeric\/knob regions of wild type plants under osmotic stress. However, despite these changes in heterochromatin, transposons and repeats remained largely transcriptionally repressed. In contrast, this reorganization of heterochromatin was mostly absent in the double mutant, which even under normal conditions exhibited lower H3T3ph levels in pericentromeric regions, and a few transposons and repeat sequences showed modest transcriptional activation. Interestingly, within actively transcribed protein-coding genes, H3T3ph density was minimal in 5â€™ genic regions, coincidental with a peak of H3K4me3 accumulation. This pattern was not affected in the double mutant, implying the existence of additional H3T3 protein kinases in Arabidopsis. Our results suggest that At3g03940 and At5g18190 are involved in the phosphorylation of H3T3 in pericentromeric\/knob regions and that this repressive epigenetic mark may be important for maintaining proper heterochromatic organization and, possibly, chromosome function(s). Columbia-0 and double mutant at3g03940\/at518190 knockdown plants were grown in 12 hr light for 3 weeks in pots in well-watered state. RNA was isolated from rosettes in triplicate for analysis on microarray."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Jianping Xu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jean-Jack M.
