Experiment Description	To reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of GH3.5 action in modulating the SA and auxin pathways, we performed transcriptional profiling of gh3.5-1D plants after infection with or without Pst DC3000(avrRpt2) on a global scale using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip Experiment Overall Design: Each 3 leaves of plants of 5-week-old wild type Columbia-0 and mutant gh3.5-1D (heterozygous) were inoculated with Pst DC3000(avrRpt2)at 105 cfu mL-1. Leaves were harvested at 0 h (uninoculated) and 48 hours after inoculation. Three biological repeats were performed on Columbia-0 (wild-type, Col-0) and gh3.5-1D (mutant) after infection with or without Pst DC3000(avrRpt2), respectively.		
Protocol Name	P-G6556-2	P-G6556-1	
Protocol Type	nucleic acid extraction protocol	nucleic acid labeling protocol	
Protocol Description	Total RNA was extracted from the leaves using the Trizol method (Invitrogen) and purified with RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized and purified with one-cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix) and GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix), respectively.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol with GeneChip IVT Labeling Kit and Genechip Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix)
