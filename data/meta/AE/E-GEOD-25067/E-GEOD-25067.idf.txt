Comment[Submitted Name]	Gene expression in response to genetic and chemical perturbations of chromatin structure							
Experiment Description	"Microarray expression profiling was used to identify genes expressed misexpressed in wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings treated with 5-aza-2â€™ deoxyctidine (5AC) or trichostatin A (TSA), and in decrease in dna methylation1 (ddm1) mutant seedlings. 10 day-old Arabidopsis seedlings (ecotype Ws) were grown in 0.5X MS media (containing 1% sucrose) at 21 C in continuous white light.  Media (including 5AC and TSA) were refreshed after 5 days of growth.  RNA was extracted using the Qiagen Plant RNeasy kit. Three biological replicates for each treatment and genotype were used."

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = log2 GCRMA signal	According to Affymetrix protocol	Plants were germinated in liquid 0.5X MS media with 1% sucrose in 15cm petri plates in constant light at 21C.	"Data for the matrix was normalized using the threestep method from Bioconductor: GCRMA background correction, scaling normalization, and median polish for summarization, for all probes on the array."	According to Affymetrix protocol	"After 24 hours, 5-AC (20mg/L)  and TSA (2.5mg/L) in DMSO were added to chemically-treated samples, control and ddm1 seedlings received DMSO alone.  After 5 days, media was drained and fresh media including supplements was added."	"10 days after germination, RNA was extracted from whole seedlings using the Qiagen Plant Rneasy kit."	According to Affymetrix protocol
