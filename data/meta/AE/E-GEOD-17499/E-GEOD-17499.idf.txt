Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from 2-week-old Arabidopsis untreated seedlings grown under a short day condition							
Experiment Description	The Arabidopsis thaliana defense regulator EDM2 was previously shown to be specifically required for disease resistance to the pathogenic oomycete Hyaloperonospora parasitica aradidopsis mediated by the R protein RPP7. We found EDM2 to have a promoting effect on several distinct developmental processes, such as leaf pavement cell development, vegetative phase change or the floral transition. We further identified the atypical protein kinase WNK8 to physically interact with EDM2 in nuclei. Microarray data support regulatory interactions between WNK8 and EDM2 as well as their functional association with the autonomous floral promotion pathway. To assess interactions between EDM2 and WNK8 at the transcriptome level, we profiled transcript patterns of Col-0, edm2-2, wnk8-1, wnk8-2, wnk8-3 and an edm2-2 complementation line pXVE:HA-EDM2-a seedlings using Affymetrix ATH1 whole genome arrays. Plant materials were grown under short day conditions for 2 weeks. Total RNA was isolated from untreated seedlings and hybridized to the GeneChip following the manufacturer's instructions. Each genotype has three independent biological replicates.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = log2 RMA signal intensity	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Drosophila Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Arabidopsis plants were grown at 22 Â°C under short day conditions (8 hr light/16 hr dark)	Data was processed in the statistical programming environment R using Bioconductor packages. Raw expression values were normalized using the robust multichip averaging algorithm.	GeneChips were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 with 7G upgrade	Untreated.	Total RNA was isolated from seedlings using TRIzol Reagenet (Invitrogen) and further purified with RNeasy Plant mini kit columns (Qiagen) according to the protocols supplied by the manufacturers.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard 1 cycle Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manua, REV3, Affymetrix).
