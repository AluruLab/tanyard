Investigation Title	Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana treated with NO donor SNP, compared to NO depletion by cPTIO									
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana treated with NO donor SNP, compared to NO depletion by cPTIO									
Experiment Description	Nitric oxide (NO) is considered a key regulator of plant developmental processes and defense. Characterization of root-related phenotypes and the involvement of NO in the regulation of primary root growth. Three-experimental condition, SDW, SNP and cPTIO. Biological replicates: 3 control replicates (SDW) , 3  replicates treated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 3 replicates treated with 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO)

Protocol Description	Analysis was performed using the affylmaGUI R package (Wettenhall et al., 2006). Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA) algorithm was used for background correction, normalization and expression levels summarization (Irizarry et al., 2003). Next, differential expression analysis was performed with the Bayes t-statistics from the linear models for Microarray data (limma), included in the affylmGUI package. P-values were corrected for multiple-testing using the Benjamini-Hochbergâs method (False Discovery Rate) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Reiner et al., 2003). ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA signal intensity	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 4 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChipÂ® Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	After 3 days seedlings were placed under different treatments in open plastic dishes (receiver dish). Three receiver dishes were introduced in a 15 cm Petri dish together with one open, 5 cm Petri dish (donor dish) that contained 15 ml of the solution to be tested, 100 uM sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Three receiver dishes were introduced in another 15 cm Petri dish and 2 ml of 1 mM 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) solution were added into the receiver dishes. The 15 cm Petri dishes were sealed. After 5 days of treatment, tissues were collected and frozen (-80 ÂºC).	The Arabidopsis plants used throughout this work were routinely grown in a growth chamber under 50-60% humidity, a temperature of 22Â°C, and with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod at 80 to 100 ÂµE m-2 s-1 in pots containing a 1:3 vermiculite:soil mixture.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	GeneChips were scanned using GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G System
