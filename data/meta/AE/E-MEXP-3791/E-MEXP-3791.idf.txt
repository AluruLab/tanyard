Experiment Description	Wild-type (Col-0) and mutant plants (adg1-1, tpt-2, adg1-1/tpt-2) were grown for 28 days under low light conditions and were then transferred to HL. Leaf samples for transcriptional profiling were taken at time 0 (before transfer to high light) and 4 hours and 48 hours (2 days) after transfer to high light.

Protocol Description	Total RNA was extracted modified after Logemann et al., 1987. Frozen leaf material (100 mg) was pulverized in liquid nitrogen and further homogenized in 600 µl Z6-buffer (8 M guanidinium-HCl, 20 mM MES, 20 mM EDTA [pH 7.0] and 0.7% [v/v] 2-mercaptoethanol). Following the addition of 500 µl PCI solution (phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol; 25:24:1) the extract was shaken thoroughly and subjected to centrifugation (20000 x g, 10 min, 4 oC) for phase separation. The aqueous phase  was mixed with 0.05 volumes of 1N acetic acid and 0.7 volumes 100% ethanol. The RNA was precipitated at 4 oC for 1 hour.  Following centrifugation (20000 x g, 10 min, 4 oC) the sedimented RNA was washed subsequently with 500 µl Na-acetate (pH 5.2) and 80 % ethanol. The RNA pellet was was first dried, then dissolved in 20 µl ultrapure water and stored at -80 oC until use. For quality control total RNA was re-purified using the Rneasy Mini Kit (Quiagen).<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = genomic DNA, Amplification = none)	Scanning was performed at KFB Regensburg (http://www.kfb-regensburg.de)<br>(Parameters: Scanning hardware = 418 [Affymetrix], Scanning software = AIDA [Raytest GmbH])	Labeling was performed at KFB Regensburg (http://www.kfb-regensburg.de) using the GeneChip 3’ IVT Express Kit and Affymetrix standard protocols.<br><br>URL: http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual.affx<br><br>3_ivt_express_kit_manual.pdf<br><br><br>(Parameters: Amount of nucleic acid labeled = 50, Mass unit = Nano gram, Amplification = PCR)	Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type (Col-0) and mutant plants (tpt-2, adg1-1, adg1-1/tpt-2) were grown on soil under low light conditions (photon flux density [PFD] = 30 µmol x m-2 x s-1, 16 hours light/8 hours dark) for four weeks in a Percival growth chamber and were then transferred to high light conditions (PFD = 300 µmol x m-2 x s-1, 16 hours light/8 h dark) according to Schmitz et al. (2012). The temperature was kept constant at 22 oC (day) and 18 oC (night).<br><br><br><br>Schmitz, J., Schottler, M.A., Krueger, S., Geimer, S., Schneider, A., Kleine, T., Leister, D., Bell, K., Flugge, U.I., and Hausler, R.E.

BMC Plant Biol. 12: 8.<br><br><br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)	For each sample 5 rosettes without cotyledons were pooled.	Leaf material of low light grown 4 week old plants (Col-0, tpt-2, adg1-1, adg1-1/tpt-2) was harvested 3.5 hours in the light, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC until use. The plants were then exposed to light light and further leaf samples were harvested 4 hours and 48 hours after transfer from low light to high light. 	The quality control of RNA, preparation of biotinylated amplified RNA and hybridization was performed at KFB Regensburg (http://www.kfb-regensburg.de) using the GeneChip 3’ IVT Express Kit and Affymetrix standard protocols.<br><br><br><br><br>(Parameters: Chamber type = Affymetrix- GeneChip Hyb Oven 640, Quantity of label target used = 1, Mass unit = Micro gram, Tiny time unit = seconds, Volume unit = Nano litre, temperature = 65)
