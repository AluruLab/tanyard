Frozen leaf material (100 mg) was pulverized in liquid nitrogen and further homogenized in 600 µl Z6-buffer (8 M guanidinium-HCl, 20 mM MES, 20 mM EDTA [pH 7.0] and 0.7% [v\/v] 2-mercaptoethanol). Following the addition of 500 µl PCI solution (phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol; 25:24:1) the extract was shaken thoroughly and subjected to centrifugation (20000 x g, 10 min, 4 oC) for phase separation. The aqueous phase  was mixed with 0.05 volumes of 1N acetic acid and 0.7 volumes 100% ethanol. The RNA was precipitated at 4 oC for 1 hour.  Following centrifugation (20000 x g, 10 min, 4 oC) the sedimented RNA was washed subsequently with 500 µl Na-acetate (pH 5.2) and 80 % ethanol. The RNA pellet was was first dried, then dissolved in 20 µl ultrapure water and stored at -80 oC until use. For quality control total RNA was re-purified using the Rneasy Mini Kit (Quiagen).",{"br":null},"(Parameters: Extracted product = genomic DNA, Amplification = none)"],"type":"nucleic_acid_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":674756,"accession":"P-MTAB-30244","name":"P-MTAB-30244","text":["Scanning was performed at KFB Regensburg (",{"a":{"href":"http:\/\/www.kfb-regensburg.de","target":"_blank","$":"http:\/\/www.kfb-regensburg.de"}},")",{"br":null},"(Parameters: Scanning hardware = 418 [Affymetrix], Scanning software = AIDA [Raytest GmbH])"],"type":"image_acquisition","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":674758,"accession":"P-MTAB-30245","name":"P-MTAB-30245","text":["Labeling was performed at KFB Regensburg (",{"a":{"href":"http:\/\/www.kfb-regensburg.de","target":"_blank","$":"http:\/\/www.kfb-regensburg.de"}},") using the GeneChip 3’ IVT Express Kit and Affymetrix standard protocols.",{"br":null},{"br":null},"URL: ",{"a":{"href":"http:\/\/www.affymetrix.com\/support\/technical\/manual.affx","target":"_blank","$":"http:\/\/www.affymetrix.com\/support\/technical\/manual.affx"}},{"br":null},{"br":null},"3_ivt_express_kit_manual.pdf",{"br":null},{"br":null},{"br":null},"(Parameters: Amount of nucleic acid labeled = 50, Mass unit = Nano gram, Amplification = PCR)"],"type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":674759,"accession":"P-MTAB-30246","name":"P-MTAB-30246","text":["Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type (Col-0) and mutant plants (tpt-2, adg1-1, adg1-1\/tpt-2) were grown on soil under low light conditions (photon flux density [PFD] = 30 µmol x m-2 x s-1, 16 hours light\/8 hours dark) for four weeks in a Percival growth chamber and were then transferred to high light conditions (PFD = 300 µmol x m-2 x s-1, 16 hours light\/8 h dark) according to Schmitz et al.
