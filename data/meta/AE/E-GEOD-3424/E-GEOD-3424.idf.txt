Experiment Description	How do transcript levels of leaf-expressed genes change in a normal day-night cycle of the phosphoglucomutase (pgm) mutant? The interest is in genes that are regulated by the circadian clock and the diurnal component (i.e. light, metabolite changes). Plants were grown on soil in a 12/12 h light/dark rhythm at 20Â°C day and night. 5 weeks after germination the rosettes of the non-flowering plants were harvested, 15 plants per sample. Plants were harvested in series at 6 times every 4 hours, beginning with the end of the night (still in darkness). Experiment Overall Design: A diurnal time series (8 times) was analyzed.

Protocol Description	5 x 3 rosettes were harvested and directly frozen by liquid nitrogen, inside the growth chamber. The material of 15 rosettes was ground in liquid nitrogen.Total RNA was extracted from 250 mg fresh weight using 5 ml TriZol. Organic compounts were removed by 2 chloroform extractions. Precipitation was done with sodium chloride/sodium citrate/2-propanol over night at 4Â&deg;C. Ethanol wash of RNA pellet was done twice with 75% Ethanol. Total RNA was dissolved in pure H2O.	Approximately 10 Â&#956;g of total RNA was processed to produce biotinylated cRNA targets.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description:
