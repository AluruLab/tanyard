The interest is in genes that are regulated by the circadian clock and the diurnal component (i.e. light, metabolite changes). Plants were grown on soil in a 12\/12 h light\/dark rhythm at 20°C day and night. 5 weeks after germination the rosettes of the non-flowering plants were harvested, 15 plants per sample. Plants were harvested in series at 6 times every 4 hours, beginning with the end of the night (still in darkness). Experiment Overall Design: A diurnal time series (8 times) was analyzed."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Oliver E.
