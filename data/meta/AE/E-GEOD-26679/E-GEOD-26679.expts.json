To better characterize and understand the defense response of edr1, a time course of early signaling responses was performed after inoculation with powdery mildew and compared to the responses of wild-type Col-0.  These time points represent early stages in the infection process, before any signs of susceptibility or resistance are visible. Four-week-old Col-0 and edr1 plants were inoculated with powdery mildew and whole rosettes were collected at 0, 18, 36, and 96 hours post inoculation.  Each sample is a pool of four rosettes processed together."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Roger Innes","role":"submitter","email":"rinnes@indiana.edu"},{"contact":"Katy MChristiansen","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Roger W Innes","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21726375,"authors":"Christiansen KM, Gu Y, Rodibaugh N, Innes RW.","title":"Negative regulation of defence signalling pathways by the EDR1 protein kinase","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"genotype","value":["Col-0","edr1 mutant"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["rosette"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["edr1 mutant","wild type"]},{"name":"infect","value":["Golovinomyces cichoracearum","none"]},{"name":"time","value":["0 hour","18 hour","36 hour","96 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":32,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1127688,"accession":"P-GSE26679-2"},{"id":1127686,"accession":"P-GSE26679-3"},{"id":1127681,"accession":"P-GSE26679-1"},{"id":1127685,"accession":"P-GSE26679-5"},{"id":1127687,"accession":"P-GSE26679-4"},{"id":1127682,"accession":"P-GSE26679-7"},{"id":1127684,"accession":"P-GSE26679-6"},{"id":1127683,"accession":"P-GSE26679-8"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":32,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":32,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":32,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":32,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":32,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":32,"isderived":0}]}]}}
