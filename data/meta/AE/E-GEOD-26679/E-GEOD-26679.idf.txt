To better characterize and understand the defense response of edr1, a time course of early signaling responses was performed after inoculation with powdery mildew and compared to the responses of wild-type Col-0.  These time points represent early stages in the infection process, before any signs of susceptibility or resistance are visible. Four-week-old Col-0 and edr1 plants were inoculated with powdery mildew and whole rosettes were collected at 0, 18, 36, and 96 hours post inoculation.  Each sample is a pool of four rosettes processed together."							Date of Experiment								Term Source Name	EFO							Term Source Version								Term Source File	http://bar.ebi.ac.uk:8080/trac/browser/branches/curator/ExperimentalFactorOntology/ExFactorInOWL/currentrelease/eforelease/efo.owl							Person Last Name	Innes	Innes	MChristiansen					Person First Name	Roger	Roger	Katy					Person Mid Initials		W						Person Email	rinnes@indiana.edu							Person Affiliation	Indiana University							Person Phone	812-855-2219							Person Fax								Person Address	"Biology, Indiana University, 915 East Third Street, Bloomington, IN, USA"							Person Roles	submitter							Person Roles Term Source REF								Person Roles Term Accession Number								Normalization Type								Normalization Term Accession Number								Normalization Term Source REF								Replicate Type								Replicate Term Accession Number								Replicate Term Source REF								Experimental Design								Experimental Design Term Accession Number								Experimental Design Term Source REF								Quality Control Type								Quality Control Term Accession Number								Quality Control Term Source REF								Protocol Name	P-GSE26679-1	P-GSE26679-6	P-GSE26679-3	P-GSE26679-8	P-GSE26679-7	P-GSE26679-2	P-GSE26679-4	P-GSE26679-5Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = log2	"Fifteen µg of biotinylated cRNA is added to a total hybridization cocktail of 300 µl, and 200 µl is hybridized to a GeneChip® after adding control oligonucleotides. Hybridization is at 45°C for 17 h with constant rotation. The hybridization mixture is then removed and the GeneChips® are washed, stained with phycoerythrin-labeled Streptavidin, washed, incubated with biotinylated anti-streptavidin, and then restained with phycoerythrin-labeled Streptavidin to amplify the signals; these steps are carried out using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station."	Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and edr1 seeds were sown on Metromix soil and placed at 4ºC for three days.  Plants were then transferred to a growth room and grown under 9 hour days at a temperature of 23ºC for four weeks.	"MAS5.0, GCRMA"	"Arrays were scanned using the dedicated scanner, controlled by Affymetrix GCOS software.  The data was analyzed with Affymetrix MAS5 and the average intensity on each array is normalized by global scaling to a target intensity of 1000."	"Plants were inoculated with Golovinomyces cichoracearum using a settling tower ~1 meter tall.  Plants to be inoculated were placed at the bottom of the tower, which contained a Nytex mesh screen at the top.  Four pad4 mutants with heavy powder growth were passed over the mesh 20 times each to transfer the spores to the plants below.  Spores were allowed to settle for 30 minutes and the plants were transferred to growth chambers."	"Tissue was collected for each time point (0, 18, 36, and 96 hours) by harvesting four full rosettes per genotype per biological replicate.  Four biological replicates were collected and placed in liquid nitrogen.  Tissue was ground with a mortar and pestle and used for RNA preparations.  High quality RNA was prepared using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma) and concentrated to >0.75 μg/μl with the RNEasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen). A total of 6 µg RNA was used."	Biotinlylated cRNA was made using the Affymetrix IVT kit.Protocol Software								Protocol Hardware								Protocol Contact								Protocol Type	bioassay_data_transformation	hybridization	grow	feature_extraction	image_aquisition	specified_biomaterial_action	nucleic_acid_extraction	labelingProtocol Term Source REF								Protocol Term Accession Number								Experimental Factor Name	genotype	infect	time					Experimental Factor Type	genotype	infect	time					Experimental Factor Term Source REF								Experimental Factor Term Accession Number								Publication Title	Negative regulation of defence signalling pathways by the EDR1 protein kinase							Publication Author List	"Christiansen KM, Gu Y, Rodibaugh N, Innes RW."							PubMed ID	21726375							Publication DOI	10.1111/j.1364-3703.2011.00708.x							Publication Status	published							Publication Status Term Source REF	EFO							Publication Status Term Accession Number	EFO_0001796							Comment[SecondaryAccession]	GSE26679							Comment[GEOLastUpdateDate]	2011-01-19							Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis mutant for edr1 after infection with Golovinomyces cichoracearum							Comment[AEExperimentType]	transcription profiling by array							Comment[GEOReleaseDate]	2011-01-19							Comment[ArrayExpressSubmissionDate]	2011-01-18							SDRF File	E-GEOD-26679.sdrf.txt
