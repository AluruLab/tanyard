The first committed enzyme in biotin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthase is encoded by At5g04620 (BIO4). We isolated a novel T-DNA insertion mutant of BIO4 (bio4-1) showing a spontaneous cell death phenotype that could be rescued both by exogenous biotin and genetic complementation. The bio4-1 plants exhibited massive accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. The T-DNA insertion in the bio4-1 mutant contains a Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase B9 (AT4G21850) under a constitutive 35S CaMV promoter. To dissect the specific effects of biotin defiency on gene expression on a genome wide scale, we compared expression of wt Col-0 leaves with bio4-1 mutants and bio4-1 mutants complemented with D-biotin. Expression in leaves of Col-0 wt, bio4-1 mutants with a T-DNA insertion in the 5`-UTR of BIO4, and bio4-1 mutants complemented with watering with 200µM D-biotin."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Günter Brader","role":"submitter","email":"guenter.brader@ait.ac.at"},{"contact":"Elina Helenius","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Tarja Kariola","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Günter Brader","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"E-Tapio Palva","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jing Li","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":22126457,"authors":"Li J, Brader G, Helenius E, Kariola T, Palva ET","title":"Biotin deficiency causes spontaneous cell death and activation of defense signaling.","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-313X.2011.04871.x"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["5 week old plants"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaves"]},{"category":"variation","value":["bio4-1 mutant","wild type"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"VARIATION","value":["bio4-1 mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":571896,"accession":"P-GSE26631-8"},{"id":571893,"accession":"P-GSE26631-1"},{"id":571897,"accession":"P-GSE26631-2"},{"id":571899,"accession":"P-GSE26631-3"},{"id":571898,"accession":"P-GSE26631-4"},{"id":571894,"accession":"P-GSE26631-5"},{"id":571900,"accession":"P-GSE26631-6"},{"id":571895,"accession":"P-GSE26631-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
