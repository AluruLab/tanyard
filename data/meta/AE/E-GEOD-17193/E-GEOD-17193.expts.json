The results showed that jasmonate and defense responsive genes, camalexin and lignin biosynthetic genes were among genes up-regulated by chitosan. Several transcription factors are also strongly induced by chitosan. The results suggested that chitosan can be used as a strong elicitor of defense pathways. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia (Col-0) seeds were sterilized for 7 min in 1.7% (v\/v) bleach solution, incubated over night in 4% PPM (Plant Preservative Mixture, Plant Cell Technology, Washington DC, USA) in a full strength sterilized Murashige-Skoog (MS) salt solution with gentle shaking. Subsequently, the seeds were rinsed in abundant sterile water and transferred into 2.5 ml liquid growing media (MS half strength solution) with 0.05% PPM in 6-well plates. The plates were incubated in the dark at 4 °C for two days and finally transferred to continuous light (90µm photons\/ m-2) with gentle swirling for four days in a plant growth chamber at 22 °C.  Experiment Overall Design:  . Treatments were performed by comparing  a control solution containing the solvent used to solubilize chitosan, and a chitosan solution concentrated 150 µg\/ml."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Pierdomenico Perata","role":"submitter","email":"p.perata@sssup.it"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21240536,"authors":"Povero G, Loreti E, Pucciariello C, Santaniello A, Di Tommaso D, Di Tommaso G, Kapetis D, Zolezzi F, Piaggesi A, Perata P.","title":"Transcript profiling of chitosan-treated Arabidopsis seedlings","doi":"10.1007\/s10265-010-0399-1","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["4 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"COMPOUND","value":["chitosan","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":448793,"accession":"P-G17193-6"},{"id":448789,"accession":"P-G17193-5"},{"id":448791,"accession":"P-G17193-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":448792,"accession":"P-G17193-1"},{"id":448790,"accession":"P-G17193-4"},{"id":448788,"accession":"P-G17193-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
