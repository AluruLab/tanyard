Experiment Description	We treated Arabidopsis seedlings with chitosan and carried out a transcript profiling analysis (GeneChip microarrays) in order to identify genes and transcription factors regulated by chitosan. The results showed that jasmonate and defense responsive genes, camalexin and lignin biosynthetic genes were among genes up-regulated by chitosan. Several transcription factors are also strongly induced by chitosan. The results suggested that chitosan can be used as a strong elicitor of defense pathways. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia (Col-0) seeds were sterilized for 7 min in 1.7% (v/v) bleach solution, incubated over night in 4% PPM (Plant Preservative Mixture, Plant Cell Technology, Washington DC, USA) in a full strength sterilized Murashige-Skoog (MS) salt solution with gentle shaking. Subsequently, the seeds were rinsed in abundant sterile water and transferred into 2.5 ml liquid growing media (MS half strength solution) with 0.05% PPM in 6-well plates. The plates were incubated in the dark at 4 Â°C for two days and finally transferred to continuous light (90Âµm photons/ m-2) with gentle swirling for four days in a plant growth chamber at 22 Â°C.  Experiment Overall Design:  . Treatments were performed by comparing  a control solution containing the solvent used to solubilize chitosan, and a chitosan solution concentrated 150 Âµg/ml.

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis seedlings. Ecotype: Columbia 0; Age: 4 days; Germination: aerobic; Medium: Murashige-Skoog medium, half-strenght, sucrose 30 mM, 23Â°C, continuous light; Treated for 3h with chitosan under continuous light.	Arabidopsis seedlings. Ecotype: Columbia 0; Age: 4 days; Germination: aerobic; Medium: Murashige-Skoog medium, half-strenght, sucrose 30 mM, 23Â°C, continuous light; Treated for 3 hours with chitosan under continuous light.	Seeds were sterilized with diluted bleach (10-min incubation in 1.7% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed and washed seven times in sterile water) and incubated in 2.5 mL of liquid growing media (Murashige and Skoog half-strength solution in six-well plates) containing 30 mM sucrose. The plates were incubated in the dark at 4Â°C for two days (vernalization, to promote homogeneous germination) and then transferred to 23Â°C for four days under continuous light before the treatments.	Total RNA was extracted from the seedling samples using the Ambion RNAqueous kit (Ambion). RNA quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. RNA was processed for use on Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip arrays.	Affymetrix standard labeling protocol	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	GC-RMA algorithm
