Then for the split-root experiments, the root system was washed in water to discard the sand and separated in two parts dipped in 2 containers (300 mL each) containing either the same medium (MS/10 supplied with 500 ?M Pi (cP500) or without Pi (cP0) or different media (500 ?M Pi and no Pi, respectively spP500 and spP0) for two days. Three plants were pooled for each condition and the experiment was triplicated."							Protocol Name	P-MTAB-12703	P-MTAB-12701	P-MTAB-12702	P-AFFY-2	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4[]	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown	P-AFFY-6	Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStatProtocol Type	grow	specified_biomaterial_action	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformationProtocol Description	"Arabidopsis plants were grown for 6 to 7 weeks in sand and supplied with full nutrient.

"Total RNA from roots were extracted in phenol-chloroform (room temperature), precipitated in LiCl and purified with Dnase (DNAfree, Ambion). RNAs quality was checked by Agilent Lab-on-chip analysis.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
