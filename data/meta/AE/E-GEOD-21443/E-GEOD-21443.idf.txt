Experiment Description	Transcriptional profile of whole roots of wild-type and pye-1 mutants exposed to 24 hours -Fe were generated Global population increases and climate change underscore the need for better comprehension of how plants acquire and process nutrients such as iron. A systems biology approach was taken to elucidate novel regulatory mechanisms involved in plant responses to iron deficiency (-Fe). Using cell-type specific transcriptional profiling we identified a pericycle-specific iron deficiency response, and a previously uncharacterized transcription factor, POPEYE (PYE), that plays an important role in this response. Functional analysis of PYE suggests that it positively regulates growth and development under iron deficient conditions. ChIP-on-chip analysis and transcriptional profiling reveal that PYE helps maintain iron homeostasis by directly and indirectly regulating the expression of ferric reductases, metal ion transporters, iron storage proteins, and other key iron homeostasis genes. In addition to PYE, we also identified a second protein BRUTUS (BTS), which appears to negatively regulate the response to iron deficiency. BTS is a unique putative E3 ligase protein, with metal ion binding and DNA binding domains. PYE and BTS are tightly co-regulated and physically interact with PYE paralogs, one of which is thought to positively regulate expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis. We propose that iron content is sensed within the pericycle where PYE, perhaps in conjunction with BTS and other regulatory proteins, is then activated to control a regulatory network involved in maintaining proper iron distribution in plants.  Keywords: Expression analysis To determine how loss of PYE expression affects the transcriptional profile of whole roots, pye-1 mutants and wild-type seeds were germinated under standard growth conditions then transferred to standard media (control, MS media) or iron deficient media (-Fe, 0.3mM Ferrozine in MS media containing no ferrous sulfate). After 24 hours of exposure to +Fe or -Fe whole roots were collected and analyzed.

Protocol Description	Seeds were surface sterilized for 2 minutes in 70% ethanol, the ethanol was removed, then replaced with 30% Bleach and 0.02% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes. Seeds were rinsed 3 times with sterile water, stratified for 4ËC for 2 days, then placed on standard media. Standard media is 1X Murashige and Skoog salt mixture in which ferrous sulfate is replaced with 100mM Fe(III)-EDTA, 0.5g/L MES, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH.  âFe media is 1X Murashige and Skoog salt mixture in which ferrous sulfate is replaced with 0.3mM Ferrozine. Nylon mesh was placed on top of the solidified media and seeds were planted at ~20 seeds/cm in two rows.	Samples were prepared as in Birnbaum et al. (2005) Nat. Methods for roots grown under standard conditions. Roots were transferred to +Fe or -Fe media for 24 hours. Roots were then cut with a razor blade 0.5 mm below the root/hypocotyl junction and collected into RNA extraction buffer.  Approximately 320 roots were collected per replicate, with two biological replicates being performed per line.	RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH).	Fragmented cRNA probes were prepared using the one-cycle amplification protocol by Affymetrix.	Samples were submitted to Expression Analysis Inc. (Durham, NC) for hybridization to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.	Samples were submitted to Expression Analysis Inc. (Durham, NC) for hybridization to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.
