A systems biology approach was taken to elucidate novel regulatory mechanisms involved in plant responses to iron deficiency (-Fe). Using cell-type specific transcriptional profiling we identified a pericycle-specific iron deficiency response, and a previously uncharacterized transcription factor, POPEYE (PYE), that plays an important role in this response. Functional analysis of PYE suggests that it positively regulates growth and development under iron deficient conditions. ChIP-on-chip analysis and transcriptional profiling reveal that PYE helps maintain iron homeostasis by directly and indirectly regulating the expression of ferric reductases, metal ion transporters, iron storage proteins, and other key iron homeostasis genes. In addition to PYE, we also identified a second protein BRUTUS (BTS), which appears to negatively regulate the response to iron deficiency. BTS is a unique putative E3 ligase protein, with metal ion binding and DNA binding domains. PYE and BTS are tightly co-regulated and physically interact with PYE paralogs, one of which is thought to positively regulate expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis. We propose that iron content is sensed within the pericycle where PYE, perhaps in conjunction with BTS and other regulatory proteins, is then activated to control a regulatory network involved in maintaining proper iron distribution in plants.  Keywords: Expression analysis To determine how loss of PYE expression affects the transcriptional profile of whole roots, pye-1 mutants and wild-type seeds were germinated under standard growth conditions then transferred to standard media (control, MS media) or iron deficient media (-Fe, 0.3mM Ferrozine in MS media containing no ferrous sulfate). After 24 hours of exposure to +Fe or -Fe whole roots were collected and analyzed."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Terri A Long","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Terri Anita Long","role":"submitter","email":"tlong@duke.edu"},{"contact":"Philip N Benfey","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20675571,"authors":"Long TA, Tsukagoshi H, Busch W, Lahner B, Salt DE, Benfey PN","title":"The bHLH transcription factor POPEYE regulates response to iron deficiency in Arabidopsis roots.","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.110.074096","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["7 days"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["pye-1","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["pye-1","wild_type"]},{"name":"GROWTH CONDITION","value":["iron deprivation","standard media"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":8,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":446421,"accession":"P-GSE21443-2"},{"id":446420,"accession":"P-GSE21443-3"},{"id":446415,"accession":"P-GSE21443-1"},{"id":446417,"accession":"P-GSE21443-8"},{"id":446416,"accession":"P-GSE21443-5"},{"id":446422,"accession":"P-GSE21443-4"},{"id":446419,"accession":"P-GSE21443-7"},{"id":446418,"accession":"P-GSE21443-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":8,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":8,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":8,"isderived":0}]}]}}
