(2005) Nat. Methods for roots grown under standard conditions. Roots were transferred to +Fe or -Fe media for 24 hours. Roots were then cut with a razor blade 0.5 mm below the root\/hypocotyl junction and collected into RNA extraction buffer.  Approximately 320 roots were collected per replicate, with two biological replicates being performed per line.","type":"specified_biomaterial_action","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":446420,"accession":"P-GSE21443-3","name":"P-GSE21443-3","text":"Seeds were surface sterilized for 2 minutes in 70% ethanol, the ethanol was removed, then replaced with 30% Bleach and 0.02% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes.
