With the aid of the GetCID service, we believe iae1 has been localised to a relatively small region (~100kb); while mapping has restricted iae2 to a small interval (~50kb) with a very limited number of candidate genes. Although it has proved difficult to determine which gene is mutated in iae1, we belive that use of the transcriptomics service will help identify which genes are affected (directly and indirectly) in this background.  The iae2 locus is sufficiently restricted by genetics and by molecular data that identifying a candidate (and any downstream loci affected) should be straightforward. We require the use of the full genome chips. The data from this experiment should help tie together the data we have for a paper that is currently in preparation.
