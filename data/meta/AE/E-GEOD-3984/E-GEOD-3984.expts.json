Leaves were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Three biological replicates were obtained over a period of 6 months. For each replicate, RNA was extracted using standard phenol\/chloroform protocol and biotin-labeled cRNA was synthesized. cRNA was hybridized to 6 ATH1 GeneChip arrays. Cel files produced by the Affymetrix software were imported into R. Background subtraction, normalization and probe summaries were performed with the rma, quantile.normalization and median polish options of the rma function. Comparison of the SA- versus mock-treated tissue provides insight on the genes involved in systemic acquired resistance in Arabidopsis. Experiment Overall Design: 3 mock-treated and 3 SA-treated biological replicates were analyzed (one array each)"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Francoise Thibaud-Nissen","role":"submitter","email":"fthibaud@tigr.org"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":16824183,"authors":"Francoise Thibaud-Nissen, Hank Wu, Todd Richmond, Julia C Redman, Christopher Johnson, Roland Green, Jonathan Arias, Christopher D Town","title":"Development of Arabidopsis whole-genome microarrays and their application to the discovery of binding sites for the TGA2 transcription factor in salicylic acid-treated plants.","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-313X.2006.02770.x","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"BioSourceType","value":["frozen_sample"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["none","salicylic acid"]},{"name":"dose","value":["1 millimolar","Unspecified"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":501029,"accession":"P-G3984-4"},{"id":501031,"accession":"P-G3984-1"},{"id":501028,"accession":"P-G3984-2"},{"id":501030,"accession":"P-G3984-3"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
