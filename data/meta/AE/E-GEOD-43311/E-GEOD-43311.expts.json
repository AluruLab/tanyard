Phytochrome-Interacting bHLH transcription Factors (PIFs), which are repressors of photomorphogenesis accumulate in darkness and are degraded in the light in a phytochrome-dependent manner. Two PIFs, PIF1 and PIF3 accumulated in the light in hmr mutants. In order to determine the gene expression of PIF-dependent genes in hmr mutants in the light, we have performed whole-genome expression analysis on two hmr mutants: a null allele, hmr-5; and a weak allele, hmr-22. Wild-type (Col-0) and hmr mutant seeds were surface-sterilized and plated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) growth medium without sucrose. The seeds were stratified in the dark at 4ºC for 4d. Seedlings were grown in constant red light (Rc, 10μmol\/m2\/s) at 21°C for 4d."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Meng Chen","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Meina Li","role":"submitter","email":"meng.chen@duke.edu"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["hmr-22 weak allele mutant","hmr-5 null mutant","wild type genotype"]},{"category":"growth condition","value":["grown in constant red light (Rc, 10μmol\/m2\/s) at 21°C for 4 days"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["hmr-22 weak allele mutant","hmr-5 null mutant","wild type genotype"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1126475,"accession":"P-GSE43311-6"},{"id":1126476,"accession":"P-GSE43311-5"},{"id":1126477,"accession":"P-GSE43311-4"},{"id":1126479,"accession":"P-GSE43311-3"},{"id":1126478,"accession":"P-GSE43311-2"},{"id":1126474,"accession":"P-GSE43311-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
