Experiment Description	Most higher organisms, including plants and animals, have developed a time-keeping mechanism that allows them to anticipate daily fluctuations of environmental parameters such as light and temperature.  This circadian clock efficiently coordinates plant growth and metabolism with respect to time-of-day by producing self-sustained rhythms of gene expression with an approximately 24-hour period.  The importance of these rhythms has in fact been demonstrated in both phytoplankton and higher plants: organisms that have an internal clock period matched to the external environment possess a competitive advantage over those that do not. We used microarrays to identify circadian-regulated genes of Arabidopsis thaliana to elucidate how the clock provides an adaptive advantage by  understanding how the clock regulates outputs and determining which pathways and processes may be under circadian control. Experiment Overall Design: Groups of Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in light/dark cycles for 7 d before, transferred to constant light, and after 24 h in constant light 12 samples were harvested at 4-h intervals over the next 44 h for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Protocol Description	Seeds sown on  filter paper on media (1x MS, 3% sucrose, 0.8% agar); stratified at 4C for 4 d; grown for 7 d at 22C in 12-h  light (cool white fluorescence tubes, ~120 Â&#956;mol m-2 s-1)/12-h dark cycles before being released into free-running conditions of constant white light, 22C; sample collection initiated at subjective dawn of day 9	Samples were collected at 4-h intervals (by freezing in liquid nitrogen) while growing in constant light conditions	Qiagen's RNeasy Plant Mini Kit was used for extraction of total RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 Â&#956;g total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).		Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
