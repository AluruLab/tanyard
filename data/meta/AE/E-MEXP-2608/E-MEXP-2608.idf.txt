Experiment Description	Here we compare transcriptomic data generated using Affymetrix one-cycle (standard labelling protocol), two-cycle (small-sample protocol) and IVT-Express protocols with the Affymetrix ATH1 array using Arabidopsis root samples. Results obtained with each protocol are broadly similar. However, we show that there are 35 probe sets (of a total of 22810) that are misrepresented in the two-cycle data sets. Of these, 33 probe sets were classed as mis-amplified when comparisons of two independent publicly available data sets were undertaken.

Protocol Description	Data were normalised from .cel files using the RMA protocol within R / Bioconductor with default settings using Bioconductors standard Affymetrix metadata and probe mapping files	Approximately 600 roots were dissected for the rapid elongation zone (EZ) (from the top of the lateral root cap to the first visible root hair bulge, approximately 850 µm from the top of the lateral root cap). Dissected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen	RNA labelling and hybridisation to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays were performed by the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC), according to manufacturers recommended protocol for the IVT-express kit<br>(Parameters: Amplification = none, Mass unit = Micro gram)	Wild-type Col-0 seedlings were grown vertically on ½ MS media supplemented with 1 % (w/v) PGP-type agarose (Park Scientific Ltd., UK) for seven days in controlled environmental conditions of 24 °C, continuous light of 150 µmol m-1 s-1. Plants for seed propagation were grown simultaneous in controlled conditions with a 16h light (23 °C), 8h dark (18 °C) cycle.<br>(Parameters: start time = 7, time unit = days, min temperature = 24, temperature unit = C, media = ½ MS media supplemented with 1 % (w/v) PGP-type agarose)	RNA labelling and hybridisation to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays were performed by the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC), according to manufacturers recommended protocol for the 1-cycle amplification kit<br>(Parameters: Amplification = none, Mass unit = Micro gram)	RNA labelling and hybridisation to Affymetrix ATH1 arrays were performed by the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC), according to manufacturers recommended protocol for the 2-cycle amplification kit<br>(Parameters: Amplification = none, Mass unit = Micro gram)	Approximately 600 roots were dissected into the meristem (MS) (from the root tip to the top of the lateral root cap, approximately 350 µm from the root tip). Dissected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen	RNA was extracted using the Qiagen MicroRNA Kit following the manufacturers recommended protocol (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop ND100 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilimington, USA). All RNA samples were approximately 1 µg/µl in a total volume of 10 µl. For the two-cycle and IVT-E samples, RNA was diluted with RNase-free water to make a final concentration of 50 ng/µl (equivalent to 30 dissected root sections). <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)
