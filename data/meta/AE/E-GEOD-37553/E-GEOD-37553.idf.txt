Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from LCM-captured Arabidopsis root cells after challenge with Meloidogyne incognita															
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis root cells infested with Meloidogyne incognita 14 or 21 days after inoculation															
Experiment Description	The differentiation of specialized feeding sites in Arabidopsis root cells in response to nematode infestation involves substantial cellular reprogramming of host cells that is not well characterized at the molecular level. Expression data was generated from Arabidopsis root cells undergoing giant cell formation due to nematode infestation and from non-infested control root cells. Cells were laser captured 14 and 21 days after infestation. Samples, collected 14 days post infestation, consisted of three biological replicates per treatment (control root cells or giant cells). RNA samples were isolated from ~150 control cells or from ~80 giant cells using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus, Mountain View, USA). RNA amplifications were carried out with the NuGEN WT-Ovation Pico kit. GSM546568-GSM546577: Control and giant cells collected 21 days post infestation.

Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for infestation with Meloidogyne incognita nematodes according to Hammes et al. Plant J. 2006 48:414-426. Briefly, Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized and sown, five seeds per plate, 30 plates total, in a medium containing 2% sucrose, 0.3% Gamborgâ€™s basal salts, and 0.6 % Phytagel, pH 6.1. Plates were placed at a 45o angle in a short-day chamber.	Data were quantified with the Expression Console (Affymetrix) software application using the MAS5 algorithm	Data were quantified with the Expression Console (Affymetrix) software application using the MAS5 algorithm.	GeneChips were scanned at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Microarray Facility according to standard manufacturer protocols.	Arabidopsis seedlings were infested with Meloidogyne incognita nematodes according to Hammes et al. Plant J. 2006 48:414-426. Briefly, 3 week old Arabidopsis seedlings, 5 per plate, were inoculated with 1,000 M. incognita stage 2 juveniles and placed at an angle in a clear acrylic humid box in a short-day chamber. Twenty-one days after inoculation, control root cells not undergoing giant cell formation (~13,000,000 um2 area) were captured from non-infested regions of the infested root. Control root cells were catapulted using the AutoLPC method directly to P.A.L.M. Adhesive caps.	Arabidopsis seedlings were infested with Meloidogyne incognita nematodes according to Hammes et al.
