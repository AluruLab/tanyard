Samples were harvested at three different time points after transfer: 0 h, 5 h, and 24 h. All sampling points were performed in four independent experiments for Col-0, two independent experiments for wee1-1 and two independent experiments for wee1-2. For each time point in each experiment ï¾±50 root tips were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted from root tissue with TriZol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified with RNneasy kit (Qiagen). The RNA of two independent experiments for Col-0 and WEE1KO were subsequently pooled and used for microarray analysis."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Toon Cools","role":"submitter","email":"tocoo@psb.ugent.be"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21498679,"authors":"Cools T, Iantcheva A, Weimer AK, Boens S, Takahashi N, Maes S, Van den Daele H, Van Isterdael G, Schnittger A, De Veylder L.","title":"The Arabidopsis thaliana checkpoint kinase WEE1 protects against premature vascular differentiation during replication stress","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.110.082768","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Age","value":["5 days"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"GeneticModification","value":["gene_knock_out","none"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["Col-0","wee1-1\/wee1-2"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["Col-0","wee1-1\/wee1-2"]},{"name":"TIME","value":["0 hours","24 hours","5 hours"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":416193,"accession":"P-MTAB-18454"},{"id":416194,"accession":"P-MTAB-18456"},{"id":416192,"accession":"P-MTAB-18455"},{"id":416191,"accession":"P-MTAB-18457"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
