Investigation Title	The rsa3-1 mutation affects global gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana under salt stress.						
Comment[Submitted Name]	The rsa3-1 mutation affects global gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana under salt stress.
Experiment Description	Salt stress is one of the most severe environmental conditions which cause huge losses in crop production worldwide. We identified an essential regulator of salt stress RSA3 and used the Affymetrix whole-genome arrays to study the effect of rsa3-1 mutation on global gene expression under salt stress. A set of genes differentially expressed in rsa3-1 under salt stress are identified. Six-day-old seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (Columbia gl1 expressing RD29A::LUC transgene) and rsa3-1 mutant seedlings subjected to salt stress at 120 mM NaCl for 24 h were used for total RNA extraction and hybridizations with Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips. There are two biological replicates per genotype.

Protocol Description	The datasets were subjected to the Robust Multiarray Averaging (RMA) normalization method. The normalized data were further analyzed and p-values were generated by the affymGUI component of Bioconductor in statistics environment R with the default parameters.Genes were selected by the RankProd (non-paramteric method based on the estimated percentage of false discoveries (p value < 0.05)) method. Normalized expression values presented in Matrix table are log2 values. ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA normalized log2 signal intensity	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 µg total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 10 µg of cRNA was hybridized for 16 h at 45°C on Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	Six-day-old wild type and rsa3-1 mutant plants were subjuected to salt stress at 120 mM NaCl for 24 h.	Arabidopsis seedlings on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium agar plates (1x MS salts, 2% sucrose, 1.2% agar, pH 5.7) were grown under cool, white light (~120 Î¼mol m-2 s-1) at 21 ± 1â„ƒ with a 16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod.	Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.
