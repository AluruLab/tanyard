Experiment Description	"Aim:  To determine the effect of an AtrbohC mutation on the gene expression pattern in primary root tissue, to identify candidate genes acting downstream of AtrbohC, particularly any encoding antioxidant-related proteins, signal transduction components or proteins known to be required for normal root-hair development. Background:  Root-hairs are a model system for investigating plant cell polarity. The root-hair mutant rhd2 (Schiefelbein and Somerville, 1990. Plant Cell, 2:235) has short hairs that burst at their tips, (Jones and Smirnoff, unpublished). RHD2 has been cloned and is identical to AtrbohC (L. Dolan, pers. comm.), which encodes a homologue of the superoxide-generating neutrophil respiratory burst oxidase catalytic subunit gp91phox (Torres et al., 1998. Plant J., 14:365). Superoxide rapidly dismutates to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), suggesting that the rhd2 phenotype may result from reduced H2O2 levels in root-hair cells. Low doses of exogenous antioxidants phenocopy the rhd2 root-hair phenotype in wild-type plants (Jones and Smirnoff, unpublished) further supporting a role for H2O2 in root-hair growth. Fluorescent dyes that detect H2O2 show distinct localisation patterns in growing root-hair cells, (Jones and Smirnoff, unpublished). H2O2 may be an important second messenger in plant cell signalling with proposed roles in the development of cotton fibres (Potikha et al., 1999. Plant Physiol., 119: 849) and in ABA-induced stomatal closure (Zhang et al., 2001. Plant Physiol., 126: 1438). In cultured Arabidopsis cells H2O2 induces gene expression, including that of a gp91phox homologue, (Desikan et al., 1998. J. Exp. Bot., 49: 1767; Desikan, et al., 2000. Free Rad. Biol. Med., 28: 773; Baxter-Burrell et al., 2002. Science, 296: 2026) and activates a MAP kinase cascade (Desikan et al., 1999. J. Exp Bot., 50: 1863). cDNA microarray technology has been used previously to examine the effects of H2O2 on gene expression during oxidative stress (Desikan et al., 2001. Plant Physiol., 127: 159). We wish to investigate the effects of H2O2 on gene expression during root development using the rhd2 mutant. We are currently determining the expression pattern of RHD2. By extracting RNA from the small region of the primary root (for wild-type and rhd2 plants grown in sterile conditions) where root hairs are growing we hope to enrich for root-hair RNAs. This may reveal candidate genes that could be examined more closely at the single-cell level. This approach will provide new insights into the role of H2O2 in root-hair development.

First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using 400 units SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM dNTPs at 42C for 1 hour.  The reaction was then put on ice for 2 mins, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis.  130ul of the second strand reaction mix was added to the 20ul  first strand synthesis reaction. The second strand reaction mix  contained 40 units E. coli DNA polymerase I, 10 units E. coli DNA ligase, 2 units  E. coli RNase H and 0.2 mM dNTPs in a buffer containing 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 6.9), 90 mM KCl, 4.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM (NH4)SO4 and 0.15 mM Ã-NAD+. The reaction was incubated at 16 C for 2 hours.  10 units T4 DNA Polymerase was added and the reaction incubated for a further 5 minutes at 16 C, then the reaction was terminated using EDTA.  The double-stranded cDNA was cleaned up using the cDNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in Vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA using the ENZO BioArray RNA Transcript Labeling Kit supplied by Affymetrix.  The Transcript Labeling kit produces large amounts of hybridizable biotin-labeled RNA targets by in Vitro transcription from bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoters.  The reaction mixture containing Biotin-Labeled ribonucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP with Bio-UTP and Bio-CTP), DTT, RNase inhibitor mix and T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37 C for 5 hrs, gently mixing every 30 minutes during the incubation. This produced an average of 40ug biotin-labeled cRNA . The biotin-labeled cRNA  was cleaned up using the cRNA Cleanup Spin Column supplied in the Affymetrix GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module.  The quantity and quality of the cRNA was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The total amount of cRNA was calculated, the starting quantity of RNA subtracted to give the quantity of adjusted cRNA.  The cRNA was fragmented by metal-induced hydrolysis to break down full-length cRNA to 35-200 base fragments.  15ug of adjusted cRNA was used to prepare 300ul of hybridization cocktail of which 200ul was hybridized with the GeneChip.   ; Protocol Type = labeling; Performers: John,Y,Okyere, Janet,,Higgins"	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
