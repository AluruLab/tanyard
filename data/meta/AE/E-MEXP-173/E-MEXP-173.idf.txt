Publication Status								
Publication Status Term Source REF								
Experiment Description	"In plants, MAPKs are implicated in signalling cascades regulating immediate as well as systemic responses to pathogens. Arabidopsis MAP kinase 4 (MPK4) negatively regulates systemic acquired resistance (SAR) accompanied by the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. MPK4 interacts with and phosphorylates MKS1. Plants that over-express MKS1 exhibit constitutive SAR. RNA was independently isolated three times from each of the three genotypes, wild-type, mpk4 and 35S:mks1 and hybridized to nine Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChips."

Protocol Description	Plant were treated as equaly as possible	plants was grown in a chamber with 16hr light (21C) and 8hr dark (16C).	"Total RNA was isolated from leaves of 3 weaks old plants, using the  TRIzol protocol (invitrogen)."	Total RNA was amplified and Biotin labeled using the Affymetrix Enzo Kit method Described in Affymetrix GeneChip Technical Analysis Manual	"Biotin Labelled cRNA using Affymetrix Enzo Kit (in-vitro transcription method, Affymetrix GeneChip Technical Analysis Manual)"	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	"Transformations:  Gene expression intensities was normalized using R implementation of qspline (Workman et al., 2002; Gautier et al., 2004). An implementation in the statistical language R of the logit-t method (Lemon et al., 2003) applying one-way ANOVA instead of t-test was used to calculate statistical significance for differentially gene expression. only the 800 most significant genes are shown. Gene expression index values were calculated using the PM only R implementation of the Li and Wong (2001) method (Gautier et al., 2004).   # Refs# # Workman C, Jensen LJ, Jarmer H, Berka R, Gautier L, Nielsen HB, Saxild HH, Nielsen C, Brunak S, Knudsen S.
