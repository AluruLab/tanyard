Protocol Description	Affy-GUI, normalized by GCRMA. ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 GCRMA	The samples were 3'-end-labelled with dd-UTP (Roch) by the terminal transferase (TdT, Roche) reaction for 1.5 h at 37 degrees C	RNA probes were labeled using an Affymetrix 3' IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Japan)	Whole Genome Tiling Array was hybridized for 16 hrs, washed, and stained with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate on the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 according to the standard Affymetrix protocol.	Hybridized onto Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome GeneChips® (Affymetrix Inc., USA) according to manifucture's instruction (Affymetrix).	N/A	1/2 MS with 1% sucrose under continuous light	Plants were germinated and grown on plates containing Murashige and Skoog salts, pH 5.7, 1% sucrose (w/v), and 0.5% phytogel (w/v) in continuous light at 22°C.	Samples were prepared by ChIP using an antibody against GFP	Trichomes were removed with forceps from the fifth and sixth rosette leaves of three-week-old wild-type and gtl1-1 mutant plants according to a previously established protocol (Jakoby et al, 2008). Total RNA was extracted from three biological replicates by a Qiagen plant RNeasy kit, and treated with DNaseI (Takara Bio, Japan) following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.	GeneChips were scanned on Affymetrix scanner G7	GeneChips are scanned in a GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix Inc., USA) and CEL files are generated from DAT files using GeneChip® Operating Software (GCOS) software (Affymetrix Inc., USA).
