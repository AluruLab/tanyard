Investigation Title	Transcription profiling of WT and dsr1 Arabidopsis seedlings treated with salicylic acid							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcription profiling of WT and dsr1 Arabidopsis seedlings treated with salicylic acid							
Experiment Description	"Reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are important in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants, but their source is often unclear. We have identified an Arabidopsis mutant that shows loss of stress responsive GSTF8 gene expression in response to the plant defence signal salicylic acid (SA) .  The mutant showed increased susceptibility to both fungal and bacterial pathogens. The dsr1 mutation was mapped to mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH1-1) and dsr1 had reduced SDH activity and a lowered mitochondrial H2O2 production. To better understand the loss of SA-response in dsr1, we performed ATH1 microarray analysis in WT and dsr1 10 hours after a 1 mM SA treatment, a point at which we observed maximal SA-induced GSTF8 promoter activity. 4 day old WT (a Columbia line containing a -800GSTF8::LUC reporter) and dsr1 seedlings (a mutant Columbia line containing a -800GSTF8::LUC) reporterwere treated with water (mock) or 1 mM SA for 40 min.  Ten hours after treatment, samples were collected."

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA  expression value	"cRNA was hybridized to the GeneChip® Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array using a Genechip instrument system with scanner 3000 7G and autoloader for expression array processing and analysis, following manufacturer's protocol.  Labeling, hybing and scanning were performed at the Australian Genome Research Facility."	WT (a Columbia line containing a -800GSTF8::LUC reporter) and dsr1 (an EMS mutant of the Columbia line containing a -800GSTF8::LUC reporter) Arabidopsis seeds were stratified for 3 days at 4ºC.  They were germinated on MS-media and grown in a  21ºC growth room with a 16 hour light/ 8 hour dark cycle.  4 day old seedlings were used in this experiment.	"The raw data files underwent background correction, normalization, probe specific correction, and summary value computation using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method in the Bioconductor package.  To find the differentially expressed genes we utilized the limma package for R to calculate the Log2 fold change, the moderate t-statistic, B value, and the adjusted p value (Benjamini–Hochberg FDR) for each array probe."	Genechips were scanned Affymetrix GeneChip scanner 3000 7G	"5 ml of either water (mock) or 1 mM salicylic acid (SA) was poured onto 56 mm Petri dishes containing 4-day old seedlings. After 40 min of incubation at room temperature, the excess liquid was discarded.  Ten hours after treatment, samples were collected."	"Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen Rneasy kit, following manufacturer's instructions"	"Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 2 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix)."
