We have identified an Arabidopsis mutant that shows loss of stress responsive GSTF8 gene expression in response to the plant defence signal salicylic acid (SA) .  The mutant showed increased susceptibility to both fungal and bacterial pathogens. The dsr1 mutation was mapped to mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH1-1) and dsr1 had reduced SDH activity and a lowered mitochondrial H2O2 production. To better understand the loss of SA-response in dsr1, we performed ATH1 microarray analysis in WT and dsr1 10 hours after a 1 mM SA treatment, a point at which we observed maximal SA-induced GSTF8 promoter activity. 4 day old WT (a Columbia line containing a -800GSTF8::LUC reporter) and dsr1 seedlings (a mutant Columbia line containing a -800GSTF8::LUC) reporterwere treated with water (mock) or 1 mM SA for 40 min.  Ten hours after treatment, samples were collected."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Cynthia Gleason","role":"submitter","email":"cynthia.gleason@csiro.au"},{"contact":"Karam B Singh","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["sdh1 mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["none","salicylic acid"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["sdh1 mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1127842,"accession":"P-GSE22942-2"},{"id":1127837,"accession":"P-GSE22942-1"},{"id":1127843,"accession":"P-GSE22942-4"},{"id":1127844,"accession":"P-GSE22942-3"},{"id":1127840,"accession":"P-GSE22942-6"},{"id":1127841,"accession":"P-GSE22942-5"},{"id":1127839,"accession":"P-GSE22942-8"},{"id":1127838,"accession":"P-GSE22942-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
