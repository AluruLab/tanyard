Parental genomic imbalance particularly affects proliferation of the endosperm, with an increased ratio of paternally to maternally contributed genomes (‘paternal excess’) associated with overproliferation, while maternal excess inhibits endosperm growth. One interpretation is that interploidy crosses disrupt the balance in the seed of active copies of parentally imprinted genes. This is supported by the observation that mutations in imprinted FIS-class genes of Arabidopsis thaliana share many features of the paternal excess phenotype. Here we investigated gene expression underlying parent-of-origin effects in Arabidopsis through transcriptional profiling of siliques generated by interploidy crosses and FIS-class mutants. Two biological replicate samples each of 2xX2x, 2xX4x, 2xX6x, 6xX2x, 4xX2x and fis1X2x and a single sample of msi1. Each sample was hybridised to a separate array."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Sushma Tiwari","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Reiner Schulz","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Reiner Schulz","role":"submitter","email":"reiner.schulz@genetics.kcl.ac.uk"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["5 days after pollination","7 days after flowering"]},{"category":"maternal ecotype","value":["C24","Col-1","Ler"]},{"category":"maternal genetic modification","value":["A9-barnase transgene","fis1-3 (=mea-3\/f644) homozygous mutant","msi1-2 homozygous mutant","none"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"paternal ecotype","value":["C24","Col-1","N\/A"]},{"category":"paternal genetic modification","value":["N\/A","none"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE","value":["5 days after pollination","7 days after flowering"]},{"name":"MATERNAL ECOTYPE","value":["C24","Col-1","Ler"]},{"name":"MATERNAL GENETIC MODIFICATION","value":["A9-barnase transgene","fis1-3 (=mea-3\/f644) homozygous mutant","msi1-2 homozygous mutant","none"]},{"name":"PATERNAL ECOTYPE","value":["C24","Col-1","N\/A"]},{"name":"PATERNAL GENETIC MODIFICATION","value":["N\/A","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":13,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":121107,"accession":"P-GSE20005-8"},{"id":121106,"accession":"P-GSE20005-7"},{"id":121111,"accession":"P-GSE20005-6"},{"id":121108,"accession":"P-GSE20005-5"},{"id":121112,"accession":"P-GSE20005-4"},{"id":121109,"accession":"P-GSE20005-3"},{"id":121110,"accession":"P-GSE20005-2"},{"id":121105,"accession":"P-GSE20005-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":13,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":13,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":13,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":13,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":13,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":13,"isderived":0}]}]}}
