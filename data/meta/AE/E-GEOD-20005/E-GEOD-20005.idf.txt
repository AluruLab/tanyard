Comment[Submitted Name]	Parent-of-origin effects in seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana: Affymetrix
Experiment Description	Crossing plants of the same species but different ploidies can have dramatic effects on seed growth, but little is known about the alterations to transcriptional programmes responsible for this. Parental genomic imbalance particularly affects proliferation of the endosperm, with an increased ratio of paternally to maternally contributed genomes (‘paternal excess’) associated with overproliferation, while maternal excess inhibits endosperm growth. One interpretation is that interploidy crosses disrupt the balance in the seed of active copies of parentally imprinted genes. This is supported by the observation that mutations in imprinted FIS-class genes of Arabidopsis thaliana share many features of the paternal excess phenotype. Here we investigated gene expression underlying parent-of-origin effects in Arabidopsis through transcriptional profiling of siliques generated by interploidy crosses and FIS-class mutants. Two biological replicate samples each of 2xX2x, 2xX4x, 2xX6x, 6xX2x, 4xX2x and fis1X2x and a single sample of msi1. Each sample was hybridised to a separate array.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity and detection p-value<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Labelled cRNA was hybridised according to manufacturer’s protocols (done at NASC: http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/)	Plants were grown at 18hr day cycles at 60% humidity. Male sterile lines were pollinated by the appropriate pollen depending on the cross, and siliques harvested in liquid nitrogen at 5 days after pollination (DAP). For the msi1 sample, the msi1 mutation was introgressed in a A9 barnase male sterile line, siliques were left to elongate in absence of fertilization and were harvested 7 days after flower opening.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100.	Standard manufacturer's protocol (done at NASC: http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/)	none	Total RNA from siliques was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and concentrated using an RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen).	Biotin labelling of cRNA using Affymetrix Enzo Kit according to manufacturer’s protocols (done at NASC: http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/)
