Based on the assumption that their signal transductions are partially shared, inhibitory chemicals for both signal transductions were screened from a commercially-available library. A chemical designated as NJ15 (ethyl 2-[5-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrazole-2-yl]acetate) diminished the growth promotion of both adzuki bean epicotyls and Arabidopsis seedlings, by either the application of BR or auxin. To understand its target site(s), bioassays with a high dependence on either the signal transduction of BR (BR-signaling) or of auxin (AX-signaling), were performed. NJ15 inhibited photomorphogenesis of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the dark, which mainly depends on BR-signaling, while NJ15 also inhibited their gravitropic responses mainly depending on AX-signaling. On the study for the structure-activity relationships of NJ15 analogues, they showed strong correlations on the inhibitory profiles between BR- and AX-signalings. These correlations imply that NJ15 targets the downstream pathway after the integration of BR- and AX-signals. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was used as the wild type (WT) in this study. The Col-0 plants, grown vertically as a gravitropic response assay for 4 days on MS plates, were sprayed with mock or with 10 µM NJ15 (ethyl 2-[5-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrazole-2-yl]acetate) and were gravistimulated by turning then 90° relative to the first direction. After 8 h, plants were harvested and total RNA was extracted with a Total RNA Extraction Kit Mini for plant (RBC Bioscience), then total RNA was subjected to microarray analysis."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Naiyanate Jaroensanti","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Seung-Hyun Park","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Masatoshi Nakajima","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Tadao Asami","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Yuji Nakai","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Ikuya Shirai","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Yuji Nakai","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Jung-Min Yoon","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Masato Otani","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Ken-ichiro Hayashi","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":25351332,"authors":"Jaroensanti N, Yoon JM, Nakai Y, Shirai I, Otani M, Park SH, Hayashi K, Nakajima M, Asami T","title":"Does the brassinosteroid signal pathway in photomorphogenesis overlap with the gravitropic response caused by auxin?","doi":"10.1080\/09168451.2014.925783"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["4 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedling"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["ethyl 2-[5-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrazole-2-yl]acetate","mock"]},{"name":"dose","value":["10 micromolar"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1167578,"accession":"P-GSE57449-5"},{"id":1167577,"accession":"P-GSE57449-6"},{"id":1167576,"accession":"P-GSE57449-1"},{"id":1167580,"accession":"P-GSE57449-2"},{"id":1167581,"accession":"P-GSE57449-3"},{"id":1167579,"accession":"P-GSE57449-4"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
