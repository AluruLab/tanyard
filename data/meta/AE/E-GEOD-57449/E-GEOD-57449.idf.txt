Comment[Submitted Name]	Effect of NJ15 on gene expression profiles in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings									
Experiment Description	Brassinosteroid (BR) and auxin co-regulate plant growth in a process termed cross-talking. Based on the assumption that their signal transductions are partially shared, inhibitory chemicals for both signal transductions were screened from a commercially-available library. A chemical designated as NJ15 (ethyl 2-[5-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrazole-2-yl]acetate) diminished the growth promotion of both adzuki bean epicotyls and Arabidopsis seedlings, by either the application of BR or auxin. To understand its target site(s), bioassays with a high dependence on either the signal transduction of BR (BR-signaling) or of auxin (AX-signaling), were performed. NJ15 inhibited photomorphogenesis of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the dark, which mainly depends on BR-signaling, while NJ15 also inhibited their gravitropic responses mainly depending on AX-signaling. On the study for the structure-activity relationships of NJ15 analogues, they showed strong correlations on the inhibitory profiles between BR- and AX-signalings. These correlations imply that NJ15 targets the downstream pathway after the integration of BR- and AX-signals. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was used as the wild type (WT) in this study. The Col-0 plants, grown vertically as a gravitropic response assay for 4 days on MS plates, were sprayed with mock or with 10 µM NJ15 (ethyl 2-[5-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrazole-2-yl]acetate) and were gravistimulated by turning then 90° relative to the first direction. After 8 h, plants were harvested and total RNA was extracted with a Total RNA Extraction Kit Mini for plant (RBC Bioscience), then total RNA was subjected to microarray analysis.

Protocol Description	CEL files were quantified with the Factor Analysis for Robust Microarray Summarization (FARMS) method, using the statistical language R (R-2.7.2) and Bioconductor 2.2. ID_REF =  VALUE = FARMS summarized signal	biotinylated aRNA was obtained from 100 ng of purified total RNA using a GeneChip 3’ IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).	Following fragmentation, 12.5 ug aRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45ºC on Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450.	For DNA microarray analysis, wild type Col-0 plants, grown vertically as a gravitropic response assay for 4 days on MS plates, were sprayed with mock or with 10 uM NJ15 and were gravistimulated by turning then 90º relative to the first direction. After 8 h, plants were harvested and total RNA was extracted with a Total RNA Extraction Kit Mini for plant (RBC Bioscience), then total RNA was subjected to microarray analysis.	Total RNA was purified with an RNA Extraction Kit Mini for plant (RBC Bioscience).	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.
