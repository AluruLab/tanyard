All plant growth was performed in Percival AR66LX environmental chambers with settings of: 16 hr day\/8hr night cycle, photosynthetic photon flux of 150 µmol m-2 s-1, 50% humidity and temperature of 21C.  All nectary tissues were separately dissected by hand from the flowers of primary inflorescences of ca. 30-35 day-old plants. Due to the small size of nectaries, dissections took place over several days from 4-8 hours after dawn (h.a.d.). Isolated nectaries were pooled in RNAlater™ solution (Ambion, Austin, TX) on ice, and stored at +4°C prior to RNA extraction. Up to two nectaries were collected per flower, with approximately 250-300 nectaries being processed as a single RNA sample.","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":300901,"accession":"P-GSE31537-3","name":"P-GSE31537-3","text":"RNA was extracted from floral nectariferous tissue by mechanical disruption, with a microcentrifuge pestle, and using the RNAqueous®-Micro micro scale RNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) with Plant RNA Isolation Aid (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Following second-strand synthesis, double-stranded cDNA was used in an in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction to generate biotin-labeled, amplified RNA (aRNA). aRNA size distribution was evaluated by conventional denaturing agarose gel analysis according to manufacturer’s instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX).
