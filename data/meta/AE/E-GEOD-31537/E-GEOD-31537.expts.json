Remarkably, the molecular events involved in the development of nectaries, the organs that produce nectar, as well as the synthesis and secretion of nectar itself, are poorly understood. We previously identified a mutant, cwinv4-1, for the gene CELL WALL INVERTASE 4 that failed to produde nectar. This study was undertaken to understand transcriptional changes that occur in cwinv4-1 mature lateral nectaries. RNA was isolated from Stage 14-15 lateral nectaries (secretory stage) of wild-type and cwinv4-1 (mutant) Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia flowers. Two biological replicates were performed for cwinv4-1 and a single biological replicate was performed for wild-type. Normalization was also performed with other pre-existing wild-type lateral nectary array data."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Wayne W Xu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"wayne xu","role":"submitter","email":"wxu@msi.umn.edu"},{"contact":"Brian W Kram","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Clay J Carter","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["30-35 day-old"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"genotype\/variation","value":["cwinv4-1 mutant","wild-type"]},{"category":"organ","value":["pooled lateral nectaries from stage 14-15 flowers"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE\/VARIATION","value":["cwinv4-1 mutant","wild-type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":3,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":300900,"accession":"P-GSE31537-4"},{"id":300901,"accession":"P-GSE31537-3"},{"id":300902,"accession":"P-GSE31537-2"},{"id":300898,"accession":"P-GSE31537-1"},{"id":300904,"accession":"P-GSE31537-7"},{"id":300903,"accession":"P-GSE31537-6"},{"id":300899,"accession":"P-GSE31537-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":3,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":3,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":3,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":3,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":3,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":3,"isderived":0}]}]}}
