Experiment Description	The effect Ds insertion mutation in Ds13-2198-1 line on the gene expression profiles was investigated. The genes for photosynthesis and some transcriptional factors were upregulated while genes for metabolism were downregulated. Experiment Overall Design: To investigate the effect of an strong albino mutation, the genome wide gene expression profiles of plants were examined. Segregants with normal phenotype and albino phenotype obtained from the heterotalic parental line were grown on the same 1/2 MS plate for 3 weeks.

Protocol Type	grow	specified_biomaterial_action	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	
Protocol Description	The plates were kept in a growth chamber with a conditions; 23Â&deg;C, 16 hr light and 8 hr dark cycles	grown on 1/2 MS plant containing 2% sucrose	Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using a RNease MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen).	First-strand of cDNA was synthesized using 16 Â&#956;g of total RNA and SuperScript Double-stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The labeled cRNA was synthesized using BioArray RNA Transcripts Labeling Kit (T7) (ENZO Life Sciences inc.). After labeling, the cRNA was digested partially by incubating in 40 mM Tris-acetate, pH8.0, 100 mM KOAc, 30 mM MgOAc, at 94Â&deg;C for 35 min. Then 30 Â&#956;g cRNA was used for microarrary hybridization.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description:
