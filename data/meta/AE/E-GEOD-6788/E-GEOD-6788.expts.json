Segregants with normal phenotype and albino phenotype obtained from the heterotalic parental line were grown on the same 1\/2 MS plate for 3 weeks."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Takashi Hirayama","role":"submitter","email":"hirayama@gsc.riken.jp"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":17468106,"authors":"Chunjie Tian, Eisuke Chikayama, Yuuri Tsuboi, Takashi Kuromori, Kazuo Shinozaki, Jun Kikuchi, Takashi Hirayama","title":"Top-down phenomics of Arabidopsis thaliana: metabolic profiling by one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transcriptome analysis of albino mutants.","doi":"10.1074\/jbc.M700549200","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["germinating seedling"]},{"category":"Line","value":["Ds insertion line 13-2198-1"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"Phenotype","value":["albino","normal"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"PHENOTYPE","value":["albino","normal"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":424811,"accession":"P-G6788-2"},{"id":62,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown"},{"id":424810,"accession":"P-G6788-1"},{"id":424812,"accession":"P-G6788-4"},{"id":424809,"accession":"P-G6788-3"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
