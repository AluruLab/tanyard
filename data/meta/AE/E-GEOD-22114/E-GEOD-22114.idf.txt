Experiment Description	To massively identify genes that are up-regulated by Cd and in particular transporter genes which might transport peptides or oligopeptides. Four week old  hydroponically-grown Col-0 plants were treated with/without 200uM Cd for 6 hours. Total RNA was extracted from roots and subjected to hybridization with Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays.

Protocol Description	200um Cd for 6 hours	Invitrogen trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	"Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in quarter-strength sterile hydroponic solution at 28 0C with 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycles as described (Arteca and Arteca, 2000; Gong et al., 2003)."	"Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix)."	"Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400."	GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100.	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS 5.0 intensity<br>ABS_CALL = <br>DETECTION P-VALUE =
