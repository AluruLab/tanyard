DREB1a mutant (CS872453) were well-watered until after just bolting (after 24 days growth with the main stem about 1 cm high) when drought treatment was started by withholding water (defined as day 0 for drought treatment). The relative soil moisture content decreased sharply and, after about 80 hours (defined as day 3 for drought treatment), the relative soil moisture content was near 35% of the soil water-holding capacity. The soil water condition was maintained by daily watering until almost all the fruits were mature and ready to harvest. Unopened flower samples were collected from drought treated plants, at day 3, 4, 5."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Zhao SU","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Zhao Su","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Hong Ma","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["Arabidopsis at day 28 after seed germination","Arabidopsis at day 29 after seed germination","Arabidopsis at day 30 after seed germination"]},{"category":"cultivar\/ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["Unopen flower buds"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"AGE","value":["Arabidopsis at day 28 after seed germination","Arabidopsis at day 29 after seed germination","Arabidopsis at day 30 after seed germination"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":900239,"accession":"P-GSE43724-1"},{"id":900244,"accession":"P-GSE43724-4"},{"id":900242,"accession":"P-GSE43724-5"},{"id":900245,"accession":"P-GSE43724-2"},{"id":900243,"accession":"P-GSE43724-3"},{"id":900241,"accession":"P-GSE43724-6"},{"id":900240,"accession":"P-GSE43724-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
