Publication Title	Extensive rearrangement of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial genome elicits cellular conditions for thermotolerance.							
Publication Status	published							
Publication Status Term Source REF	EFO							
Experiment Description	In Arabidposis thaliana, the msh1 recA3 double mutant shows an extensive mitochondrial genome rearrangement and displays pronounced thermotolerance. We use microarray analysis to characterize genes and their response in the double mutant to a heat shock experiment in which plants were exposed to a temperature of 37 C for 2 hours. Wild type and double mutant plant were exposed to a temperature of 37 C for 2 hours and RNA samples were collected for the wild type and the double mutant before and after the heat shock.

Protocol Description	For heat treatment experiments, 8-week-old plants were first transferred to a chamber (Percival Scientific) where they were subjected to heat stress at 37C for approximately 24 hours.	Cold treated seeds were sown directly on soil (Metro Mix 360) and kept in growth chambers at 8- hour daylength at 24 C for 8 weeks and then transferred to a growth chamber with 16-hour daylength at 24 C.	total RNA was extracted from above-ground parts of 8-week-old Col-0 plants and msh1 recA3 double mutant plants (Col-0 background) using TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction procedure followed by purification on Rneasy columns (Qiagen).	According to Affymetrix instructions	RNA was hybridized to individual Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide ATH1 array using manufacturers instructions	According to Affymetrix instructions	Expression data from Affymetrix genechips were normalized using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) method using Bioconductorâs affy package in the R language	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA signal intensity
