The importance of transcriptional regulation has been underscored by the recent flood of global expression analyses, which have confirmed that transcriptional co-regulation of genes that act together is the norm, not the exception. Moreover, many studies suggest that evolutionary change is driven in large part by modifications of transcriptional programs. An essential first step toward deciphering the transcriptional code is to determine the expression pattern of all genes. With this goal in mind, an international effort to develop a gene expression atlas of Arabidopsis has been underway since fall 2003. This project, dubbed AtGenExpress, is funded by the DFG, and will provide the Arabidopsis community with access to a large set of Affymetrix microarray data. As part of this collaboration, we have generated expression data from 80 biologicaly different samples in triplicate. The focus of this data set is on different tissues and different developmental stages in wild type Columbia (Col-0) and various mutants."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Detlef Weigel","role":"submitter","email":null},{"contact":"Markus Schmid","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jan Lohmann","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19575793,"authors":"Obermeier C, Hosseini B, Friedt W, Snowdon R.","title":"Gene expression profiling via LongSAGE in a non-model plant species: a case study in seeds of Brassica napus.","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-10-295","issue":"None","pages":295,"year":2009},{"accession":15806101,"authors":"Schmid M.;
