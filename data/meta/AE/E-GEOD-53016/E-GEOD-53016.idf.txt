Comment[Submitted Name]	Microarray Analysis of myb80 versus Wild-Type Anthers
Experiment Description	Arabidopsis thaliana MYB80 (formerly MYB103) is expressed in the tapetum and microspores between anther developmental  stages 6 and 10. MYB80 encodes a MYB transcription factor that is essential for tapetal and pollen development. In order to identify the genes regulated by MYB80, microarray  technology was employed to analyze the expression levels of genes  that were differentially regulated in the myb80 mutant and wild-  type anthers. Plant Cell 23:2209â€“2224 (2011) three mutant chips vs three wild-type chips

Protocol Description	Microarray data were processed using the ArrayAssist 5.5.1 software provided by Stratagene.  and Strand Life Sciences. ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5.0 signal ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M) DETECTION P-VALUE = 	biotin labeling of cRNA.	samples were hybridized to Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 genome arrays, washed using a Genechip fluidics station, and scanned using the Genechip Scanner 3000	myb80 mutant vs wild-type	Approximately 1000 anthers at stages 5 to 8 were dissected from the wild type and the myb80 mutant for each biological replicate for subsequent RNA isolation	The RNeasy plant kit was used for RNA exraction.	scanned using the Genechip Scanner 3000
