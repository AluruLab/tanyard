Investigation Title	Expression data from NPA treated stems of Arabidopsis thaliana.							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from NPA treated stems of Arabidopsis thaliana.							
Experiment Description	In-vivo induced establishment and activity of the interfascicular cambium in Arabidopsis thaliana stems under NPA treatments. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the establishment and activity of the interfascicular cambium. 3 mm stem pieces were collected after being in treated with NPA for a week in order to stop the polar auxin transport and induce secondary growth. Collected samples were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We aimed to obtain genes responsible for auxin-indueced cambium establishment and activity.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA signal intensity	"Following fragmentation, the aRNAs were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip ATH1 array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400."	Plants were grown for 3 weeks on short days (8 hours light 16 hours dark)under standard conditions and then switched to lond days (16 hours light 8 hours dark)	The data were analyzed using the RMA method using limma and affy libraries in bioconductor (R2.9.0) statiscal package (R).	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.	"Stem fragments of 3 mm in length located 2.5 cm apically from the base were treated with NPA for 7 days, excised with a scalpel and collected for liquid nitrogen freezing."	Total RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturerÂ´s instructions.	"Biotinylated aRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix)."
