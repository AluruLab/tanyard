Experiment Description	10-day-old wild-type and homozygous transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings (overexpressing rice topoisomerase 6 subunit A1; OsTOP6A1) grown under normal growth conditions were used for total RNA isolation. The 5 micrograms of each total RNA sample was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix protocol.  Experiment Overall Design: The experiment involves the study of differential gene expression in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing rice topoisomerase 6 subunit A1 (OsTOP6A1) cDNA as compared to wild-type.Three biological replicates for each sample were used for microarray analysis.

Protocol Type	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	
Protocol Description	Seeds were surface sterilized with 2% sodium hypochlorite and 0.01% triton X-100 for 5 min followed by rinsing in sterile water for 5 times. Seeds were then suspended in 0.1% agar solution and dispensed on 0.8% agar-gelled MS medium containing 2% sucrose. Plates were sealed and shifted to cold room for 72 h to break dormancy and facilitate uniform germination and then transferred to culture room under continuous illumination.	TRIzol reagent	"Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, Affymetrix)."
