The transcription profile of both cell types were also generated. Cell-types of interest expressing specifically Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) were isolated from the rest of the root using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). 11 arrays were generated from plants grown in control and salt conditions. All seedlings grew in one tank were collected and correspond to one biological sample. Two control biological replicates were used for pericycle and 3 for cortical cells. By comparison from control microarray, 6 others arrays from salt treated plant (3 for each cell types) were used to identified salt responsive genes. The salt treatment was done on day 6 and 7 with increment of 25mM every 24h."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Ute Baumann","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Mark Tester","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Baastian Bargmann","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"aurelie evrard","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Kenneth Birnbaum","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Alex Johnson","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Aurelie Evrard","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"cell type","value":["cortex cells","pericycle cells"]},{"category":"growth conditions","value":["5 days control condition + 2 days salt condition","7 days control condition"]},{"category":"line","value":["J1551","J2731"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"CELL TYPE","value":["cortex cells","pericycle cells"]},{"name":"GROWTH CONDITIONS","value":["5 days control condition + 2 days salt condition","7 days control condition"]},{"name":"LINE","value":["J1551","J2731"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":11,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":987561,"accession":"P-GSE44307-6"},{"id":987560,"accession":"P-GSE44307-7"},{"id":987565,"accession":"P-GSE44307-4"},{"id":987562,"accession":"P-GSE44307-5"},{"id":987564,"accession":"P-GSE44307-2"},{"id":987563,"accession":"P-GSE44307-3"},{"id":987559,"accession":"P-GSE44307-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":11,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":11,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":11,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":11,"isderived":0}]}]}}
