Protocol Description	Array images were acquired with Agilent's dual-laser microarray scanner and signal intensities were extracted from the scanned images with dedicated Agilent Feature Extraction software (Agilent technologies). The outliers and the abnormal features were flagged and the data was normalized using the intra-array percentile shift normalization (threshold of 75 and above) and median based inter-array normalization. The GeneSpring software (Agilent technologies) was used to calculate the intensity ratios and fold changes. All the genes with a P value below 0.05 and a fold change above 2 were chosen for further analysis. ID_REF =  VALUE = normalized signal	All of the raw data (*.CEL files) were then analyzed using the affylmGUI package in the statistical computing environment R All genes with a P value < 0.05 and a fold-change > 2 were chosen for further analysis ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA	Microarray analysis was performed using Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Probe Name version). In total 150ng of total RNA was used to prepare Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled probe with the help of low RNA input linear amplification/labeling kit (Agilent technologies) and 1.65Âµg of Labeled cRNA probes were fragmented using fragmentation buffer (Agilent Technologies) and hybridized to the Arabidopsis arrays according to manufacturerâs instructions.	Total RNA from rdm4 and C24 WT seedlings with or without cold treatment (0, 3 or 48 h) was and used to make biotin-labeled cRNA targets. Two biological replicates from different growth chambers were prepared for each combination of ecotype and cold treatment.	Microarray analysis was performed using Agilent-021169 Arabidopsis 4 Oligo Microarray (V4) (Probe Name version). In total 150ng of total RNA was used to prepare Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled probe with the help of low RNA input linear amplification/labeling kit (Agilent technologies) and 1.65Âµg of Labeled cRNA probes were fragmented using fragmentation buffer (Agilent Technologies) and hybridized to the Arabidopsis arrays according to manufacturerâs instructions.	Fragmented cRNAs (15 Î¼g) were hybridized to the 24K GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.	Two-week-old seedlings were transferred to 4 degree for 0, 3, and 48 h. Plant materials were then collected for RNA extraction.	Arabidopsis seeds of RDM4 overexpression lines and Col WT were sown in MS plates and grown at 23/18Â°C in a growth room with a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle at 150 Î¼mol m-2s-1 and 70% relative humidity	Arabidopsis seeds of rdm4 mutant and Col WT were sown in MS plates and grown at 23/18Â°C in a growth room with a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle at 150 Î¼mol m-2s-1 and 70% relative humidity	Total RNA was extracted and purified from leaves of at least 30 seedlings per plate using QIAGEN-RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to guidelines specified by the manufacturer. Two biological replicates were prepared for each combination. RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop-ND 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNA quality was assessed by agarose gel analysis and using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Samples with the RNA integrity number of 7.5 and above were chosen for further analysis.	The arrays were scanned using the high resolution array scanner (Agilent technologies) with the appropriate settings for the one color gene expression arrays after hybridization.	The arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix), and raw image files were converted to probe set data (*.CEL files), using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software according to the manufacturerâs instructions.
