Protocol Description	"We isolated the pistils at a stage between late 11 to late 12 floral stages. The gynoecia were dissected out of the flowers with a syringe needle (BD Micro-Fine, Franklin Lakes, USA) under a dissection scope (Leica Microsystem, Bensheim, Germany) and placed into a RNA protecting solution (RNA-Later, Ambion Inc., Austin, USA). In order to get statistically relevant data, three replicate tissue samples of wild-type and coa were harvested and extracted. Each tissue sample represented approximately 100 to 200 gynoecia, which yielded on average of 30 µg total RNA, a sufficient amount for the Affmetrix Gene Chip© hybridization procedure (manufacturers instructions)."	"The coatlique (coa) mutant was identified in Arabidopsis thaliana var. Landsberg (erecta mutant) (Ler) background and Ler was used as a wild-type control in the microarray experiments. Prior to transplanting, seeds were sown on Murashige and Skoog media (1% sucrose and 0.9% agar, pH 5.7) supplemented with appropriate selection markers and stratified for two days at 4°C. The seeds were germinated and grown for up to 15 days under 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycles at 22°C. Plants were then transplanted into soil (ED73 with Bims, Universal Erde, Germany) and grown in green house conditions under a 16 hours photoperiod at 22°C and 60% to 70% relative humidity."	"RNA was extracted from the gynoecia using TRIZOL according to the manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). The RNA was purified on an RNA column (RNAeasy, Qiagen, Basel Switzerland) according to the manufacturers instructions. At least 15 ug of each total RNA sample (each sample is hybridized on a separate chip) was used to start the cDNA synthesis."	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
