The gynoecia were dissected out of the flowers with a syringe needle (BD Micro-Fine, Franklin Lakes, USA) under a dissection scope (Leica Microsystem, Bensheim, Germany) and placed into a RNA protecting solution (RNA-Later, Ambion Inc., Austin, USA). In order to get statistically relevant data, three replicate tissue samples of wild-type and coa were harvested and extracted. Each tissue sample represented approximately 100 to 200 gynoecia, which yielded on average of 30 µg total RNA, a sufficient amount for the Affmetrix Gene Chip© hybridization procedure (manufacturer’s instructions).","type":"specified_biomaterial_action","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":838842,"accession":"P-MEXP-88478","name":"P-MEXP-88478","text":"The coatlique (coa) mutant was identified in Arabidopsis thaliana var.
