Plants were grown in a 50-mL glass beaker containing a segment (20 mM in height) of a 50-mL Falcon centrifuge tube with triangular openings at bottom to allow for liquid flow. On top of the tube was a disc of polypropylene mesh (250-micron pore size, 25 mM in diameter). Beakers initially contained 25 mL of sterile medium (described above) and approximately 50 surface-sterilized seeds evenly distributed on the mesh disc. On d 5, 5 mL of medium was removed from the beaker to allow shoots to stay above the medium liquid. The beaker top was covered with three layers of aluminum foil to keep the culture sterile.","type":"grow","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":446993,"accession":"P-GSE18984-3","name":"P-GSE18984-3","text":"Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol","type":"nucleic_acid_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":446992,"accession":"P-GSE18984-4","name":"P-GSE18984-4","text":"Labelled using protocol described in Affymetrix manual \"3' IVT Express Kit User Manual\"","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":446996,"accession":"P-GSE18984-5","name":"P-GSE18984-5","text":"Biotin Labelled cRNA using \"Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit\", according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA","type":"hybridization","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":446994,"accession":"P-GSE18984-6","name":"P-GSE18984-6","text":"Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.","type":"image_aquisition","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":446991,"accession":"P-GSE18984-7","name":"P-GSE18984-7","text":"Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm.
