Experiment Description	We compared the transcriptome of homozygous mutants for AtCesA4 and AtCesA6 (cellulose synthase genes) to their heterozygous counterparts that have a wild type phenotype. All plants were 4-weeks-old and grown under short day conditions. 10 samples were used in this experiment: 3 each homozygous and heterozygous AtCesA4 plants, and 2 each homozygous and heterozygous AtCesA6 plants.

Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	image_aquisition	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation
Protocol Description	Qiagen RNAeasy kit protocol	Labelled using protocol described in manual "Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual", One-Cycle target labelling	Biotin Labelled cRNA using "Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit", according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0-calculated signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call
