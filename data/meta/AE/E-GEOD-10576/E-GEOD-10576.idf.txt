Protocol Description	Seedlings were grown for 5 days before transfer to -Fe media.  Transfers were staggered such that all roots were harvested within 3 hours of each other on the sixth day of growth.  Roots were cut with a razor blade 0.5 mm below the root/hypocotyl junction and collected into RNA extraction buffer.  Approximately 320 roots were collected per replicate, with two biological replicates being performed per time point.  Samples were briefly sonicated to disrupt the tissue.	Seedlings were grown for 5 days before transfer to standard media or standard -Fe media.  24 hours after transferring seedlings to media, roots were cut into 4 regions using a razor blade.	Samples were prepared as in Birnbaum et al. (2005) Nat. Methods for roots grown under standard conditions.  For -Fe treated samples, roots were transferred to -Fe media for 24 hours before protoplasting.	Samples were prepared as in Birnbaum et al. (2005) except that roots were transferred to -Fe media for 24 hours before protoplasting or harvested without protoplasting.  Protoplasted cells were passed through the FACS device with all cells being collected.	Seeds were surface sterilized for 2 minutes in 70% ethanol, the ethanol was removed, then replaced with 30% Bleach and 0.02% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes. Seeds were rinsed 3 times with sterile water, stratified for 4ËC for 2 days, then placed on standard media. Standard media is 1X Murashige and Skoog salt mixture in which ferrous sulfate is replaced with 100mM Fe(III)-EDTA, 0.5g/L MES, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH.  â"Fe media is 1X Murashige and Skoog salt mixture in which ferrous sulfate is replaced with 0.3mM Ferrozine. Nylon mesh was placed on top of the solidified media and seeds were planted at ~20 seeds/cm in two rows.	Seeds were surface sterilized for 2 minutes in 70% ethanol, the ethanol was removed, then replaced with 30% Bleach and 0.02% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes. Seeds were rinsed 3 times with sterile water, stratified for 4ËC for 2 days, then placed on standard media. Standard media is 1X Murashige and Skoog salt mixture in which ferrous sulfate is replaced with 100mM Fe(III)-EDTA, 0.5g/L MES, 1% sucrose, 1% agar and adjusted to pH 5.7 with KOH.  â"Fe media is 1X Murashige and Skoog salt mixture in which ferrous sulfate is replaced with 0.3mM Ferrozine.   Nylon mesh was placed on top of the solidified media and seeds were evenly placed on the mesh in a single row at a density of ~2/cm for all experiments.	Approximately 320 roots were collected per replicate.  Samples were briefly sonicated to disrupt the tissue.  RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 15 roots were dissected for each replicate and pooled.  Samples were collected into RNA extraction buffer and briefly sonicated to disrupt the tissue.  RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH).	RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH).	Fragmented cRNA probes were prepared using the one-cycle amplification protocol by Affymetrix.	Fragmented cRNA probes were prepared using the two-cycle amplification protocol by Affymetrix.
