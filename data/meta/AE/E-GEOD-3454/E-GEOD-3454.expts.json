Keywords: Whole seedlings of wild-type (Ws) and the mutant (rop10-1) treated with or without ABA 12 Arabidopsis ATH1 chips were purchased from Affymetrix. Total RNA was extracted and purified from 1ÂµM ABA-treated or non-treated Ws and rop10-1. Each genotype\/treatment has three biological replicates. Probe labeling, array hybridization and scanning were done by the University of California-Irvine DNA Microarray Facility."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Zhi-Liang Zheng","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"},{"contact":"Yihong Zhao","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Zeyu Xin","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":16258012}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":403971,"accession":"P-GSE3454-6"},{"id":403968,"accession":"P-GSE3454-5"},{"id":403969,"accession":"P-GSE3454-4"},{"id":403967,"accession":"P-GSE3454-3"},{"id":403970,"accession":"P-GSE3454-2"},{"id":403966,"accession":"P-GSE3454-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
