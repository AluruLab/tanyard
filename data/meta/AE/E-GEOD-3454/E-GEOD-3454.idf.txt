Investigation Title	Transcriptome analysis of ROP10 GTPase-mediated abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in Arabidopsis					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome analysis of ROP10 GTPase-mediated abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in Arabidopsis
Experiment Description	In this study, we have identified genes that are respectively activated and repressed by the low concentration of ABA and show that ROP10 gates a specific subset of genes that are responsive only to a low ABA concentration. Keywords: Whole seedlings of wild-type (Ws) and the mutant (rop10-1) treated with or without ABA 12 Arabidopsis ATH1 chips were purchased from Affymetrix. Total RNA was extracted and purified from 1µM ABA-treated or non-treated Ws and rop10-1. Each genotype/treatment has three biological replicates. Probe labeling, array hybridization and scanning were done by the University of California-Irvine DNA Microarray Facility.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = GCOS 1.1.1 software-calculated Signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), marginal (M), or no call (NC)<br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 'detection p-value', p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	standard Affymetrix procedures	standard Affymetrix procedures	Approximately 100 mg of 7-day old seedlings were frozen and ground in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using an TRIzol kit (Invitrogen) and purified by RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Approximately 10 µg of total RNA was processed to produce biotinylated cRNA targets.
