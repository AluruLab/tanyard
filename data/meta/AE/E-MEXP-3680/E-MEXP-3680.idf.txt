Experiment Description	Two null mutants of MYB103 were found to have decreased expression of FERULATE-5-HYDROXYLASE and reduced syringyl lignin in the basal inflorescence stem. The aim with this microarray experiment was to investigate the transcriptome of these myb103 mutants to better understand the mechanism underlying MYB103 action.

Protocol Description	Two Arabidopsis T-DNA KO mutant lines (myb103-1 and myb103-2, respectively) were compared against WT (Col-0).	GeneChip IVT Labeling Kit (http://media.affymetrix.com/support/downloads/manuals/expression_analysis_technical_manual.pdf)(Parameters: Amplification = RNA polymerases, Mass unit = Micro gram)	GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit (http://media.affymetrix.com/support/downloads/manuals/expression_analysis_technical_manual.pdf)(Parameters: Chamber type = Affymetrix- GeneChip Hyb Oven 640, Quantity of label target used = 0, Mass unit = Micro gram, Tiny time unit = seconds, Volume unit = Nano litre, temperature = 45)	GeneChip Expression Wash, Stain and Scan User Manual, P/N 702731 (https://www.affymetrix.com/user/login.jsp?toURL=/support/file_download.affx?onloadforward=/support/downloads/manuals/wash_stain_scan_cartridge_arrays_manual.pdf)(Parameters: Scanning hardware = 418 [Affymetrix], Scanning software = MAS/GCOS/GREX [Affymetrix])	For each genotype, 18 plants in total were randomly pooled into 3 biological replicates, each consisting of 6 individual plants.	Seeds were sown and plants routinely grown in soil (16 h light, 24C/19C; 150 uE/m2 per s; 70% humidity). In all experiments, the different genotypes were carefully randomized according to position during growth.(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)	Basal 1-9 cm stem segments of 25 cm high plants were frozen and homogenized. Total RNA (see above) was purified and concentrated with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit #74204 (Qiagen, http://www.qiagen.com). RNA quality and quantity were checked with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (http://www.agilent.com) and NanoDrop (http://www.nanodrop.com), respectively, and 4 ug per sample was submitted to ATLAS Biolabs (http://www.atlas-biolabs.com) for whole-transcriptome analysis (ATLAS Biolabs Affymetrix 3' Expression Full Service) using the Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays (http://www.affymetrix.com).(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)
