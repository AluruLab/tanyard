This is a collection of CEL files of mRNA profiles of the total steady-state mRNAs and polysomal mRNAs of distinct cell types of the whole root and shoot of 7-d-old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. The cell type specific mRNA populations are those present in ribosome-mRNA complexes. This sub-population of mRNAs was obtained by first establishing a collection of Arabidopsis lines that express a FLAG-epitope tagged ribosomal protein L18 (RPL18) directed by promoters expressed in specific cell types and regions. Thirteen different promoter:FLAG-RPL18 lines were used. The targeted cell types and promoters included root atrichoblast (non-hair) epidermal cells (pGL2), root endodermis (pSCR), root stelar xylem and pericycle (pWOL, pSHR), root phloem companion cells (phloem CC) (pSUC2, pSultr2;2), root proliferating cells (pRPL11C), root cortex meristematic cells (pCO2), root cortex elongation\/maturation cells (pPEP), shoot mesophyll (pRBCS), shoot epidermis (pCER5), shoot guard cells (pKAT1), shoot bundle sheath (pSultr2;2), shoot phloem CC (pSUC2) and shoot trichomes (pGL2). A CaMV 35S promoter:FLAG-RPL18 line was used to obtain the polysomal mRNA of multiple cell types. The immunopurification of ribosome-mRNA complexes of specific cell types\/regions was accomplished by the method described in Zanetti et al. (Plant Physiology, 138, 624-635; 2005). Hybridization of the immunopurified mRNAs to the Affymetrix ATH1 DNA microarray platform and subsequent data analysis permitted the identification of transcripts that are enriched or depleted in specific cell types\/regions of roots and shoots. The dataset includes samples from cell types\/regions from seedlings grown under control conditions and cell types\/regions of seedlings exposed to low oxygen stress (hypoxia) for 2 h. Experiment Overall Design: 79 samples, 2 conditions (2 h hypoxia stress, 2 h non-stress), 2 RNA pools (Total mRNA and polysomal mRNA), 2 organs, 13 promoter lines, 2-4 replicates"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Angelika Mustroph","role":"submitter","email":"angelika.mustroph@web.de"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19843695,"authors":"Mustroph A, Zanetti ME, Jang CJ, Holtan HE, Repetti PP, Galbraith DW, Girke T, Bailey-Serres J.","title":"Profiling translatomes of discrete cell populations resolves altered cellular priorities during hypoxia in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0906131106","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["7 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["p35S:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pCER5:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pCO2:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pGL2:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pKAT1:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pPEP:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pRBCS:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pRPL11C:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pSCR:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pSHR:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pSUC2:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pSultr2;2:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pWOL:His6FLAG-RPL18B"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root","shoot"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["p35S:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pCER5:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pCO2:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pGL2:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pKAT1:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pPEP:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pRBCS:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pRPL11C:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pSCR:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pSHR:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pSUC2:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pSultr2;2:His6FLAG-RPL18B","pWOL:His6FLAG-RPL18B"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["control","hypoxia"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["root","shoot"]},{"name":"RNA","value":["polysomal mRNA","total mRNA"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":79,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1050845,"accession":"P-G14502-5"},{"id":1050843,"accession":"P-G14502-4"},{"id":1050844,"accession":"P-G14502-3"},{"id":1050846,"accession":"P-G14502-2"},{"id":1050847,"accession":"P-G14502-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":79,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":79,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":79,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":79,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":79,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":79,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":79,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":79,"isderived":0}]}]}}
