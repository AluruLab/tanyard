Experiment Description	We collected bending cotyledon seed compartments from 7 micron paraffin sections using the Leica LMD6000 system in order to identify the mRNAs present in different compartments from seeds containing linear cotyledon stage embryos. For the purposes of this study we captured 5 compartments: embyro proper, cellularized peripherial endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat and seed coat, in addition to serial sections encompasing the entire linear cotyledon stage seed. Bending cotyledon stage seed compartments were isolated using the LMD6000 system. Total RNA was amplified and hybridized with Affymetrix ATH1 Arabidopsis array for 14 samples (embryo proper, micropylar endosperm, peripherial endosperm, chalazal endosperm, chalazal seed coat, seed coat and whole seeds, 2 biological replicates each).

Protocol Description	Total RNA was extracted using the RNaqueous Micro-Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) using a modified protocol incorporating an on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen RNase-Free DNase Set) during column washes.	Siliques containing bending cotyledon stage seeds were collected from 38-46 day old plants. Siliques were sub-divided and fixed in 3:1 (v/v) ethanol to acetic acid and embedded in paraffin. Microdissection of compartments was carried out on sections using a Leica LMD6000 system.	Plants were grown in a Conviron chamber under continuous light with fluorescent lamps at 20Â°C and 50%-70% relative humidity.	5 to 6 ng of total RNA was amplified using the WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA). cDNAs were fragmented and labeled with NuGEN FL-Ovationâ¢ cDNA Biotin Module V2.	Following fragmentation, five micrograms of cDNA was hybridized for 18 hr at 45Â°C with the GeneChip ATH1 Arabidopsis Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained using the EukGE-WS2V4_450 protocol in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G System.	The data were analyzed with the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating system 1.4 (GCOS) using default analysis settings and global scaling as a normalization method. The mean target intensity of each array was set to 500.
