Other ABA biosynthesis genes are also greatly reduced in ced1 under osmotic stress. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression under osmotic stress treatment and identified distinct classes of up\/down-regulated genes in the stress pathway. Arabidopsis seedlings were selected at 16 days with 6hr PEG treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. From Norther data we have known some of well-known stress responsive gene were significantly changed. We sought to obtain whole gene expression to analysis which genes were affected in the osmotic stress pathway."}],"provider":[{"contact":"zhenyu wang","role":"submitter","email":"wzy43155@gmail.com"},{"contact":"Jiankang Zhu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Zhenyu Wang","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21610183,"authors":"Wang ZY, Xiong L, Li W, Zhu JK, Zhu J.","title":"The plant cuticle is required for osmotic stress regulation of abscisic acid biosynthesis and osmotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.110.081943","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["gl1-Col0"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["ced1 mutant","wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["ced1 mutant","wild_type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":443060,"accession":"P-GSE25889-1"},{"id":443062,"accession":"P-GSE25889-3"},{"id":443061,"accession":"P-GSE25889-2"},{"id":443066,"accession":"P-GSE25889-5"},{"id":443067,"accession":"P-GSE25889-4"},{"id":443063,"accession":"P-GSE25889-7"},{"id":443064,"accession":"P-GSE25889-6"},{"id":443065,"accession":"P-GSE25889-8"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0}]}]}}
