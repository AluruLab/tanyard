Investigation Title	expression data of WT and ced1 under osmotic stress							
Comment[Submitted Name]	expression data of WT and ced1 under osmotic stress							
Experiment Description	ced1 mutant has reduced expression of NCED3  in response to osmotic stress (polyethylene glycol) treatments compared to the wild type.  Other ABA biosynthesis genes are also greatly reduced in ced1 under osmotic stress. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression under osmotic stress treatment and identified distinct classes of up/down-regulated genes in the stress pathway. Arabidopsis seedlings were selected at 16 days with 6hr PEG treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. From Norther data we have known some of well-known stress responsive gene were significantly changed. We sought to obtain whole gene expression to analysis which genes were affected in the osmotic stress pathway.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the AffymetrixFluidics Station 450.	Arabidopsis seedlings on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium agar plates were routinely grown under continuous white  light (~75 μmol m-2 s -1) at 23±1℃.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100.	GeneChips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000	16 day old seedlings were transfer to plate contained 40% PEG solution for 6hr	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
