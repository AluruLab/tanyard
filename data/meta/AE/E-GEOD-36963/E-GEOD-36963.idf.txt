Investigation Title	Expression data from 11-day-old antisense BoEMF2.1 broccoli							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from 11-day-old antisense BoEMF2.1 broccoli
Experiment Description	EMF2 genes play an important function in inhibiting reproductive programs during vegetative stage of plant development. We knocked down the expression of endogenous EMF2 genes in broccoli by introduing a 35S::antisenseBoEMF2.1 contruct. The transgenic broccoli with knocking-down expression of endogenous EMF2s showed aberrant phenotypes during development. We used microarrays to study the global programme of gene expression and to identified genes misexpressed in broccoli with knocking-down expression of endogenous EMF2 genes 11-day-old seedlings of broccoli harboring the empty vector pCAMBIA1380 and that harboring 35S::antisenseBoEMF2.1 (asBoEMF2.1) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity<br>ABS_CALL = <br>Detection p-value = 	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16.5 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Seedlings were grown on 0.8 % agar plates with half-strength of MS and 1.5 % sucrose under long day condition (16h light/ 8h dark) at 21 centigrade.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 500.	GeneChips were scanned using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G	Seedlings of p1380 vector-only broccoli and antisenseBoEMF2.1 broccoli grown on MS plates under long day condition (16h/8h) for 11 days.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 701021 Rev. 5, Affymetrix).
