The analysis was performed in WT plants (Ler), as well as mutants plants in which the expression of EBS and SHL was previously shown to be null, namely ebs and shl-2 mutant. To perform this study, plants were grown for 18 days under short days (SD) conditions (8h light, 16h darkness) in MS solid media. Three independent biological samples were hybridized separately."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Alfonso Mouriz","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Manuel Pineiro","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Leticia Lopez-Gonzalez","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Alfonso Mouriz-Villar","role":"submitter","email":"mouriz@gmail.com"},{"contact":"Jose A Jarillo","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":25281686,"authors":"L�pez-Gonz�lez L, Mouriz A, Narro-Diego L, Bustos R, Mart�nez-Zapater JM, Jarillo JA, Pi�eiro M","title":"Chromatin-Dependent Repression of the Arabidopsis Floral Integrator Genes Involves Plant Specific PHD-Containing Proteins."}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Landsberg erecta"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["EBS","shl-2","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedling"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["EBS","shl-2","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1127230,"accession":"P-GSE33270-2"},{"id":1127226,"accession":"P-GSE33270-1"},{"id":1127231,"accession":"P-GSE33270-4"},{"id":1127232,"accession":"P-GSE33270-3"},{"id":1127228,"accession":"P-GSE33270-6"},{"id":1127229,"accession":"P-GSE33270-5"},{"id":1127227,"accession":"P-GSE33270-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
