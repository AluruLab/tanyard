Transgenic Arabidopsis plants (LAT52-HF-RPL18) harboring an epitope tagged ribosomal protein L18 driven by the pollen specific promoter (ProLAT52) were used for mRNA-ribosome complex isolation. After collection of polyribosomal (polysomal) complexes from self-pollinated (in vivo), unpollinated styles (buds), and in vitro-cultured pollen tubes, the actively translated mRNAs (the translatome) were purified, amplified to antisense RNA (aRNA). These aRNAs were hybridized to microarrays.Three independent biological replicates samples of aRNA from Bud, in vivo, and in vitro polysomal mRNA (translatomes) were hybridized to GeneChips to produce CEL files."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Piyada Juntawong","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Guang-Yuh Jauh","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Julia Bailey-Serres","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Shih Y Lin","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Shih Yun Lin","role":"submitter","email":"linsiun@gmail.com"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["in vitro cultured pollen tube","stage 11-12 floral buds","stage 14 floral buds"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["LAT52-HF-RPL18 transgenic"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["pollen grains and tubes","pollen tube"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE","value":["in vitro cultured pollen tube","stage 11-12 floral buds","stage 14 floral buds"]},{"name":"ORGANISM PART","value":["pollen grains and tubes","pollen tube"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":952128,"accession":"P-GSE43299-5"},{"id":952129,"accession":"P-GSE43299-3"},{"id":952127,"accession":"P-GSE43299-6"},{"id":952131,"accession":"P-GSE43299-4"},{"id":952125,"accession":"P-GSE43299-1"},{"id":952126,"accession":"P-GSE43299-7"},{"id":952130,"accession":"P-GSE43299-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
