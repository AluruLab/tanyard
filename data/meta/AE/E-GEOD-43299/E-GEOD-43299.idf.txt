Comment[Submitted Name]	Translatome of floral buds, in vivo pollinated pollen tubes, and in vitro cultured pollen grains/tubes from LAT52-HF-RPL18 Arabidopsis
Experiment Description	Little is known of the transcriptome of in vivo-grown pollen tubes, due to the difficulty of collection of pollen tubes elongating within the maternal gynoecium.We obtained the mRNAs undergoing translation (the translatome) of in vivo-grown pollen tubes from self-pollinated gynoecia of Arabidopsis thaliana(Col-0). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants (LAT52-HF-RPL18) harboring an epitope tagged ribosomal protein L18 driven by the pollen specific promoter (ProLAT52) were used for mRNA-ribosome complex isolation. After collection of polyribosomal (polysomal) complexes from self-pollinated (in vivo), unpollinated styles (buds), and in vitro-cultured pollen tubes, the actively translated mRNAs (the translatome) were purified, amplified to antisense RNA (aRNA). These aRNAs were hybridized to microarrays.Three independent biological replicates samples of aRNA from Bud, in vivo, and in vitro polysomal mRNA (translatomes) were hybridized to GeneChips to produce CEL files.

Protocol Description	The per-array data normalization was used Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0). ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS 5.0 signal ABS_CALL = indicating whether the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M) DETECTION P-VALUE = 	The aRNAs from three different samples were labeled with biotin by in vitro transcription in amplification kit and their integrity was examined by use of an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).	The labeled aRNA was fragmented to 35-200 nt and Bud (4.9 Œºg), in vivo (12 Œºg) and in vitro (18 Œºg) samples were hybridized to GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 genome arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) for 16.5 hr at 45∞C.	To isolate the polysomal RNAs from ‚ÄúBud‚Äù stage, ‚Äúin vivo‚Äù-grown pollen tubes, and ‚Äúin vitro‚Äù-cultured pollen tube in LAT52-HF-RPL18 Arabidopsis, the ribosome-mRNA complexes of these three samples were separated through sucrose density gradients and the polysome region of the gradient pooled for mRNA extraction. Prior to polysome extraction, we used 1250 Œºl of polysome extraction buffer (PEB) (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 200 mM KCl, 25 mM EGTA, pH 8.3, 36 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 mg mL-1 cycloheximide, 50 mg mL-1 chloramphenicol, 0.5 mg mL-1, heparin, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) Tween 20, 1% (w/v) Brij-35, 2% (v/v) polyoxyethylene, and 1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid) (Mustroph et al., 2009) to treat each sample. The crude extract of each sample in PEB was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4∞C, the supernatant passed through a shredder column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to remove residues and a spectrophotometer (DUÆ 648B, Beckman, IN, USA) used to detect the OD260 units of the flow through. The purified crude extract (500 Œºl, 30-40 OD260 units) was loaded on a 4.2 mL sucrose (20%-60%) density gradient and ultracentrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 3.5 hr at 4∞C in a SW 41Ti rotor (Beckman, IN, USA). After centrifugation, the absorbance profile of the gradient was detected using a UV monitor (Monitor UVIS-920, GE Healthcare, NJ, USA) at Absorbance 260 nm. Fractions containing polysomes were collected for immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged ribosome complexes by use of FLAG antibody-associated agarose beads (ANTI-FLAGÆ M2-Agarose from mouse, Sigma-Aldrich).	LAT52-HF-RPL18 transgenic Arabidopsis plants were grown in growth chamber under 18-h light/6-h dark at 22∞C	Polysomal RNA of the ‚ÄúBud‚Äù, ‚Äúin vivo‚Äù-grown pollen tubes and ‚Äúin vitro‚Äù-cultured pollen tubes samples were further purified with an RNA purification kit (RNeasy Mini Kit, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), and then were treated with RNA amplification kit (MessageAmpTMPremier RNA amplification kit, Austin, TX, USA) to increase the RNA amount by single linear amplification and generate the antisense RNA (aRNA).	The array signal was scanned by use of the Affymetrix GeneChipÆ Scanner 3000 scanner (Agilent Technologies).
