Investigation Title	DNA-damaging agent and immune inducer synergistically induced defence gene expression in Arabidopsis						
Comment[Submitted Name]	DNA-damaging agent and immune inducer synergistically induced defence gene expression in Arabidopsis						
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis seedlings grown after DNA-damaging agent bleomycin (BLM) and/or immune inducer 2, 6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA) treatment to identify synergistically induced defence genes						
Experiment Description	We used microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes after DNA-damaging agent bleomycin (BLM) and/or immune inducer 2, 6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA) treatment. We focused on those genes that were synergistically induced by co-treatment (BLM+INA). Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with 4 μg/ml BLM and/or low INA (10 μM). There are 4 treatments: control (CK), INA, BLM and BLM+INA. Each treatments have three biological replicates. There are 12 samples in total.

Protocol Description	The data were normalized with RMA algorithm using Gene-Spring GX default analysis settings ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA signal intensity	RNA probes were labelled using MessageAmp Premier RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion).	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized on Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip (Santa Clara, CA, U.S.A).	Seedlings were treated with 4 μg/ml BLM and/or low INA (10 μM)	Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on MS plates at 21-24�C, 16-hour day length, 60% relative humidity.	Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen)	GeneChips were scanned using the Axon Genepix Scanner (Genepix 4000B).
