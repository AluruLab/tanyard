And linear statistical model in Limma package (Smyth et al., 2005) from Bioconductor was used to identify significant differently expressed genes between two groups.","type":"feature_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0},{"id":26698,"accession":"P-GSE14788-7","name":"P-GSE14788-7","text":"Standand Affymetrix protocol","type":"labeling","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0},{"id":26701,"accession":"P-GSE14788-8","name":"P-GSE14788-8","text":"Standand Affymetrix protocol","type":"hybridization","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0},{"id":26700,"accession":"P-GSE14788-9","name":"P-GSE14788-9","text":"triazol","type":"nucleic_acid_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":0}]}}
