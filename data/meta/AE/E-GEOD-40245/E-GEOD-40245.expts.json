We used the whole-genome microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression mediated by glucose and TOR. Arabidopsis WT and estradiol inducible RNAi-tor seedlings were germinated in low light condition for 3 days to deplete seed nutrient supply. Fifteen mM glucose was adding back to reactivate the quiescent seedlings and the samples were harvested for RNA isolation.  Transcript profiles were analyzed and compared between with and without glucose treatment to identify early glucose-TOR target genes. Each experimental condition was repeated three times and total 12 samples were generated."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Chengbin Xiang","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Yan Xiong","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Matthew McCormack","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jen Sheen","role":"submitter","email":"sheen@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu"},{"contact":"Jen Sheen","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23542588,"authors":"Xiong Y, McCormack M, Li L, Hall Q, Xiang C, Sheen J","title":"Glucose-TOR signalling reprograms the transcriptome and activates meristems.","doi":"10.1038\/nature12030"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["3 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["tor mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]},{"category":"RNA interference","value":["none","tor RNAi"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["glucose","none"]},{"name":"dose","value":["0 micromolar","15 micromolar"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["tor mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1168248,"accession":"P-GSE40245-5"},{"id":1168247,"accession":"P-GSE40245-6"},{"id":1168246,"accession":"P-GSE40245-7"},{"id":1168245,"accession":"P-GSE40245-1"},{"id":1168249,"accession":"P-GSE40245-2"},{"id":1168251,"accession":"P-GSE40245-3"},{"id":1168250,"accession":"P-GSE40245-4"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
