Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of the tinkerbell (tink) mutation of Arabidopsis.									
Experiment Description	Mitogen-activated dual-specificity MAPK phosphatases are important negative regulators in the MAPK signalling pathways responsible for many essential processes in plants.  In a screen for mutants with reduced organ size we have identified a mutation in the active site of the dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase INDOLE-3-BUTYRIC ACID-RESPONSE5 (IBR5) that we named tinkerbell (tink) due to its small size. Analysis of the tink mutant indicates that IBR5 acts as a novel regulator of organ size that changes the rate of growth in petals and leaves. Organ size and shape regulation by IBR5 acts independently of the KLU growth-regulatory pathway.  Microarray analysis of tink/ibr5-6 mutants identified a likely role for this phosphatase in male gametophyte development.  We show that IBR5 may influence the size and shape of petals through auxin and TCP growth regulatory pathways. 6 samples, three mutant replicates, three wild type replicates.

Protocol Description	Data were gcrma normalized using R/Bioconductor. ID_REF =  VALUE = GCRMA normalized signal intensities	Performed by NASC Affymetrix service, Nottingham, UK.	Performed by NASC Affymetrix service, Nottingham, UK.	The tink/ibr5-6 mutant was isolated from an EMS-mutagenesized population in the klu-2 background and backcrossed three times to Ler plants to isolate tink/ibr5-6 single mutants. klu-2 mutants are described in Anastisou et al., 2007 (PMID: 18061566).	Growth conditions were as described in Disch et al., 2006 (PMID: 16461280).	RNA was extracted from inflorescences with young flower buds from individual tink/ibr5-6 mutant or Ler plants with three replicates using the RNEasy kit (Qiagen)	Performed by NASC Affymetrix service, Nottingham, UK.
