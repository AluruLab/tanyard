In a screen for mutants with reduced organ size we have identified a mutation in the active site of the dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase INDOLE-3-BUTYRIC ACID-RESPONSE5 (IBR5) that we named tinkerbell (tink) due to its small size. Analysis of the tink mutant indicates that IBR5 acts as a novel regulator of organ size that changes the rate of growth in petals and leaves. Organ size and shape regulation by IBR5 acts independently of the KLU growth-regulatory pathway.  Microarray analysis of tink\/ibr5-6 mutants identified a likely role for this phosphatase in male gametophyte development.  We show that IBR5 may influence the size and shape of petals through auxin and TCP growth regulatory pathways. 6 samples, three mutant replicates, three wild type replicates."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Tomoaki Sakamoto","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Michael W Bevan","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Michael Lenhard","role":"submitter","email":"michael.lenhard@uni-potsdam.de"},{"contact":"Christian Kappel","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Tetsuya Kurata","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Ottoline Leyser","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Sally Ward","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Kim L Johnson","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Sascha Ramm","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Michael Lenhard","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":26147117,"authors":"Johnson KL, Ramm S, Kappel C, Ward S, Leyser O, Sakamoto T, Kurata T, Bevan MW, Lenhard M","title":"The Tinkerbell (Tink) Mutation Identifies the Dual-Specificity MAPK Phosphatase INDOLE-3-BUTYRIC ACID-RESPONSE5 (IBR5) as a Novel Regulator of Organ Size in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0131103"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Ler"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["tink\/ibr5-6","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["inflorescence"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["tink\/ibr5-6","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1168068,"accession":"P-GSE66419-1"},{"id":1168073,"accession":"P-GSE66419-3"},{"id":1168074,"accession":"P-GSE66419-2"},{"id":1168071,"accession":"P-GSE66419-5"},{"id":1168072,"accession":"P-GSE66419-4"},{"id":1168069,"accession":"P-GSE66419-7"},{"id":1168070,"accession":"P-GSE66419-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
