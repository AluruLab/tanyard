Investigation Title	Gene expression in pif3 mutant under dark and in wt under Red 1h and Red 18h						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Gene expression in pif3 mutant under dark and in wt under Red 1h and Red 18h						
Experiment Description	PIF3 plays a role as repressor of photomorphogenesis in darkness. To identify PIF3-regulated genes that might be implementing this action, we have performed whole-genome expression analysis in the pif3 mutant. Seeds were surface-sterilized and plated on GM medium without sucrose, stratified at 4ºC in the dark for 4 days, exposed to white light for 3 hours to induce germination, and placed in a growth chamber at 21ºC in darkness for 4 days (D0h) and 4 days and 1 hour (D1h). For Rc treatments seedlings were moved to Rc growth chambers at 21ºC  for 1 (R1h) and 18 (R18h) hours.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = rosetta normalized signal intensity	GeneChips were scanned using an Agilent Scanner.	Following fragmentation, 15 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on ATH1 array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	Total RNA was prepared using the method of Chang et al.1993 (Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 11: 113) followed by further purification using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia,CA).	Seeds were surface-sterilized and plated on GM medium without sucrose, stratified at 4C in the dark for 4 days, exposed to white light for 3 hours to induce germination, and placed in a growth chamber at 21C in darkness for 4 days (D0h) and 4 days and 1 hour (D1h). For Rc treatments seedlings were moved to Rc growth chambers at 21C for 1 (R1h) and 18 (R18h) hours.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 ug total RNA.	The dara were analyzed with Rosetta Resolver platform performing a Benjamini Hochberg FDR error-corrected analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Ratio Error Model as described in Weng et al. 2006 (Bioinformatics 22: 1111) The matrix table consists of sequence (probe set) intensity values following normalisation with the Rosetta Affymetrix Error Model Normalisation Method, as described in Weng et al (2006), Bioinformatics 22, pp1111-1121, and as implemented in the Rosetta Resolver system, version 7.2.
