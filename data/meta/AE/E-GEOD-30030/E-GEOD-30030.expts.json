To identify PIF3-regulated genes that might be implementing this action, we have performed whole-genome expression analysis in the pif3 mutant. Seeds were surface-sterilized and plated on GM medium without sucrose, stratified at 4ºC in the dark for 4 days, exposed to white light for 3 hours to induce germination, and placed in a growth chamber at 21ºC in darkness for 4 days (D0h) and 4 days and 1 hour (D1h). For Rc treatments seedlings were moved to Rc growth chambers at 21ºC  for 1 (R1h) and 18 (R18h) hours."}],"provider":[{"contact":"M Sentandreu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Elena Monte","role":"submitter","email":"elena.monte@cid.csic.es"},{"contact":"J M Tepperman","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"P H Quail","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"E Monte","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":22108407,"authors":"Sentandreu M, Martín G, González-Schain N, Leivar P, Soy J, Tepperman JM, Quail PH, Monte E","title":"Functional profiling identifies genes involved in organ-specific branches of the PIF3 regulatory network in Arabidopsis."}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["pif3 mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"growth condition","value":["4 days and 1 hour in darkness","4 days and 18 hour in darkness","4 days in darkness","4 days in darkness and 1 hour in red continuous light","4 days in darkness and 18 hours in red continuous light"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedling"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["pif3 mutant","wild type"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["4 days and 1 hour in darkness","4 days and 18 hour in darkness","4 days in darkness","4 days in darkness and 1 hour in red continuous light","4 days in darkness and 18 hours in red continuous light"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":21,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1135906,"accession":"P-GSE30030-2"},{"id":1135905,"accession":"P-GSE30030-3"},{"id":1135900,"accession":"P-GSE30030-1"},{"id":1135901,"accession":"P-GSE30030-6"},{"id":1135902,"accession":"P-GSE30030-7"},{"id":1135904,"accession":"P-GSE30030-4"},{"id":1135903,"accession":"P-GSE30030-5"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":21,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":21,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":21,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":21,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":21,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":21,"isderived":0}]}]}}
