Protocol Description	Plants were sprayed with 5uM beta-estradiol in water.	Plants were grown in growth chambers at 70% humidity and daily cycles of 16 h light and 8 h darkness at the specified temperature.	Total RNA was using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction. The quality of the isolated RNA was determined with a NanoDrop ND 1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Delaware, USA) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). Only samples with a 260 nm/280 nm ratio between 1.82.1 and a 28S/18S ratio within 1.52 were processed further.	plant material of the specified number of plants was pooled per replicate	One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix, P/N 900431, Santa Clara, CA)	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
