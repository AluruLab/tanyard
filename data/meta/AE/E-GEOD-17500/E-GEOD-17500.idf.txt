Investigation Title	Effect of auxin signaling on Pseudomonas syinrgae pv tomato DC3000 response							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Effect of auxin signaling on Pseudomonas syinrgae pv tomato DC3000 response							
Experiment Description	Expression data 24hrs after PstDC3000 inoculation in Col-0, 35S:AFB1 and 35S:miR393. We used microarrays to investigated the effect of auxin signaling on PstDC3000 response.  Keywords: Alexandre,Robert-Seilaniantz Plants were syringe infiltrated with 10^6cfu/ml of PstDc3000 or water. Leaves were harvested 24hrs after inoculation

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = signal calculated by RMA	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on Arabidopsis Genome ATH1 microarray. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.	Plants were grown in short day environment (8hrs light/16 hrs dark) for 5 weeks at 20C.	background corrected using RMA, quantile normalized, values summarised by median-polish	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000	Leaves were inoculated with PstDc3000 at 10^6cfu/ml or with water. Tissues were harvested at 24hrs post inoculation	Trizol extraction according to the manufacturer instruction. The total RNA was then DNAse treated using the Qiagen DNAse. Purification was performed using the RNAeasy columns following the manufacturer instruction	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
