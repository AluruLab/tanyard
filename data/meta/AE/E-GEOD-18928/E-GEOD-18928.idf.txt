Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from 5-week-old Arabidopsis						
Experiment Description	AGO4 plays an important role in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). RdDM on specific genomic loci have the potential to silence the nearby protein coding gene. We used wild-type La-er and ago4-1 mutant Arabidopsis to identify AGO4-regulated genes. Five-weeks wild-type and ago4-1 mutant RNA were used for Affymetrix microarrays. Differentially expressed genes were identified to study the role of AGO4 in regulating plant development.
