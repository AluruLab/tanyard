Although Cs+ is chemically similar to potassium (K+), and much is known about K+ transport mechanisms, it is not clear through which K+ transport mechanisms Cs+ is taken up by plant roots. In this study, the role of AtHAK5 in high affinity K+ and Cs+ uptake was characterized. It is demonstrated that AtHAK5 is localized to the plasma membrane under conditions of K+ deprivation, when it is expressed. 9 samples were used in this experiment."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Corrina Hampton","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC)","role":"submitter","email":"affy@arabidopsis.info"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["Boyes key 3.9"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["cngc1-3","cngc19 knockout","wild type"]},{"category":"germplasm","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["cngc1-3","cngc19 knockout","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1128324,"accession":"P-GSE20222-6"},{"id":1128323,"accession":"P-GSE20222-7"},{"id":1128326,"accession":"P-GSE20222-4"},{"id":1128325,"accession":"P-GSE20222-5"},{"id":1128322,"accession":"P-GSE20222-1"},{"id":1128328,"accession":"P-GSE20222-3"},{"id":1128327,"accession":"P-GSE20222-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
