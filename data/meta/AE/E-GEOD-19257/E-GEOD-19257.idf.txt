Investigation Title	Transcriptome differences between two vitamin C-deficient mutants and wild type						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Transcriptome differences between two vitamin C-deficient mutants and wild type						
Experiment Description	The Arabidopsis mutant vtc2 is vitamin C-deficient and high light sensitive (Mueller-Moule et al., 2002. Plant Physiol 128: 970-977; Mueller-Moule et al., 2003. Plant Physiol 133: 748-760). Even though the VTC2 gene has been cloned (Jander et al., 2002. Plant Physiol 129: 440-450), its function is still unclear. The goal of this experiment is to learn more about the function of the VTC2 gene by determining differences in the transcriptomes of wild type and the vtc2-1 mutant. In order to differentiate between VTC2 gene-specific differences and vitamin C-induced differences, a second vitamin C-deficient mutant vtc1-1 (Conklin et al., 1996. PNAS 93: 9970-9974) is included in the experiment. The plants will be grown on agar plates in a growth chamber with a 16 hour light (about 40 umol photons m(-2)s(-1))/8 hour dark regime at 20C for 14 days to stage 1.04. Whole plants will be collected and total RNA will be isolated using the Qiagen Rneasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 9 samples were used in this experiment.

Protocol Description	ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity ABS_CALL = the call in an absolute analysis that indicates if the transcript was present (P), absent (A), or marginal (M) DETECTION P-VALUE = p-value that indicates the significance level of the detection call	Scanned according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA.	Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Seedlings harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA extracted as described in the Qiagen RNAeasy kit.	After seed sterilisation, seeds were kept in water for 3 days in the dark at 4 degrees. Seeds were sterilised by surface treatment with 25% bleach (Danklorix, Germany) and 0.02% Triton X-100 for 6 minutes followed by three washes with de-ionized water. Growth chamber Agar minimal plant nutrient agar plates (Haughn and Somerville, 1986.Mol Gen Genet 204:430-434). Plants were grown for 14 days to stage 1.04 (4 rosette leaves > 1mm).	Labelled using protocol described in manual &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual&quot;, One-Cycle target labelling	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
