We chose several CDPKs for investigation, some which have been implicated in the  response to abiotic stress (Sheen 1996), others whose function is unknown.  We constructed gene fusions with YFP as a 3_in-frame fusion to investigate cellular\/tissue expression; the gene-specific DNA includes 1.5kb 5'-untranslated region. Plants carrying the Cdpk6-yfp construct show a marked alteration in phenotype: the (probable)-heterozygote is small and bushy and the (probable)-homozygote shows an excess of flower primordia and insufficient leaf development.  These plants do not survive.  The expression of Cdpk6 as measured using a GUS-promoter fusion is confined to the developing flowerheads although the Cdpk6-YFP plants show more widespread expression. We have made RNA from two separate insertion lines of Cdpk6-YFP and from Col-0 plants carrying the aequorin gene all grown on selective medium.  We cannot collect homozygote seed; the seedlings germinating from seeds collected from heterzygous plants grown on selective medium will consist of both heterozygous and homozygous individuals.
