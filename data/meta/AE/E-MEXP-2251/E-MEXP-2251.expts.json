The aim of the study was to identify natural targets of this factor and to compare it to targets of drd1 another major key factor required for the RNA silencing process in plants. We performed transcriptome analysis to identify targets of this factor. For this we used whole plants at seedling stage, isolated total RNA and then used the standard Affymetrix pipeline\/chemistry. The mutated transcription factor, dms4-1 was compared to its respective wildtype (EDT, Col-O background). For microarray analysis THREE biological replicates were run.<br><\/br><br><\/br>For transcriptome comparison we analyzed another factor required for the process RNA-directed DNA methylation in plants, drd1 also identified in a forward genetic screen and previously characterized in depth (Kanno et al. Current Biology, 14, 801-805, (2004), Huettel et al. EMBO J. 25, 2828-2836 (2006)). For transcriptome analysis two alleles of drd1 (drd1-1 and drd1-6) with two biological replicates each was compared to the respective wildtype DT, which served as starting material in this forward genetic screen (DT, Col-0 background). For drd1 mutants and DT wildtype analysis 10 day old seedlings were used as starting matieral while for dms4-1 and EDT 3 week old seedlings were analyzed."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Bruno Huettel","role":"submitter","email":"huettel@mpiz-koeln.mpg.de"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20010803,"authors":"Kanno T, Bucher E, Daxinger L, Huettel B, Kreil DP, Breinig F, Lind M, Schmitt MJ, Simon SA, Gurazada SG, Meyers BC, Lorkovic ZJ, Matzke AJ, Matzke M","title":"RNA-directed DNA methylation and plant development require an IWR1-type transcription factor.","doi":"10.1038\/embor.2009.246","issue":1,"pages":"65-71","publication":"EMBO Rep","volume":11,"year":2010,"status":"submitted"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["10 day","21 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["dms4 mutant","drd1-1 mutant","drd1-6 mutant","DT wild type","EDT wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"age","value":["10 day","21 day"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["dms4 mutant","drd1-1 mutant","drd1-6 mutant","DT wild type genotype","EDT wild type genotype"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":14,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":125,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v5_450"},{"id":1137120,"accession":"P-MTAB-4695"},{"id":1137119,"accession":"P-MTAB-4694"},{"id":77,"accession":"P-AFFY-2"},{"id":1137118,"accession":"P-MTAB-4696"},{"id":163,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:MAS4:ExpressionCall"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":14,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":14,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":14,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":14,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
