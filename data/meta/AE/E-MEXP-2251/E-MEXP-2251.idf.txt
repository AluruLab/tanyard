Experiment Description	We identified in a forward genetic screen a novel factor required for RNA-directed DNA methylation (IWR1-like transcription factor). The aim of the study was to identify natural targets of this factor and to compare it to targets of drd1 another major key factor required for the RNA silencing process in plants. We performed transcriptome analysis to identify targets of this factor. For this we used whole plants at seedling stage, isolated total RNA and then used the standard Affymetrix pipeline/chemistry. The mutated transcription factor, dms4-1 was compared to its respective wildtype (EDT, Col-O background). For microarray analysis THREE biological replicates were run.<br><br>For transcriptome comparison we analyzed another factor required for the process RNA-directed DNA methylation in plants, drd1 also identified in a forward genetic screen and previously characterized in depth (Kanno et al. Current Biology, 14, 801-805, (2004), Huettel et al. EMBO J. 25, 2828-2836 (2006)). For transcriptome analysis two alleles of drd1 (drd1-1 and drd1-6) with two biological replicates each was compared to the respective wildtype DT, which served as starting material in this forward genetic screen (DT, Col-0 background). For drd1 mutants and DT wildtype analysis 10 day old seedlings were used as starting matieral while for dms4-1 and EDT 3 week old seedlings were analyzed.

Protocol Description	Total RNA was extracted and purified with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop ND-1000, Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 ug total RNA by using the one-cycle cDNA synthesis kit (GeneChip One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents, Affymetrix, High Wycombe, U.K.) <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Seeds were sterilized and germinated on sterile solid Murashige and Skoog medium in petri dishes. The dishes were placed at 4 C for 3 d, then moved to a Percival incubator and grown at 23 C in a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle. Seedlings used in experiments were 21 d old and harvested at 3 PM.<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, min temperature = 23, temperature unit = C)	Seeds were sterilized and germinated on sterile solid Murashige and Skoog medium in petri dishes.
