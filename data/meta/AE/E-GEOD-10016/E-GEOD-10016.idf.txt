Experiment Description	Usually starch is nearly depleted at the end of the night. To induce a gradual depletion of carbon, we have analysed the global response of transcripts during an extension of the night, where carbon becomes severely limiting from about four hours onwards. Experiment Overall Design: Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes were harvested in successive timpoints in an extended night situation.

Protocol Type	grow	specified_biomaterial_action	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	
Protocol Description	Plants were germinated for 7 days (16 h light at 20Â&deg;C, night at 6Â&deg;C, 200 Â&#956;E fluorescent light, 60â"70% relative humidity), transferred to short-day condition (8 h light at 20Â&deg;C, dark at 16Â&deg;C, 180 Â&#956;E fluorescent light, 60â"70% relative humidity), picked after day 14 into pots and incubated under short day further 7 days. The Col-0 ecotype grew from day 22 on for 11 days in a 14-h photoperiod (20Â&deg;C, 150 Â&#956;E fluorescent light, 60â"70% relative humidity)	Plants were harvested in the vegetative state with 3 rosettes per sample, and typically at least 5 replicate samples. Rosettes were transferred into liquid nitrogen in darkness.	Trizol extraction	Approximately 10 Â&#956;g of total RNA was processed to produce biotinylated cRNA targets.	standard Affymetrix procedures	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description:
