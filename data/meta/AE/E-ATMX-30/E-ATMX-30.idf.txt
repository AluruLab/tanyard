Protocol Description	No NaCl treatment, only water supply	Treated with 250mM NaCl solution for 24 hr	Arabidopsis plants were sown in potting mix,BIO-PLUG2 purchased from Hungnongseed Co. (Seoul,Korea)and grown at 21ºC(day)/23ºC(night) and 60% relative humidity under a cycle of regime fluorescent light at 200 uEinsteins/m2/sec (16 hr) and dark (8 hr).	Total RNAs were isolated from the rosette leaves of individual plants using the Concert Plant RNA Purification Reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Concentration of total RNA was measured by spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan).Ten micrograms of total RNA was converted to the first strand DNA using the SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with a T7-oligo (dT)24 primer containing T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence (GenoTech, Korea). Then, double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript Choice system.	Biotinylated complementary RNA (cRNA) was synthesized from 1 µg of cDNA by in vitro transcription using a BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics, NY, USA). Labeled cRNA was purified using an RNeasy mini kit and was fragmented by heating at 94oC for 35 min in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris-acetate (pH 8.1), 100 mM KOAc, and 30 mM MgOAc to produce a distribution of RNA fragments ranging in size from approximately 35 to 200 nucleotides.
