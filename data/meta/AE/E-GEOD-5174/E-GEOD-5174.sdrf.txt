GSE5174GSM116725	Arabidopsis thaliana	EFO	http://purl.org/obo/owl/NCBITaxon#NCBITaxon_3702	seedling:  Cold-treated seeds in MS plates were placed in chambers at 24oC in the dark with hydrocarbon-free airflow for three days, after which some of the chambers were connected to ethylene gas at 10 ppm while the others remained on air treatment. Four hours later the seedlings of each plate were quickly collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Total RNA was prepared from both air-treated and ethylene-treated etiolated seedlings of Arabidopsis Col-0, ein2-5 and ein5-1 using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Biotinylated target RNA was prepared from 16 ?g of total RNA using the procedure described by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, a primer encoding a T7 RNA polymerase promoter fused to (dT)24 (Genset Oligos, La Jolla, CA) was used to prime double-stranded cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript Choice System (Life Technologies). The resulting cDNA was transcribed in vitro using the BioArray High-Yield RNA Tran-script Labeling Kit (Enzo Biochem, New York, NY) in the presence of biotinylated UTP and CTP to produce biotinylated target complementary RNA (cRNA). The labeled target cRNA was purified, fragmented, and hybridized to Arabidopsis microoarrays (Affymetrix whole genome tiling, and ATH1 gene expression arrays) according to protocols provided by the manufacturer in a hybridization oven model 640 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The arrays were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin using a GeneChip Fluidics Station model 400 and then scanned with a Gene Array Scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Scanned images were processed and quantified using GeneChip Suite 3.2. Genespring software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) was used to manage and filter the array data. Each measurement was divided by the 50.0th percentile of all measurements in that sample.  The percentile was calculated with all normalized measurements above 10.  For samples where the bottom tenth percentile was less than the negative of the 50.0th percentile, it was used as a background, and subtracted from all the other genes first. Experiments were carried out in duplicate and hybridized to two sets of expression chips.  Expression values were analyzed using GeneSpring software version 4.2 (Silicon  Genetics, Redwood, California)..
