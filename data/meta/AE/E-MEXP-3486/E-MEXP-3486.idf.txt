Protocol Name	P-MTAB-24479	P-MTAB-24480	P-MTAB-24481
Protocol Description	The normalized data was obtained by using RMA. All chips were normalized together using robust multichip average.  Median polish was used for the probe level summary.	Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit according to the kit protocol. <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type Col-0, transgenic 35S::AtFAAH line (OE11a-1) and homozygous knockout line (Atfaah -/-) were planted on MS media and seedlings were grown for 14 days in 14h/10 h light/dark cycle prior to RNA isolation for arrays.
