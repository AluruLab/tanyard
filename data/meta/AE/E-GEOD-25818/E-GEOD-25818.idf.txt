Comment[ArrayExpressAccession]	E-GEOD-25818										Public Release Date	2010-12-03										Investigation Title	"Gene expression analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana infected with Pseudomonas syringae, a strain of defense-eliciting bacteria"										Comment[Submitted Name]	"GENE-counter, a computational and statistical pipeline for assessing RNA-Seq data for genome-wide expression differences"										Experiment Description	"RNA-Sequencing is a transformative method that captures the quantitative dynamics of a transcriptome with exquisite sensitivity and single-base resolution. There are, however, few computational pipelines for RNA-Seq with statistical tests that evince sufficient robustness and power as demanded by the difficult combination of small sample sizes and high variability in sequence read counts. To this end, we developed GENE-counter, a complete software pipeline for analyzing RNA-Seq data for genome-wide expression differences between replicated treatment groups. One important component of GENE-counter is a statistical test based on the NBP parameterization of the negative binomial distribution for identifying differentially expressed genome features. We used GENE-counter to analyze RNA-Seq data derived from Arabidopsis thaliana infected with a strain of defense-eliciting bacteria. We identified 308 genes that were differentially induced. Using alternative methods, we provided support for the induced expression and biological relevance of a substantial proportion of the genes. These results suggest the NBP parameterization of the negative binomial distribution is well suited for explaining RNA-Seq data and the statistical test makes GENE-counter a powerful pipeline for studying genome-wide expression changes. GENE-counter is freely available at http://changlab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/. Our RNA-seq data is uploaded on the NCBI short read archive (SRA) under the SRA025952. 6 samples total.  Two treatments with three biological replicates each. MgCl2 is the mock treatment, and hrcC is the experimental treatment."										Date of Experiment											Term Source Name	EFO										Term Source Version											Term Source File	http://efo.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/efo/trunk/src/efoinowl/efo.owl										Person Last Name	Chang	Cumbie	Kimbrel	Di	Schafer	Wilhelm	Fox	Sullivan	Curzon	Carrington	MocklerPerson First Name	Jeff	Jason	Jeffrey	Yanming	Daniel	Larry	Samuel	Christopher	Aron	James	ToddPerson Mid Initials		S	A		W	J	E	M	D	C	CPerson Email	changj@cgrb.oregonstate.edu										Person Affiliation	Oregon State University										Person Phone	5417375279										Person Fax											Person Address	"Oregon State University, 3097 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, Oregon, USA"										Person Roles	submitter										Person Roles Term Source REF											Person Roles Term Accession Number											Normalization Type											Normalization Term Accession Number											Normalization Term Source REF											Replicate Type											Replicate Term Accession Number											Replicate Term Source REF											Experimental Design											Experimental Design Term Accession Number											Experimental Design Term Source REF											Quality Control Type											Quality Control Term Accession Number											Quality Control Term Source REF											Protocol Name	P-GSE25818-1	P-GSE25818-5	P-GSE25818-4	P-GSE25818-2	P-GSE25818-3	P-GSE25818-6	P-GSE25818-8	P-GSE25818-7			Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA data	Arrays were scanned with an Affymetrix GeneChip® Scanner 3000 at 570nm.	10 µg from each experimental sample along with Affymetrix eukaryotic hybridization controls were hybridized for 16 hours to arabidopsis genome arrays (ATH1) in an Affymetrix GeneChip® Hybridization Oven 640	"Liquid N2, phenol:chloroform, Qiagen RNAeasy, DNAse"	"Biotinylated cRNA was synthesized from the double stranded cDNA using T7 RNA polymerase and a biotin-conjugated pseudouridine containing nucleotide mixture provided in the IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)"	RMA	program-name = Expression Console	affymetrix-algorithm-version = 1.0			Protocol Software											Protocol Hardware											Protocol Contact											Protocol Type	bioassay_data_transformation	image_aquisition	hybridization	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	feature_extraction	feature_extraction	feature_extraction			Protocol Term Source REF											Protocol Term Accession Number											Experimental Factor Name	growth condition	dose									Experimental Factor Type	growth condition	dose									Experimental Factor Term Source REF											Experimental Factor Term Accession Number											Comment[SecondaryAccession]	GSE25818										Comment[GEOLastUpdateDate]	2010-12-02										Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis after inoculation with Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 hrcC mutant										Comment[AEExperimentType]	transcription profiling by array										Comment[GEOReleaseDate]	2010-12-03										Comment[ArrayExpressSubmissionDate]	2010-12-02										SDRF File	E-GEOD-25818.sdrf.txt
