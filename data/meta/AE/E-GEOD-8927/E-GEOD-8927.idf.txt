Few genes related to defense and secondary metabolism were altered. Experiment Overall Design: Surfactant (preference 0.25%) treated plants were used as carrier control group and EC50 concentration of glyphosate was used as the herbicide treatment group. Each of the control and treatment group consisted of 3 biological replicates and each biological replicates comprised leaves from 10 individual plants. RNA was extracted at 24h post treatment to study the transcriptional alterations caused by the herbicide treatment.					Protocol Name	P-G8927-1	P-G8927-2	P-G8927-5	P-G8927-3	P-AFFY-6	P-G8927-4Protocol Type	grow	specified_biomaterial_action	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformationProtocol Description	"Seeds of A. thaliana, col 0 were stratified at 3-4C for 2-4 days and then grown under 22-23C, 16h photoperiod and 175-210 micromol per sec light intensity"	14 days old plants were sprayed with surfactant and herbicide solutions in a RIC spray chamber (RC-5000-100EP)	Triazol extraction of total RNA and subsequent purification with Rneasy mini spin columns	"Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 4 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix)."
