New Phytologist 204: 368-379. Seeds of Col-0, myb72-2 and oxMYB72 were surface sterilized and sown on 1 X Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar-solidified medium supplemented with 1% sucrose (Murashige & Skoog, 1962). After 2 d of stratification at 4°C, the Petri dishes were positioned vertically and transferred toa growth chamber (22°C; 12 h : 12 h light : dark; light intensity, 100 μmol\/m2\/s). Uniform 5-d-old seedlings were transferred to new plates containing agar-solidified Hoagland medium composed of KNO3 (5 mM), KH2PO4 (2 mM), Ca(NO3)2 (5 mM), MgSO4 (2 mM), KCl (50 μM), H3BO3 (50 μM), MnSO4 (10 μM), ZnSO4 (2 μM), CuSO4 (1.5 μM), (NH4)6Mo7O24 (0.075 μM) and MES (2.5 mM). The concentration of Fe(III)EDTA was adjusted to 50 μM and the pH of the medium to 5.8. Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417 (now renamed into Pseudomonas simiae WCS417) was cultured at 28°C on King’s medium B (KB) agar plates supplemented with 50 μg\/ml of rifampicin. After 24 h of growth, cells were collected in 10 mM MgSO4, washed twice by centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 g and finally resuspended in 10mM MgSO4. For in vitro assays, the bacterial titer was adjusted to the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.01 (10-E7 colony-forming units (CFU)\/ml).","type":"growth protocol","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":1187643,"accession":"P-GSE77806-4","name":null,"text":"Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
