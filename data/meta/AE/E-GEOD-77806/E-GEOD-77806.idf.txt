Comment[Submitted Name]	Role of root-specific transcription factor MYB72 in regulation of Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417-mediated changes in gene expression in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana
Experiment Description	â¢ Selected soil-borne rhizobacteria can trigger an induced systemic resistance (ISR) that is effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the root-specific transcription factor MYB72 is required for the onset of ISR, but is also associated with plant survival under conditions of iron deficiency. Here we investigated the role of MYB72 in both processes.  â¢ To identify MYB72 target genes, we analyzed the root transcriptomes of wild-type Col-0, mutant myb72, and complemented 35S:FLAG-MYB72/myb72 plants in response to ISR-inducing Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417.  â¢ Five WCS417-inducible genes were misregulated in myb72 and complemented in 35S:FLAG-MYB72/myb72. Amongst these, we uncovered Î²-glucosidase BGLU42 as a novel component of the ISR signaling pathway. Overexpression of BGLU42 resulted in constitutive disease resistance, whereas bglu42 was defective in ISR. Furthermore, we found 195 genes to be constitutively upregulated in MYB72-overexpressing roots in the absence of WCS417. Many of these encode enzymes involved in the production of iron-mobilizing phenolic metabolites under conditions of iron deficiency. We provide evidence that BGLU42 is required for their release into the rhizosphere.   â¢ Together, this work highlights a thus far unidentified link between the ability of beneficial rhizobacteria to stimulate systemic immunity and mechanisms induced by iron deficiency in host plants. Total 18 samples of RNA extracted from Arabidopsis roots: Three genotypes: 1) Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana accession Col-0, 2) mutant myb72-2 (Col-0 background), 3) Transgenic 35S:FLAG-MYB72 (oxMYB72) in the myb72-2 background; Two treatments: 1) non-treated control, 2) Roots colonized by beneficial Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417 rhizobacteria; Replicates: three biological replicates per genotype/treatment combination

Protocol Description	Data were normalized using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) expression measure in the Affypackage (Gautier et al., 2004). ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 GC-RMA signal normalized data	cRNA labeling, hybridization, washing and scanning of Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChips (Affymetrix) were performed according to Affymetrix OneCycle Lab protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).	cRNA labeling, hybridization, washing and scanning of Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChips (Affymetrix) were performed according to Affymetrix OneCycle Lab protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).	Treatment protocol as described in: Zamioudis, C., Hanson, J. and Pieterse, C.M.J. (2014). Ã-Glucosidase BGLU42 is a MYB72-dependent key regulator of rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance and modulates iron deficiency responses in Arabidopsis roots. New Phytologist 204: 368-379. Ten microliters of bacterial suspension were then applied on each root of 17-d-old seedlings, immediately below the hypocotyl.	Growth protocols as described in: Zamioudis, C., Hanson, J. and Pieterse, C.M.J. (2014). Ã-Glucosidase BGLU42 is a MYB72-dependent key regulator of rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance and modulates iron deficiency responses in Arabidopsis roots. New Phytologist 204: 368-379. Seeds of Col-0, myb72-2 and oxMYB72 were surface sterilized and sown on 1 X Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar-solidified medium supplemented with 1% sucrose (Murashige & Skoog, 1962). After 2 d of stratification at 4Â°C, the Petri dishes were positioned vertically and transferred toa growth chamber (22Â°C; 12 h : 12 h light : dark; light intensity, 100 Î¼mol/m2/s). Uniform 5-d-old seedlings were transferred to new plates containing agar-solidified Hoagland medium composed of KNO3 (5 mM), KH2PO4 (2 mM), Ca(NO3)2 (5 mM), MgSO4 (2 mM), KCl (50 Î¼M), H3BO3 (50 Î¼M), MnSO4 (10 Î¼M), ZnSO4 (2 Î¼M), CuSO4 (1.5 Î¼M), (NH4)6Mo7O24 (0.075 Î¼M) and MES (2.5 mM). The concentration of Fe(III)EDTA was adjusted to 50 Î¼M and the pH of the medium to 5.8. Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417 (now renamed into Pseudomonas simiae WCS417) was cultured at 28Â°C on Kingâs medium B (KB) agar plates supplemented with 50 Î¼g/ml of rifampicin. After 24 h of growth, cells were collected in 10 mM MgSO4, washed twice by centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 g and finally resuspended in 10mM MgSO4. For in vitro assays, the bacterial titer was adjusted to the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.01 (10-E7 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml).	Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturerâs instructions. RNA purity and integrity were confirmed using an RNA 6000 Nano Assay (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) and gel electrophoresis.	cRNA labeling, hybridization, washing and scanning of Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChips (Affymetrix) were performed according to Affymetrix OneCycle Lab protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
