In Arabidopsis thaliana, the root-specific transcription factor MYB72 is required for the onset of ISR, but is also associated with plant survival under conditions of iron deficiency. Here we investigated the role of MYB72 in both processes.  • To identify MYB72 target genes, we analyzed the root transcriptomes of wild-type Col-0, mutant myb72, and complemented 35S:FLAG-MYB72\/myb72 plants in response to ISR-inducing Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417.  • Five WCS417-inducible genes were misregulated in myb72 and complemented in 35S:FLAG-MYB72\/myb72. Amongst these, we uncovered β-glucosidase BGLU42 as a novel component of the ISR signaling pathway. Overexpression of BGLU42 resulted in constitutive disease resistance, whereas bglu42 was defective in ISR. Furthermore, we found 195 genes to be constitutively upregulated in MYB72-overexpressing roots in the absence of WCS417. Many of these encode enzymes involved in the production of iron-mobilizing phenolic metabolites under conditions of iron deficiency. We provide evidence that BGLU42 is required for their release into the rhizosphere.   • Together, this work highlights a thus far unidentified link between the ability of beneficial rhizobacteria to stimulate systemic immunity and mechanisms induced by iron deficiency in host plants. Total 18 samples of RNA extracted from Arabidopsis roots: Three genotypes: 1) Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana accession Col-0, 2) mutant myb72-2 (Col-0 background), 3) Transgenic 35S:FLAG-MYB72 (oxMYB72) in the myb72-2 background; Two treatments: 1) non-treated control, 2) Roots colonized by beneficial Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417 rhizobacteria; Replicates: three biological replicates per genotype\/treatment combination"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Corné M.J.
