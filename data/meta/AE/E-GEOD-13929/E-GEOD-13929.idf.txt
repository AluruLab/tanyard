Experiment Description	"This study focuses on responses of the host plant to infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Genome wide changes in gene expression were integrated with the alterations in metabolite levels three hours after inoculation of agrobacteria. Plants were infected with the virulent strain C58, harboring a T-DNA, or with strain GV3101, containing a disarmed Ti-plasmid. This allows discrimination between signals which derive from the bacterial pathogen and the T-DNA encoded genes. Experiment Overall Design: The bases of Arabidopsis thaliana (WS-2) inflorescence stalks were wounded and immediately infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens or mock-infected for three hours. Stalks of intact plants were inoculated with the oncogenic strain C58 (C58 3 hpi 1 to 6) or the non-virulent strain GV3101 (GV3101 3 hpi 1 to 3) to provide conditions close to nature. The gene expression data of three independent experiments of infected material were compared with six non-infected samples (reference 3 hpi 1 to 6). Differential gene expression was determined by applying the LIMMA package (Linear Models for Microarray Data; Smyth, G.K. (2004) Applic. Genet. Mol. Biol. 3, Article 3; http://www.bepress.com/sagmb/vol3/iss1/art3/)."

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana plants were cultivated in a growth chamber under short-day conditions (8 h of light, 120 µE) at 22°C and 16°C during the dark period (16 h).	Arabidopsis thaliana plants were cultivated in a growth chamber under short-day conditions (8 h of light, 120 µE) at 22°C and 16°C during the dark period (16 h). Agrobacteria were grown on YEB plates over night.

"The base of the first emerging main inflorescence stalk (3-5 cm) of intact plants was wounded with a syringe needle, mock-inoculated and grown for another three hours."	The base of the first emerging main inflorescence stalk (3-5 cm) of intact plants was wounded with a syringe needle and inoculated with A. tumefaciens strain GV3101. Agrobacteria were scratched from the surface of an agar plate with a bent pipette tip by preventing contamination with medium and evenly spread on the wounded inflorescence stalk area immediately after wounding. Inoculated plants were grown for another three hours.
