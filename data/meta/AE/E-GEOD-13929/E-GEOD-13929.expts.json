Genome wide changes in gene expression were integrated with the alterations in metabolite levels three hours after inoculation of agrobacteria. Plants were infected with the virulent strain C58, harboring a T-DNA, or with strain GV3101, containing a disarmed Ti-plasmid. This allows discrimination between signals which derive from the bacterial pathogen and the T-DNA encoded genes. Experiment Overall Design: The bases of Arabidopsis thaliana (WS-2) inflorescence stalks were wounded and immediately infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens or mock-infected for three hours. Stalks of intact plants were inoculated with the oncogenic strain C58 (C58 3 hpi 1 to 6) or the non-virulent strain GV3101 (GV3101 3 hpi 1 to 3) to provide conditions close to nature. The gene expression data of three independent experiments of infected material were compared with six non-infected samples (reference 3 hpi 1 to 6). Differential gene expression was determined by applying the LIMMA package (Linear Models for Microarray Data; Smyth, G.K. (2004) Applic. Genet. Mol.
