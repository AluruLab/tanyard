In the transfer experiments, 2 treatments were analysed for evaluating the short-(3, 6 and 12 h pooled) and medium-(1 and 2 d pooled) term effects of Pi deficiency on the gene expression. Since some Arabidopsis genes are regulated by diurnal rhythm and circadian clocks, plantlets were harvested separately at the beginning and at the end of the photoperiod and pooled. In the long term experiment, leaves and roots were sampled separately after 10 days. Triplicates were analysed for each experiment."}],"provider":[{"contact":"ajay jain","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"laurent nussaume","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"maryse block","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"richard bligny","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"luis herrerra-estrella","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"kashchandra raghothama","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"philippe ortet","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"julie misson","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Shauna somerville","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"juliette jouhet","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"marie-christine thibaud","role":"submitter","email":"mcthibaud@cea.fr"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20546591,"authors":"Paulose B, Kandasamy S, Dhankher OP.","title":"Expression profiling of Crambe abyssinica under arsenate stress identifies genes and gene networks involved in arsenic metabolism and detoxification.","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2229-10-108","issue":"None","pages":108,"year":2010},{"accession":16085708,"authors":"Julie Misson; Marie-Christine Thibaud; Laurent Nussaume; Kashchandra Raghothama; Ajay Jain; Juliette Jouhet; Maryse Block; Richard Bligny; Philippe Ortet; Luis Herrerra-Estrella; Shauna Somerville","title":"A genome wide transcriptional analysis using Arabidopsis thaliana Affymetrix gene chips determined plant responses  to phosphate deprivation","pages":"11934-11939","publication":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","volume":102,"year":2005,"uri":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/cgi\/reprint\/102\/33\/11934"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"Individual","value":["leaves L1","leaves L2","leaves L3","leaves L4","leaves L5","leaves L6","medium term transfer RAGU S3","medium term transfer RAGU S4","medium term transfer RAGU5","medium term transfer RAGU6","medium term transfer RAGU7","medium term transfer RAGU8","roots 1_-P","roots 2_+P","roots R1","roots R2","roots R5","roots R6","short term transfer RAGU S1","short term transfer RAGU S2","short term transfer RAGU1","short term transfer RAGU2","short term transfer RAGU3","short term transfer RAGU4"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["leaf","root","whole_organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"amount of phosphate in medium","value":["high phosphate (1mM)","low phosphate (0.005 mM)"]},{"name":"organism part","value":["leaf","root","whole_organism"]},{"name":"treatment time","value":["1 to 2 d","10 d","3 to 12 h"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":24,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":88907,"accession":"P-MEXP-12288"},{"id":88906,"accession":"P-MEXP-11749"},{"id":88910,"accession":"P-MEXP-12141"},{"id":88915,"accession":"P-MEXP-12140"},{"id":88908,"accession":"P-MEXP-11820"},{"id":88905,"accession":"P-MEXP-11782"},{"id":88909,"accession":"P-MEXP-12148"},{"id":88911,"accession":"P-MEXP-12145"},{"id":88912,"accession":"P-MEXP-12146"},{"id":143,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4"},{"id":88913,"accession":"P-MEXP-12143"},{"id":88904,"accession":"P-MEXP-12139"},{"id":88914,"accession":"P-MEXP-12144"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":24,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":24,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":24,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
