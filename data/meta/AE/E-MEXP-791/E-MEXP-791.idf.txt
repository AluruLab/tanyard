Experiment Description	The effects of phosphate starvation in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) plants were compared in plants grown in liquid MS medium transferred in low or high Pi and in plants grown vertically in petri dishes during 10 days. In the transfer experiments, 2 treatments were analysed for evaluating the short-(3, 6 and 12 h pooled) and medium-(1 and 2 d pooled) term effects of Pi deficiency on the gene expression. Since some Arabidopsis genes are regulated by diurnal rhythm and circadian clocks, plantlets were harvested separately at the beginning and at the end of the photoperiod and pooled. In the long term experiment, leaves and roots were sampled separately after 10 days. Triplicates were analysed for each experiment.

Protocol Description	Medium term transfer : plantlets were grown in MS medium, then after rinsing were transferred for 1 and 2 days (pooled) in a medium without phosphate.	Short term transfer : plantlets were grown in MS medium, then after rinsing were transferred for 3, 6 and 12h (pooled) in high phosphate (1mM).	Roots of long term experiment : plantlets were grown vertically during 10 days in solid MS medium, supplemented with low phosphate (0.005 mM). Roots were harvested separately.	Leaves of long term experiment : plantlets were grown vertically during 10 days in solid MS medium, supplemented with high phosphate (0.5 mM). Leaves were harvested separately.	Medium term transfer : plantlets were grown in MS medium, then after rinsing were transferred for 1 and 2 days (pooled) in high phosphate (1mM).	Short term transfer : plantlets were grown in MS medium, then after rinsing were transferred for 3, 6 and 12h (pooled) in a medium without phosphate.	Roots of long term experiment : plantlets were grown vertically during 10 days in solid MS medium, supplemented with high phosphate (0.5 mM). Roots were harvested separately.	Leaves of long term experiment : plantlets were grown vertically during 10 days in solid MS medium, supplemented with low phosphate (0.005 mM). Leaves were harvested separately.	Plant Material and Growth Conditions: Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) plants (col ecotype) were raised in liquid culture and transferred in a medium with or without Pi for evaluating the short-(3, 6 and 12 h pooled) and medium-(1 and 2 d pooled) term effects of Pi deficiency on the gene expression. 	Plant material and growth conditions: For studying long-term effects of Pi deficiency, surface-sterilized seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (WS ecotype) were sown in square (12 x12 cm) Petri dishes on MS/10 medium (with 0.5 % sucrose, 0.8 % agar) and supplemented with either 500 ?M (P+) or 5 ?M (P-) Pi and plants were grown vertically in a growth chamber (14h light / 10h dark, 22°/18°C, 150?mol.s-1.m-2). Since some Arabidopsis genes are regulated by diurnal rhythm and circadian clocks, the roots and the leaves were harvested separately at the beginning and at the end of the photoperiod and pooled. Samples were rinsed with distilled water, blot-dried and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 	RNA Extraction and cRNA Preparation: Total RNA from shoot and root (long-term) and from the whole plant (short- and medium-term) was isolated by hot phenol-chloroforme and lithium chloride precipitation. cRNA was prepared following the manufacturers instructions (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx).	Refer to the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual, chapter 3, "Synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA (IVT) and chapter 4, "Control of cRNA preparation".	Title: Fluidics Station Protocol.
