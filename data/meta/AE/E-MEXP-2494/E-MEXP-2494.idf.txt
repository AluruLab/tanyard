Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	grow	specified_biomaterial_action	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation			
Protocol Description	"3-day-old seedlings were ground into powder in liquid nitrogen, then total RNA was extracted by standard phenol/SDS method. <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"	"Seeds were sterilized by Ethanol:20% Bleach (commercial) =7:3 for 3 minutes with vigorous shaking then rinsed twice with Ethanol. After air drying, the seeds were plated on 0.5X MS 0.8% agar media. Following 3 days of stratification, plates were transferred to growth chamber and incubated under constant light for 4 days.<br>(Parameters: start time = 4, time unit = days, min temperature = 21, temperature unit = C, media = 0.5X MS agar media)"	"seedlings were grown blotting paper lied on 0.5xMS media for 3 days and transferred to either DMSO, GR24 or CTLVI containing media."
