We have investigated the subcellular interactions of rice stress-associated proteins (SAPs) using yeast two-hybrid and FRET approaches and found that A20 domain mediates the interaction of OsSAP1 with self, its close homolog OsSAP11, and a rice receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, OsRLCK253. Such interactions between OsSAP1\/11 and with OsRLCK253 occur at nuclear membrane, plasma membrane and in nucleus. Functionally, both OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253 could improve the water-deficit and salt stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants via a signaling pathway affecting the expression of several common endogenous genes. The yield in transgenic plants is also protected indicating the agronomic relevance of OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253 in conferring abiotic stress tolerance. Arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing rice genes OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253  were compared with untransformed plants at seedling level"}],"provider":[{"contact":"Akhilesh Kumar Tyagi","role":"submitter","email":"akhilesh@genomeindia.org"},{"contact":"Jitender Giri","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Akhilesh K Tyagi","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["3 week"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-1"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["OsRLCK253 transgenic","OsSAP11 transgenic","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["OsRLCK253 transgenic","OsSAP11 transgenic","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1127610,"accession":"P-GSE27861-2"},{"id":1127608,"accession":"P-GSE27861-3"},{"id":1127609,"accession":"P-GSE27861-4"},{"id":1127607,"accession":"P-GSE27861-5"},{"id":1127606,"accession":"P-GSE27861-6"},{"id":1127605,"accession":"P-GSE27861-7"},{"id":1127604,"accession":"P-GSE27861-8"},{"id":1127603,"accession":"P-GSE27861-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
