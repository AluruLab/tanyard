Investigation Title	Rice A20/AN1 zinc-finger containing stress-associated proteins (SAP1/11) and a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (OsRLCK253) interact via A20 zinc-finger and confer abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Rice A20/AN1 zinc-finger containing stress-associated proteins (SAP1/11) and a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (OsRLCK253) interact via A20 zinc-finger and confer abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants							
Experiment Description	"The inbuilt mechanisms of plant survival have been exploited for improving tolerance to abiotic stresses. We have investigated the subcellular interactions of rice stress-associated proteins (SAPs) using yeast two-hybrid and FRET approaches and found that A20 domain mediates the interaction of OsSAP1 with self, its close homolog OsSAP11, and a rice receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, OsRLCK253. Such interactions between OsSAP1/11 and with OsRLCK253 occur at nuclear membrane, plasma membrane and in nucleus. Functionally, both OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253 could improve the water-deficit and salt stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants via a signaling pathway affecting the expression of several common endogenous genes. The yield in transgenic plants is also protected indicating the agronomic relevance of OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253 in conferring abiotic stress tolerance. Arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing rice genes OsSAP11 and OsRLCK253  were compared with untransformed plants at seedling level"

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = GCRMA normalized signal values	"Following fragmentation, 15 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450"	Seedlings were raised on 1/2 MS medium without antibiotic selection for 21 days.	"First-order analysis was performed using Affymetrix Gene Chip Operating (GCOS) software 1.2.1. Normalization of data and differential expression analysis was done using Array Assist software (Strandgenomics, Bangalore, India)"	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix Gene Chip Scanner 3000	Untreated seedlings were used for tissue	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5ug total RNA
