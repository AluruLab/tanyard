Protocol Description	"Seeds of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (col-0) were surface-sterilised in 1 ml 70% ethanol for 10 minutes and then dried for 1 hour. Seeds were grown on full-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) Basal Medium with full-strength vitamin solution and 0.8% agar. Plates were sealed with microporous tape (SAFA Group, UK). Approximately 100 seeds were grown on each plate. After 48 - 72 hours stratification (in the dark at 4°C), plates were transferred to a AR36L3 A. thaliana growth cabinet (Percival, USA) with a 16- / 8-hour light / dark regime with a PFD of 130 mmol m-2 s-1 and day / night temperatures of 20 ± 2° C / 18 ± 2° C, for 10 days. Illumination was provided by 740 TL warm white lamps (Philips, UK) and 25 W incandescent lamps."	"Agar plates containing 10 day old seedlings were transferred to a fumigation chamber inside the growth cabinet. Seedlings were exposed to ozone at a flow rate of 910 ml / min. Ozone was generated by a Dasibi (Glendale, CA, US) 1008-PC ozone generator and was bubbled through water before entering the chambers. Fumigation was carried out for six hours beginning at 10.00 GMT."	Agar plates containing 10 day old seedlings were transferred to a fumigation chamber inside the growth cabinet. Seedlings were exposed to air passed through a charcoal / purafil filter to remove ambient ozone at a flow rate of 910 ml / min. Treatment was carried out for six hours beginning at 10.00 GMT.	"Seedlings were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.  RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, UK) as recommended by the manufacturer. On-column DNase digestion with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen, UK) was carried out. For the final elution, 30 microlitres RNase-free water was used. To increase the final RNA concentration, a second elution was performed using the first eluate. "	100 seedlings were pooled from each agar plate.	cRNA was labelled using the Affymetrix in vitro transcription Enzo Kit (Affymetrix GeneChip Technical Analysis Manual)	Title: Affymetrix EukGE-WS2v4 Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL Analysis (Percentile). Description: 	"Expression values were generated using dChip software from normalized .CEL file data, using the PM/MM difference model, and log base 2 transformed."
