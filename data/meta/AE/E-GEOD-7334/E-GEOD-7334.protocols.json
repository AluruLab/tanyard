Each 0.5 to 1 g of powdered tissue were added to 5 cm3 of STAT-60 (Tel-Test, TX). The mixture was homogenized and stored on ice for 10 min. Chloroform\/isoamyl (24:1, v:v) ETOH was added to the homogenate and centrifuged at 12000g for 30 min (40C). Following the transfer of the aqueous phase to a fresh tube, RNA was precipitated with isopropanol overnight at â€\"200C, pelleted by centrifugation at 12000g for 30 min (40C), and resuspended 0.1 cm3 of RNase-free water. Total RNA was quantified using Beckman Spectrophotometer, and qualified by running 1 μg cm-1 of each sample onto a RNA Lab-On-A-Chip using a Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent technologies, Mountain View, CA).","type":"nucleic_acid_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null}]}}
