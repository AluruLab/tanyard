GSE6696GSM154505	Arabidopsis thaliana	EFO	http://purl.org/obo/owl/NCBITaxon#NCBITaxon_3702	Columbia	50	days	hydrated pollen grains	Hydrated pollen grains:  In order to get enough hydrated pollen grains, the âthin liquid layerâ germination methods were developed.  First, the freshly anther-dehisced flowers were collected into 1.5 ml microfuge tubes filled with 800 ul of basic medium (the basic medium was composed of 1 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 1.5 mM boric acid, 15% (w/v) sucrose, 0.05% (w/v) lactalbumin hgdrolysate, 10 uM myo-inositol, 5 mM MES, and the pH was adjusted to 5.8 with Tris).  The microfuge tubes were strongly vortexed for 2 min to release the mature pollen grains into the medium.  The mixture was then transferred into new microfuge tubes and centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 1 min.  The pollen pellet was resuspended with 30 ul of the basic medium and subsequently cultured in the Petri dishes.  It was noticed that making a well-spreaded thin layer of pollen grains is a key point to get high rates (70%-75%) of pollen germination.  In order to well spread the tiny drop of pollen grains on the Petri dish (35 mm diameter) surface, a steel-wire net (D=80 um) was placed to form a thin liquid layer.  Then, the covered Petri dishes were transferred to a chamber and incubated at 25â for 45 min and the hydrated pollen grains were collected for total RNA extraction..
