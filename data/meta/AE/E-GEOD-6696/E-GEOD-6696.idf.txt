Experiment Description	Pollen germination, along with pollen tube growth, is an essential process for the reproduction of flowering plants.  The germinating pollen with tip-growth characteristics provides an ideal model system for the study of cell growth and morphogenesis.  As an essential step towards a detailed understanding of this important process, the objective of this study was to comprehensively analyze the transcriptome changes during pollen germination and pollen tube growth.  Using Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays, this study is the first to show the changes in the transcriptome from desiccated mature pollen grains to hydrated pollen grains and then to pollen tubes of Arabidopsis thaliana.  The number of expressed genes, either for total expressed genes or for specifically expressed genes, increased significantly from desiccated mature pollen to hydrated pollen and again to growing pollen tubes, which is consistent with the finding that pollen germination and tube growth was significantly inhibited in vitro by a transcriptional inhibitor.  The results of GO analyses showed that expression of genes related to cell rescue, transcription, signal transduction and cellular transport were significantly changed, especially for up-regulation, during pollen germination and tube growth, respectively.  In particular, genes of the CaM/CML, CHX and Hsp families showed the most significant changes during pollen germination and tube growth.  These results demonstrate that the overall transcription of genes, both in the number of expressed genes and in the levels of transcription, was increased.  Furthermore, the appearance of many novel transcripts during pollen germination as well as tube growth indicates that these newly expressed genes may function in this complex process.

Transcriptome analyses show changes in gene expression to accompany pollen germination and tube growth in Arabidopsis. Plant Physiol. September 5, 2008; 10.1104/pp.108.126375 Experiment Overall Design: Three samples are analyzed in this experiment.  They are desiccated mature pollen grains (MP), hydrated pollen grains (HP) and growing pollen tubes (PT) of Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively.  Each sample has two biological replicates, so that there are 6 data sets of ATH1 array in this experiment.

Protocol Description	Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) plants were grown in mixed soil in a growth chamber.  The light intensity was 120-150 umol m-2 s-1 for a 16 h daily light period and day/night temperatures were 22âÂ±2â and 18âÂ±2â, respectively.  Plants were watered once every 5 days with tap water and the relative humidity in the growth chamber was kept near 70%.	The total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).  RNA concentration, purity and integrity were determined and confirmed by using an Eppendorf Biophotometer (Eppendorf) and electrophoresis.  The total RNA was further purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).	Eight ug of purified total RNA was used to generate first-strand cDNA in a reverse transcription reaction (One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents, Affymetrix).  After second-strand synthesis, the double-stranded cDNA were used to generate cRNA via in vitro transcriptional reaction.  The cRNA was labeled with biotin and 20 ug of this cRNA was fragmented.  Size distribution of the cRNA and fragmented cRNA was assessed using an Eppendorf Biophotometer (Eppendorf) and electrophoresis.	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
