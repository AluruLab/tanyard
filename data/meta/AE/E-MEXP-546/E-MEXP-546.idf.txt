Protocol Description	Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 expressing avrRpm1 or avrRps4 was infiltrated at 10 E7 cfu/ml into leaves. Mock infiltration experiments were performed using 10 mM MgCl2 solution.	"Plants were soil grown in controlled environment chambers under a regime of 10 h light period at 150-200 uEinsteins m-2 sec-1, 23  C and 65 % relative humidity. Four-week-old plants were used for microarray experiments."	"Total RNA extracted using RNAwiz reagent (Ambion). cRNA was prepared following the manufacturer's instructions (www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx).Labelled cRNA transcripts were purified using the Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix). Fragmentation of cRNA transcripts, hybridization and scanning of the high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array, Affymetrix) were performed according to the manufacturer's GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual."
