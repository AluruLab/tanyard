To analyze the function of a rice GST gene, OsGSTU4, we overexpressed it into Arabidopsis constitutively. The physiological analyses revealed that overexpression of GRX gene enhanced abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants as compared to wild-type. We used microarrays to study the global effect of overexpression of OsGSTU4 in Arabidopsis. Wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on MS medium for 14-days in a culture room with a daily photoperiodic cycle of 16h light and 8h dark. The 500 ng of total RNA sample isolated from each tissue sample was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix protocol. Two biological replicates for wild-type and GRX overexpression line were used for microarray analysis."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Mukesh Jain","role":"submitter","email":"mjain@nipgr.ac.in"},{"contact":"Jain Mukesh","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Sharma Raghvendra","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["GST-overexpression","Wild-type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["Seedlings"]},{"category":"Stage","value":["14-day-old"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"GENOTYPE","value":["GST-overexpression","Wild-type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":4,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1066986,"accession":"P-GSE53152-3"},{"id":1066984,"accession":"P-GSE53152-2"},{"id":1066980,"accession":"P-GSE53152-1"},{"id":1066981,"accession":"P-GSE53152-7"},{"id":1066982,"accession":"P-GSE53152-6"},{"id":1066983,"accession":"P-GSE53152-5"},{"id":1066985,"accession":"P-GSE53152-4"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":4,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":4,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":4,"isderived":0}]}]}}
