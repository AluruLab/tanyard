Comment[Submitted Name]	Differentiating Arabidopsis shoots from leaves by combined YABBY activities							
Experiment Description	In seed plants, leaves are born on radial shoots but unlike shoots they are determinate dorsiventral organs made of flat lamina. YABBY genes are found only in seed plants and in all cases studied, are expressed primarily in lateral organs and in a polar manner. Despite their simple expression, Arabidopsis plants lacking all YABBY gene activities have a wide range of morphological defects in all lateral organs as well as the shoot apical meristem. Here we show that leaves lacking all YABBY activities are initiated as dorsiventral appendages but fail to properly activate lamina programs. In particular, the activation of most CIN-TCPs does not commence, SAM-specific programs are reactivated, and a marginal leaf domain is not established. Altered distribution of auxin signalling and the auxin efflux carrier PIN1, highly reduced venation, initiation of multiple cotyledons, and gradual loss of the SAM accompany these defects. We suggest that YABBY functions were recruited to mould modified shoot systems into flat plant appendages by translating organ polarity into lamina specific programs that include marginal auxin flow and activation a maturation schedule directing determinate growth. Four repeats of wild type 14 DAS plants were used to compare to fil,y3 and fil,y3,y5 mutants of similar age (two repeats of each)

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = log2 GC-RMA signal	Arrays were scanned using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G using standard affymetrix protocol.	Standard affymetrix protocol	Total RNA (10-7 Î¼g) was extracted with the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen)	Plants were grown for 14 days under short days conditions	Standard affymetrix protocol	Signal values were obtained and normalized with the GC-RMA protocol using R 2.7.2 and Bioconductor 2.2. Genes with expression value lower than log2(10) were removed.
