Investigation Title	Expression data from 10 day old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings					
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from 10 day old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings					
Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Transcription profiling by array of Arabidopsis RNAi knock-down plants of SPT4-1 and SPT4-2					
Experiment Description	Microarrays were used to detail the global programme of gene expression comparing wild-type and RNAi knock-down plants of SPT4-1 and SPT4-2 Arabidosis seeds were stratified for 2 days and grown for 10 days on solid (0.8% Agar) MS in an plant incubator in a 16 hours day, 8 hours night rythm.  Only the aerial part was harvested 2h after turning on the light.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with Affimetrix Expression Console Software using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. ID_REF =  VALUE = RMA signal intensity	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, cRNA was hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	seeds were stratified for 2 days and grown for 10 days on solid (0.8% Agar) MS in an plant incubator only the aerial part was harvested	RNeasy Mini Plant kit supplied with RNase-Free DNase set (Qiagen)	GeneChips were scanned using the Affimetrix Genechip Scanner 3000
