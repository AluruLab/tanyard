Experiment Description	The goal of this experiment was to identify the early target genes of constitutively activated CPK5ac and CPK11ac in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells that are involved in early flagellin responses important for plant innate immunity. We used the microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying initial calcium responses to microbial associated molecualr patterns (MAMPs). Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were transfected with plasmid DNA to express constitutively active CPK5ac or CPK11ac for 6 hr.  Transcript profiles were analyzed and compared between cells transfected with control DNA and CPK5ac or CPK11ac DNA to identify early CPK5ac and CPK11ac target genes.

Protocol Description	Protoplasts (0.8 - 2 million) were transfected with 1 mg DNA/ml protoplasts using PEG-calcium and incubated in 10 ml 0.5 M mannitol, 4 mM MES pH 5.7 and 20 mM KCl for 6 hr at 25oC.	Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were grown in a controlled room for 28 days at 22oC, 60% relative humidity, 75 uE light and 12 hr photoperiod.	Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerâs protocol	Total RNA (10 Âµg) were amplified, biotinylated and fragmented using the BioArrayTM HighYieldTM RNA transcript labelling kit (Enzo) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized on the Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChips using the Affymetrix 640 Hybridization Oven. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	GeneChips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 7G with AutoLoader.	The data were analyzed in FlexArray with RMA including background correction and normalization.	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA log(2) signal intensity
