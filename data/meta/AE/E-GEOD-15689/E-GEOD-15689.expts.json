Photoperiod and temperature are among the most important environmental variables. Suboptimal, but not near-freezing, temperatures regulate flowering through the thermosensory pathway, which overlaps with the autonomous pathway. Here we show that ambient temperature regulates flowering by two genetically distinguishable pathways, one that requires TFL1 and another that requires ELF3. The delay in flowering time observed at lower temperatures was partially suppressed in single elf3 and tfl1 mutants, whereas double elf3 tfl1 mutants were insensitive to temperature. tfl1 mutations abolished the temperature response in cryptochrome mutants that are deficient in photoperiod perception, but not in phyB mutants that have a constitutive photoperiodic response. Contrary to tfl1, elf3 mutations were able to suppress the temperature response in phyB mutants, but not in cryptochrome mutants. The gene expression profile revealed that the tfl1 and elf3 effects are due to the activation of different sets of genes and identified CCA1 and SOC1\/AGL20 as being important cross talk points. Finally, genome-wide gene expression analysis strongly suggests a general and complementary role for ELF3 and TFL1 in temperature signalling. Three genotypes, WT (Columbia), elf3-7 and tfl1-1 mutants. Three biological replicates for each condition (genotype X temperature combination). RNA prepared independently for each sample."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Bárbara Strasser","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Andrea Califano","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Mariano J Alvarez","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Pablo D Cerdan","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Pablo Diego Cerdan","role":"submitter","email":"geo@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":19187043,"authors":"Strasser B, Alvarez MJ, Califano A, Cerdán PD","title":"A complementary role for ELF3 and TFL1 in the regulation of flowering time by ambient temperature.","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["10 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["elf3-7","tfl1-1","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["elf3-7","tfl1-1","wild type"]},{"name":"temperature","value":["16 degree celsius","23 degree celsius"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":18,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1125138,"accession":"P-GSE15689-11"},{"id":1125139,"accession":"P-GSE15689-10"},{"id":1125133,"accession":"P-GSE15689-15"},{"id":1125134,"accession":"P-GSE15689-14"},{"id":1125136,"accession":"P-GSE15689-13"},{"id":1125137,"accession":"P-GSE15689-12"},{"id":1125152,"accession":"P-GSE15689-19"},{"id":1125151,"accession":"P-GSE15689-18"},{"id":1125129,"accession":"P-GSE15689-17"},{"id":1125131,"accession":"P-GSE15689-16"},{"id":1125143,"accession":"P-GSE15689-6"},{"id":1125144,"accession":"P-GSE15689-5"},{"id":1125141,"accession":"P-GSE15689-8"},{"id":1125142,"accession":"P-GSE15689-7"},{"id":1125140,"accession":"P-GSE15689-9"},{"id":1125145,"accession":"P-GSE15689-3"},{"id":1125135,"accession":"P-GSE15689-4"},{"id":1125147,"accession":"P-GSE15689-1"},{"id":1125146,"accession":"P-GSE15689-2"},{"id":1125156,"accession":"P-GSE15689-27"},{"id":1125153,"accession":"P-GSE15689-28"},{"id":1125132,"accession":"P-GSE15689-25"},{"id":1125130,"accession":"P-GSE15689-26"},{"id":1125149,"accession":"P-GSE15689-23"},{"id":1125148,"accession":"P-GSE15689-24"},{"id":1125155,"accession":"P-GSE15689-21"},{"id":1125150,"accession":"P-GSE15689-22"},{"id":1125154,"accession":"P-GSE15689-20"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":18,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":18,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":18,"isderived":0}]}]}}
