We used microarrays to compare the global transcriptional changes between the WT and cmt3 after the irradiation of 200 Gy. Transcriptions of transposition-related genes seemed to be differently affected in the WT and cmt3 by gamma rays, depending on the epigenetic codes of the genome. However, genome-wide transcriptions of the WT and cmt3 couldn't be positively correlated with the different levels of DNA methylation after the irradiation of 200 Gy. Rosette leaves from more than 10 plants were pooled for total RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 genechips. We performed two independent array experiments using totally different biological replicates of WT and cmt3 mutant plants with or without gamma irradiation."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Jin-Hong Kim","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Jin-Hong Kim","role":"submitter","email":"jhongkim@kaeri.re.kr"},{"contact":"JiEun Kim","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["29d after seeds were sown","33d after seeds were sown"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["rosette leaf only"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE","value":["29d after seeds were sown","33d after seeds were sown"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":16,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":780483,"accession":"P-GSE43947-1"},{"id":780489,"accession":"P-GSE43947-2"},{"id":780484,"accession":"P-GSE43947-7"},{"id":780488,"accession":"P-GSE43947-3"},{"id":780487,"accession":"P-GSE43947-4"},{"id":780486,"accession":"P-GSE43947-5"},{"id":780485,"accession":"P-GSE43947-6"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":16,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":16,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":16,"isderived":0}]}]}}
