Protocol Description	"Plants of the wild-type Col and the atx1 mutant(Nottingham Seed Stock Center (NASC) code is ?). The shoot apex of plants (comprising shoot apex meristem, first and second leaf primordia at petiole-less stage) were harvested at the growth stage 1.0 removing the cotyledons and the hypocotyls and at least 4 hours after the beginning of the photoperiod when photosynthetic and metabolic activities of plants are stable (Boyes et al., 2001).  "	"The growth chamber conditions were: 16/8 hrs (d/n) with white light (Neon tubes, cool white), 100 ÂµEm-Â²h-1 PAR and 20 Â°C.  60 seeds were sowed in per 150 x 25 mm round dish, sealed with Urgopore tape and placed in darkness at 4oC for 3 days."	"Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini-kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany)"	"The experimental design comprised 3 replicates of each genotype, one replicate corresponding to one RNA extraction on a independent pool of about 150 plant apex. "	"Affymetrix  Labelling protocol for ARE-ATH1 array  The labelling protocol is applicable for use with the GeneChip ARE-ATH1 when starting with a minimal amount of 5ug total RNA.  The protocol is derived from the ÂGeneChipÂ® Expression Analysis Technical ManualÂ (Section 2 Eukaryotic sample and array processing). The document can be found at the affymetrix website: http://www.affymetrix.com/support/downloads/manuals/expression_s2_manual.pdf   Within this document (expression_s2_manual.pdf), the following sections are applicable for the labelling protocol:  2.1.3 Eukaryotic Target Preparation 2.1.7 - 2.1.8 Reagents and Materials Required 2.1.13 - 2.1.18 One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis  2.1.32 - 2.1.33 Cleanup of Double Stranded cDNA for Both the One-Cycle and Two-Cycle Target Labelling Assays 2.1.34 - 2.1.35 Synthesis of Biotin-Labelled cRNA for both the One-Cycle and Two-Cycle Target Labelling Assays. 2.1.36 2.1.38Â Cleanup and Quantification of Biotin-Labelled cRNA 2.1.39 Â 2.1.40 Fragmenting the cRNA for Target Preparation "	Title: Affymetrix EukGE-WS2v5 Hybridization.
