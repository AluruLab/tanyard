Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = RMA normalized signal intensity	standard Affymetrix protocol	standard Affymetrix protocol using Affymetrix Model 640 hybridization oven	standard Arabidopsis growth conditions in a Percival growth chamber - 16L/8D, 21 degrees day, 18 degrees night	Arabidopsis accessions were grown in 6x6x5-cm plastic pots filled with ~150 ml Profileâ„¢ porous ceramic rooting media. Plants were thinned to one per pot and were grown and treatments applied in a controlled environment chamber with 10-h photoperiod of 330 µmol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density. Daytime/nighttime temperatures were 23/18 C with 60% relative humidity. During growth all plants were fertilized with a complete, modified Hoagland's nutrient solution every two days and watered daily.	Microarray Suite 5, data processed with JMP Genomics, R statistics RMA background correction, log2 transformation, quantile normalized individual probe data are provided in the supplementary file on the Series record. Analysis of individual probe-level data was performed in order to remove probes from the array that hybridized differently between accessions for related gene expression analysis.

A major goal of the slow drydown treatment was to allow the intact, growing plants to acclimate to the imposed soil moisture stress. WatRem% was calculated as 100*(WTpot&soil-DWpot&soil)/( FCpot&soil- DWpot&soil). Wet (control) pots were treated identically, except WatRem% was maintained near 90% for the entire drydown period.	no treatment	Qiagen Dneasy Plant Mini prep	Qiagen RNAasy Plant Mini prep, samples initially harvested in RNAlater	Biotin labeling, Invitrogen Bioprime kit, following Borevitz 2005	biotin-labeled targets (cRNA) using a MessageAmpâ„¢ II-based protocol
