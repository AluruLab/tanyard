A major goal of the slow drydown treatment was to allow the intact, growing plants to acclimate to the imposed soil moisture stress. WatRem% was calculated as 100*(WTpot&soil-DWpot&soil)\/( FCpot&soil- DWpot&soil). Wet (control) pots were treated identically, except WatRem% was maintained near 90% for the entire drydown period.","type":"specified_biomaterial_action","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null},{"id":575930,"accession":"P-GSE27552-3","name":"P-GSE27552-3","text":"Arabidopsis accessions were grown in 6x6x5-cm plastic pots filled with ~150 ml Profile™ porous ceramic rooting media.
