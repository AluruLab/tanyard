Experiment Description	NFYA5 is a transcription factor important for drought resistance.  Drought stress up-regulates NFYA5 gene expression not only at the transcriptional level but also at the posttranscriptional level by down-regulating the expression of miR169a that targets NFYA5 transcript for cleavage. Experiment Overall Design: 2 replicates for WT (Col-0) were compared to 2 replicates for nfya5 (mutant)
