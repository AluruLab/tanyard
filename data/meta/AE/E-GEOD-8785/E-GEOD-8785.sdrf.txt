Two transgenic lines were used: one induces the expression of a dominant, gibberellin non-responsive DELLA protein (rga-delta17); the other is a control line that carries the same vector, but lacks the rga-delta17 transgene. A time course study on the accumulation the inducible DELLA protein as well as quantitative PCR for transcripts of early gibberellin responsive genes indicated that 2h and 4h were optimal to look at DELLA-regulated genes that are also responsive to gibberellins.
