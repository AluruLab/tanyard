Protocol Description	Whole seedlings were sprayed with 2 uM GA4 with a fine mister and shoots were collected 1h after treatment by cutting with a razor blade.	Whole seedlings were sprayed with water with a fine mister and shoots were collected 1h after treatment by cutting with a razor blade.	Whole seedlings were sprayed with 2 uM GA4 with a fine mister, 16 h prior to the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the seedlings were resprayed with 2 uM GA4 plus 10 uM DEX and shoots were collected 4h after treatment by cutting with a razor blade.	Whole seedlings were sprayed with 2 uM GA4 with a fine mister, 16 h prior to the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the seedlings were resprayed with 2 uM GA4 and shoots were collected 4h after treatment by cutting with a razor blade.	Whole seedlings were sprayed with 2 uM GA4 with a fine mister, 16 h prior to the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the seedlings were resprayed with 2 uM GA4 and shoots were collected 2h after treatment by cutting with a razor blade.	Whole seedlings were sprayed with 2 uM GA4 with a fine mister, 16 h prior to the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the seedlings were resprayed with 2 uM GA4 plus 10 uM DEX and shoots were collected 2h after treatment by cutting with a razor blade.	Seeds were germinated on MS agar plates supplemented with 2% sucrose on a piece of nylon mesh as support. Seedlings were grown vertically for 8 days under continuous light at 22C.	Seeds were germinated on MS agar plates supplemented with 2% sucrose on a piece of nylon mesh as support. Seedlings were grown vertically for 8 days under continuous light at 22C. On day 7, seedlings were pretreated with 2 micromolar GA4 in maximize gibberellin responses. On day 8, seedlings were sprayed with either 2 uM GA4 (mock) or a combination of 2 uM GA and 10 uM DEX. Tissue was collected after 2h and 4h.
