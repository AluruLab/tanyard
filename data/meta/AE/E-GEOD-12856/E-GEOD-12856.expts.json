To better understand the transcriptional changes in Arabidopsis towards Bgh, we compared un-inoculated and inoculated wild-type Arabidopsis samples, with those an ATAF1 mutant allele, compromised in penetration resistance. The experiment included sampling of 8 rosettes for each replicate sample from 6-weeks old plants, 12 hrs after inoculation. A total of 12 biolocigal replicates were sampled with three replicates from each of the four blocks (Wild-type, ataf1-1, Bgh, control).   ****[PLEXdb(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.plexdb.org\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.plexdb.org<\/a>) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor,  Michael Krogh Jensen.
