Experiment Description	Pro35SLBD16:GR or Pro35SLBD18:GR transgenic seedlings that overexpress LBD16 or LBD18 fused to glucocorticoidsteroid hormone binding domain(GR) under CaMV35S promoter were grown for 12 days under long-day conditions (16h light/ 8h dark).

Protocol Description	Pro35SLBD16:GR or Pro35SLBD18:GR transgenic seedlings that overexpress LBD16 or LBD18 fused to glucocorticoidsteroid hormone binding domain(GR) under CaMV35S promoter were grown for 12 days under long-day conditions (16h light/ 8h dark) on the Â½ Murashige Skoog(MS) medium containing vitamins, 1.5% sucrose, 2.5 mM Mes, pH 5.7, and 0.8% agar, treated with 10 uM dexamethasone (DEX) or mock-treated for 2.5 h. 	Pro35SLBD16:GR or Pro35SLBD18:GR transgenic seedlings that overexpress LBD16 or LBD18 fused to glucocorticoidsteroid hormone binding domain(GR) under CaMV35S promoter were grown for 12 days under long-day conditions (16h light/ 8h dark) on the Murashige Skoog(MS) medium containing vitamins, 1.5% sucrose, 2.5 mM Mes, pH 5.7, and 0.8% agar, treated with 10 uM dexamethasone (DEX) or mock-treated for 2.5 h. 	Each RNA sample is obtained from seedlings of Arabidopsis. The frozen plant tissue (~100 mg) was ground in tiny mortars dipped in liquid nitrogen. The frozen powder was carefully transfered into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes using small funnels and rubber spatulas also cooled with liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions and purified with an RNeasy minelute cleanup (Qiagen).	Equal amounts of RNA from triplicate samples were pooled.	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 		Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
