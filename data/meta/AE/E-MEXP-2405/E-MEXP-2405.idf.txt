Experiment Description	"nudt7-1 mutant plant exhibit stunted growth, enhanced basal resistance, elevated SA levels and spontaneous leaf cell death that is restricted to single cells but does not spread. All of these phenotypes depend on EDS1, a key regulator of plant innate immunity. Moreover, SA depletion in nudt7-1 results in EDS1-dependent cell death exacerbation and strong growth retardation. In this this experiment, we used 4-week-old soil-grown plants to seek for EDS1- and SA-regulated genes in nudt7-1 to identify novel components of the EDS1- and SA-signalling pathways."

Protocol Description	"Total RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturers recommendations. Extracted RNA was sent to Integrated Functional Genomic service unit (University of Muenster, Germany) for further processing.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)"	"Plants were grown for 28 days in controlled environment chambers (10h light period at 150-200ÂµE m-2 s-1, 22 C. 65% humidity) on soil. For each replicate, leaf material was harvested at the same time of day.<br>(Parameters: start time = 28, time unit = days, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C, media = Soil)"	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
