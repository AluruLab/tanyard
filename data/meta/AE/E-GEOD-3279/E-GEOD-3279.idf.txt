Experiment Description	To find downstream target of SOC1, we attemted global expression profiles in gain-of-function mutants of SOC1; To find downstream target of SOC1, we attemted global expression profiles in soc1-101D: ; Expt. 1 GSM73643, GSM73646; Expt. 2 GSM73647, GSM73648; Expt. 3 GSM73649, GSM73650; To find downstream target of SOC1, we attemted global expression profiles in soc1-2: GSM73649, GSM73651; To find downstream target of SOC1, we attemted global expression profiles in gain-of-function mutants of SOC1: ; GSM73643, GSM73646, GSM73647, GSM73648, GSM73649, GSM73650 Experiment Overall Design: To more completely identify the downstream targets of SOC1, we attemted to compare the expression profiles of g-o-f mutant of SOC1 with the results of soc1-2 mutant
