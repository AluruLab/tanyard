The transcriptomic response to the presence or absence of an inferior competitor (Hieracium pilosella) is therefore examined in roots of A. thaliana. The experiment was set up in pots filled with non-sterile sand, that allowed to sample roots of eight week old Arabidopsis plants. 3 biological replicates per treatment were examined. Each of these replicates represents 3 pooled  samples from individual plants."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Maik Bartelheimer","role":"submitter","email":"maik.bartelheimer@biologie.uni-regensburg.de"}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23967000,"authors":"Schmid C, Bauer S, Muller B, Bartelheimer M","title":"Belowground neighbor perception in Arabidopsis thaliana studied by transcriptome analysis: roots of Hieracium pilosella cause biotic stress","doi":"10.3389\/fpls.2013.00296","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["50 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root"]},{"category":"provider","value":["University of Regensburg"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"stimulus","value":["exposed to roots of Hieracium pilosella","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1169349,"accession":"P-MTAB-31882"},{"id":1169347,"accession":"P-MTAB-31884"},{"id":1169348,"accession":"P-MTAB-31883"},{"id":1169346,"accession":"P-MTAB-31885"},{"id":1169345,"accession":"P-MTAB-31886"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
