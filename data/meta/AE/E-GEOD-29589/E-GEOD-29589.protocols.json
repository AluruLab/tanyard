All further processing of the data was performed within the Bioconductor project and the R program software (R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License). The limma package implemented within Bioconductor was used to perform the linear modeling and the empirical Bayes statistics for differential expression analysis. The fold changes and standard errors were estimated by fitting a linear model for each gene and empirical Bayes smoothing was applied to the standard errors. Results are presented between two experimental conditions as a log2-fold change in expression level, the p-value, and the adjusted p-value. The adjusted p-value is the p-value adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochbergâ€™s method to control the false discovery rate. The meaning of the BH q-values is as follows. If all genes with q-value below a threshold of 0.05 are selected as differentially expressed, then the expected proportion of false discoveries in the selected group is controlled to be less than the threshold value of 5%. Transcripts with pvalue less than 0.05 and greater than 1.4 fold change were called as significantly differentially expressed genes."],"type":"feature_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null}]}}
