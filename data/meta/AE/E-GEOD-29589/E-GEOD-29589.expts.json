Unlike ammonium, nitrate must be reduced (with NADH and ferredoxin as electron donors) prior to assimilation. Thus, nitrate nutrition imposes a substantially greater energetic cost than ammonium nutrition. Our goal was to compare the transcriptomes of nitrate-supplied and ammonium-supplied plants, with a particular interest in characterizing the differences in redox metabolism elicited by different forms of inorganic nitrogen. We used microarrays to compare the short-term transcriptional response to either nitrogen supply or ammonium supply in Arabidopsis roots. Genes upregulated or downregulated by nitrate only, ammonium only, or both ammonium and nitrate were identified and analyzed. Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) plants were grown hydroponically until they reached growth stage 5.10. They were then transferred to a nitrogen-free medium for 26 hr and then supplied with 1 mM nitrate or 1 mM ammonium. RNA isolation (and subsequent microarray analysis) was performed on root tissue isolated just before nitrogen supply (time 0) and at 1.5 hr and 8 hr after nitrogen supply (1.5 hr nitrate, 8 hr nitrate, 1.5 hr ammonium, 8 hr ammonium)."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Matthew Escobar","role":"submitter","email":"mescobar@csusm.edu"},{"contact":"Matthew A Escobar","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Kurt Patterson","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":20444219,"authors":"Patterson K, Cakmak T, Cooper A, Lager I, Rasmusson AG, Escobar MA.","title":"Distinct signalling pathways and transcriptome response signatures differentiate ammonium- and nitrate-supplied plants","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["Boyes key 5.10"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["root"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["1 millimolar ammonium","1 millimolar nitrate","control"]},{"name":"time","value":["0 hour","1.5 hour","8 hour"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":15,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1127479,"accession":"P-GSE29589-7"},{"id":1127480,"accession":"P-GSE29589-8"},{"id":1127482,"accession":"P-GSE29589-5"},{"id":1127481,"accession":"P-GSE29589-6"},{"id":1127485,"accession":"P-GSE29589-3"},{"id":1127483,"accession":"P-GSE29589-4"},{"id":1127478,"accession":"P-GSE29589-1"},{"id":1127484,"accession":"P-GSE29589-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":15,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":15,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":15,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":15,"isderived":0}]}]}}
