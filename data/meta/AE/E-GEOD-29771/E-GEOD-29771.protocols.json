The raw MAS 5.0 data files obtained from scanned array images are then imported into GeneSpring 7.3.1 (Silicon Genetics). Only genes with Present (P) calls were included in the analysis. Raw signals of each gene were normalized with the median of all measurements on the chip. The average normalized value of the signal intensity for each gene in three replicate hybridization experiments was adopted as the expression value of the gene. The normalized values were used to identify the differentially regulated genes by calculating the log2 ratios, where the normalized mean intensity values of sdg8 were divided by respective values from ProβCG:GUS. Fold changes of differentially regulated genes in sdg8 compared with ProβCG:GUS were calculated from these ratios.For multiple comparisons among slides, a false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) was applied to generate adjusted p-values in GeneSpring 7.3.1 Using a FDR at 5% (p-value=0.05), we selected only the statistically significant genes that were regarded as differentially regulated only if their fold-change was ≥ 2.0 for up- and ≤ -2.0 fold for downregulated.","type":"feature_extraction","performer":null,"hardware":null,"software":null,"standardpublicprotocol":null}]}}
