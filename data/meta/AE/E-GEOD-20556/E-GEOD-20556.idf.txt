Publication Title	Karrikins enhance light responses during germination and seedling development in Arabidopsis thaliana

Experiment Description	Karrikins promote seed germination in Arabidopsis thaliana. Completion of germination (protrusion of the radicle) is not observed until ~72 h in dormant wildtype seed under these conditions. We used microarrays to examine karrikin-induced transcriptional changes after 24 h of imbibition. Transcriptional changes may indicate events leading to karrikin-induced germination or karrikin-specific markers. Primary dormant seed of wildtype (which can germinate and is promoted by KAR1) and ga1-3 (which cannot germinate, and is not promoted by KAR1) were imbibed on water-agar or 1 uM KAR1 in the light at 20 C and assayed for gene expression after 24 h. Three or four biological replicates per genotype/treatment.

Protocol Description	Total RNA was extracted from seed using Ambion RNAqueous kit with Plant RNA Isolation Aid. Before column purification, solubilized seed mixture was extracted with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to further remove polysaccharide and phenolic contaminants. RNA quality was confirmed using Agilent BioAnalyzer RNA 6000 Nano chips.	Primary dormant seed was collected from plants grown in continuous light (100 uE) and stored at -80C to preserve dormancy. Distinct seed batches were harvested and assayed.	Seed was imbibed 24 h on 0.8% water-agar with or without 1 uM KAR1 at 20C under 100 uE white light.	Biotinylated cRNA was prepared using Affymetrix Gene Expression 3' Amplification one cycle target labeling kit with 7 ug total RNA using manufacturer's protocol.	Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 with GeneChip Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner and Affymetrix GCOS software.	The data were analyzed with Avadis software using standard GC-RMA normalization.
