Experiment Description	Global gene expression was compared between root RNA samples from three-week-old Arabidopsis Col-0 plants subjected to 0.1% oxygen (balance nitrogen) or ambient atmospheric conditions. Three-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings (4-6 leaves) of ecotype Col-0 were used. Two biological replicates were used for each treatment, and for each biological replicate, five Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the same petri dish were bulked. RNA was extracted from root tissue excised post-treatment. Treatment consisted of moving plants grown on solid MS media containing 3% sucrose to liquid MS media containing 3% sucrose for 24 hours, after which plates were placed in anaerobic cannisters covered in aluminum foil. Cannisters containing plants in the 0.1% oxygen treatment group were flushed with a 0.1% oxygen gas mixture and then sealed, while cannisters in the control group were left unsealed. Treatment lasted 5 hours before plant tissue was harvested and RNA extracted.

Protocol Description	Plants were kept in a growth room at 22Â°C with a day:night period of 16:8-hrs and fluorescent lighting levels of ~75uE. Plants were grown on MS media with 3% sucrose and 0.8% agar and transferred to liquid MS media containing 3% sucrose one day prior to sampling.	Plants in the low oxygen treatment group were placed in anaerobic microbial chambers (Oxoid, Adelaide, SA, Australia) and the chambers were flushed with a gas mixture of 0.1% oxygen, balance nitrogen at a flow rate of ~10L/min. for 20 minutes. Chambers were then sealed, and plants were left in the 0.1% oxygen atmosphere for five hours. Plants in the control group were placed in cannisters that were left unsealed.	Root tissue was excised from plants and was flash frozen and ground in liquid nitrogen. Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 7 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, cRNA was hybridized to the ATH1 Arabidopsis Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip scanner 3000 7G.	The data was analysed using the limma Bioconductor package in R. Array data was normalized using the EXPRESSO function (Gautier et al., 2005). A robust multi-chip average was calculated using quantile normalization, background correction and the median polish method as recommended by (Bolstad et al., 2003) and (Irizarry et al., 2003).
