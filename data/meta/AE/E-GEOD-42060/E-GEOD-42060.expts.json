In this study, we characterized an Arabidopsis mutant, lib (low isoleucine biosynthesis), that has defects in both cell proliferation and cell expansion processes during root development. This mutant carries a mutation in OMR1 gene that encodes a threonine deaminase\/dehydratase (TD) which results in a defect in isoleucine production. Microarray analysis indicated that the partial deficiency of Ile in the lib mutant triggers a decrease in transcript levels of the genes encoding the major enzymes involved in the BCAA degradation pathway; the analysis also indicated that many genes involved in the biosynthesis of methionine-derived glucosinolates are up-regulated. Total RNAs were isolated from three replicate samples of the root tissues of 8-day-old wild type (w) and lib mutant (m)seedlings grown on 1\/2 MS medium and hybridized on Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays. The changes of gene expression in the lib mutant (m) was compared with the wild type (w). The corrected P value of <0.05 was used to select the genes for comparison, and only those genes whose expression was two-fold higher or lower in lib than in the WT were used for analysis."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Dong Liu","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Dong Liu","role":"submitter","email":"liu-d@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn"},{"contact":"Hailan Yu","role":null,"email":null}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"developmental stage","value":["8-day-old (after germination)"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia-0"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole seedling"]},{"category":"variation","value":["lib mutant","wild type"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"VARIATION","value":["lib mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":662331,"accession":"P-GSE42060-3"},{"id":662332,"accession":"P-GSE42060-2"},{"id":662326,"accession":"P-GSE42060-1"},{"id":662329,"accession":"P-GSE42060-7"},{"id":662330,"accession":"P-GSE42060-6"},{"id":662327,"accession":"P-GSE42060-5"},{"id":662328,"accession":"P-GSE42060-4"},{"id":662333,"accession":"P-GSE42060-8"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0}]}]}}
