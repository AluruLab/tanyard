Protocol Description	Seedlings were sawn on plates with 0.5x Murashige and Skoog basal salts, 1% sucrose, 0.8% agar and 100 ﾵg/ml timentin, stratified for 3 days and grown vertically at 22ﾺC under a 16h/8h light/dark regime for 5 days.<br>(Parameters: start time = 5, time unit = days, min temperature = 22, temperature unit = C, media = 0.5x Murashige and Skoog, 1% sucrose, 0.8% agar, 100ug/ml Timetin)	The lower third part of the pooled roots was collected and RNA extracted using the Quiagen RNAeasy kit according to manufacturerﾴs instruction for plant tissue.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Plates with seedlings were exposed to 37ﾺC for 40 min and allowed to recover for 1.5 h in normal growth conditions, then the seedlings were transferred to liquid culture medium supplemented with 10 ﾵM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid(NAA) or the equivalent amount of DMSO as control for 4 h.
