Experiment Description	The Arabidopsis cytochrome P450 KLUH (KLU)/CYP78A5 promotes organ growth in a non-cell autonomous manner. To identify genes regulated by KLU activity, homozygous klu-2 mutants carrying constructs for EtOH-inducible overexpression of wild-type KLU (35S::AlcR-AlcA::KLU) or of enzymatically inactive KLU protein (35S::AlcR-AlcA::KLUmut) were induced with EtOH and sampled at 90 min and 240 min after induction for gene expression changes. Experiment Overall Design: For both constructs (i.e. overexpression of wild-type and of mutant KLU protein as a control), two independently transformed lines were used, serving as biological replicates. These were sampled at 90 min and 240 min after induction. In addition, plants with the wild-type construct were also sampled immediately before induction as a control, together resulting in ten hybridizations.
