Plant material used for the experiments was pooled from 12 plants. Stage I and stage II samples contained complete flower buds (stage I) or flowers (stage II). For stage III samples only siliques without withering flower organs were harvested. About 10% of the tissues for each sample were cleared and analyzed by microscopy to ensure that homogenous developmental stages were harvested. The entire experiment was performed twice providing independent biological replicates."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Wilhelm Gruissem","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Lars Hennig","role":"submitter","email":"lhennig@ethz.ch"},{"contact":"Ueli Grossniklaus","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Claudia Kohler","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":15247381,"authors":"Lars Hennig; Wilhelm Gruissem; Ueli Grossniklaus; Claudia Kohler","title":"Transcriptional Programs of Early Reproductive","status":"published"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"BioSourceType","value":["frozen_sample"]},{"category":"DevelopmentalStage","value":["closed flower buds shortly before pollination","open pollinated flowers","siliques 2 days after pollination"]},{"category":"Ecotype","value":["Landsberg erecta"]},{"category":"Genotype","value":["wild_type"]},{"category":"Organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"OrganismPart","value":["flower","flower bud","silique"]},{"category":"provider","value":["ETH Zurich"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE","value":["closed flower buds shortly before pollination","open pollinated flowers","siliques 2 days after pollination"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":6,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":411742,"accession":"P-MEXP-23120"},{"id":30815,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v3"},{"id":88112,"accession":"P-MEXP-16111"},{"id":77,"accession":"P-AFFY-2"},{"id":51,"accession":"P-AFFY-6"},{"id":411741,"accession":"P-MEXP-23111"},{"id":63,"accession":"Affymetrix:Protocol:ExpressionStat"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"scan","bioassaydatacubes":6,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"scan","bioassays":6,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedDataMatrix","bioassaydatacubes":1,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedDataMatrix","bioassays":1,"isderived":1}]}]}}
