Experiment Description	Plants were grown in growth chambers at 70% humidity and daily cycles of 16 h light and 8 h darkness at 21 C. Plant material used for the experiments was pooled from 12 plants. Stage I and stage II samples contained complete flower buds (stage I) or flowers (stage II). For stage III samples only siliques without withering flower organs were harvested. About 10% of the tissues for each sample were cleared and analyzed by microscopy to ensure that homogenous developmental stages were harvested. The entire experiment was performed twice providing independent biological replicates.
