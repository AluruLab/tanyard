Protocol Description	Equal amounts of RNA from triplicate samples were pooled.	Following treatment, Arabidopsis plants were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80C. Total RNA was isolated from frozen Arabidopsis using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturerï¾’s instructions.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = genomic_DNA, Amplification = none)	Pro35S:ARR22:HA (line#11-7) transgenic plants were grown for 5 days under long-day conditions (16h light/8h dark) on 0.5x Murashige Skoog (MS) medium containing vitamins, 1.5% sucrose, 2.5 mM Mes, pH 5.7, and 0.8% agar., and then transferred to 0.5x MS agar plates containing 10 uM DEX, and grown for additional 5 days.<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)	Pro35S:ARR22:HA (line#11-7) transgenic plants were grown for 5 days under long-day conditions (16h light/8h dark) on 0.5x Murashige Skoog (MS) medium containing vitamins, 1.5% sucrose, 2.5 mM Mes, pH 5.7, and 0.8% agar, and then transferred to 0.5x MS agar plates and grown for additional 5 days.<br><br><br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)
