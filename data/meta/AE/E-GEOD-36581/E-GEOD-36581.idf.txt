Investigation Title	Expression data from 10-days old dark grown Arabidopsis seedlings of wild type (Col-0), sps1 line and L17 line.							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Expression data from 10-days old dark grown Arabidopsis seedlings of wild type (Col-0), sps1 line and L17 line.							
Experiment Description	In the present work, experiments were carried out to understand the molecular mechanism underlying phyA’ silencing.The EMS-mutagenesis of phyA’ line, L17, generated suppressor mutations that activate phyA’ locus. Detailed study of one suppressor line, sps1, indicated that methylation of specific CG site within the phyA coding region is critical for maintaining phyA’ silencing. In order to study the possible genomic targets of the putative SPS1 factor, microarray analysis using ATH1 genome array chip was done on sps1, L17 and Col-0. 9 samples in total were analyzed. Each line (WT, sps1, L17) were analyzed in triplicate.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = MAS 5.0 signal<br>ABS_CALL = <br>DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Following fragmentation, 5 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Tomato Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400. Hybridization reactions to Affymetrix Maize GeneChip expression arrays were done using the services of Expression Analysis Inc. (http://www.expressionanalysis.com/).	Arabidopsis seeds were germinated on Petri plates in dark and harvested after 10 days of cultivation.	Data extraction was also performed by Expression Analysis Inc. Expression values were calculated using the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System (GCOS) and were based on the difference of the PM (Perfect Match) signal and MM (Mismatch) signal at each of the probe pairs. The fluorescent signal values from each array were normalized to achieve similar overall intensity between arrays. The fluorescent signal values of any hybridization reaction were then multiplied by a scaling factor to make their (trimmed) mean intensity equal to 500. The scaling factor is unique to each hybridization reaction and is in general below 10	Scanning of the Affymetrix Tomato GeneChip expression arrays were done using the services of Expression Analysis Inc. (http://www.expressionanalysis.com/).	No special tretments before harvesting were carried out.	Total 10-days old dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The seedlings were then transferred to the laboratory and grinded to a fine powder in mortars and pestles using liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using a RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).	Complimentary RNA (cRNA) was produced according to Affymetrix IVT Express Kit as specified in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/expression_manual.affx).
