Protocol Description	The protoplasts were kept on ice during all isolation steps and centrifugation was conducted at 4 °C. Protoplasts of 200 ìl were mixed gently with 20 ìg RNA transcripts (TCV, HCRSV, TCV-HCP, HCRSV-TCP) and 200 ìl polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution (40 % PEG, 0.3 M mannitol, 100 mM CaCl2). Immediately after the mixing, 4.5 ml W5 solution was added to dilute the protoplasts. The protoplasts were kept on ice for 20 min before centrifugation at 100 x g for 3 min. Supernatant was discarded and the protoplasts were washed again. Protoplasts were incubated in protoplasts culture medium in a Petri-dish at a concentration of 1 X10 power of 5 at 25 °C in the dark for 16 and 48 hr respectively.	Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia 3 (Col-3) protoplasts was chosen for this study. The plants were grown under conditions of 12 h light/dark at 25 oC. Fully expanded leaves were harvested from 3-4 weeks old seedlings and surface sterilized for 10 min with 0.8 % Clorox® (sodium hypochloride), followed by 5 min washing with MilliRO® water for three times. The leaves were sliced into 1 mm strips and agitated in enzyme mixture slowly for 3 h at 25 °C in the dark to isolate the protoplasts. 	Total RNA was extracted from protoplasts at 16 h post transfection using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturers instructions.	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription.
