Protocol Description	Before experiment was started (4h after the beginning of light period), control plants were transferred back to the long-day conditions (air temperature of 21 C/18 C and light intensity of 150 uE). Treated plants were transferred to the same photoperiod with different light and/or temperatures regimes. All conditions were performed and sampled in parallel.	Normal temperature and high-light: Plants transferred to 21 C and hight-light intensity of 400 uE	Normal temperature and low-light: Plants transferred to 21 C and low-light intensity of 75 uE	Control treatment: long-day (16h) conditions (air temperature of 21 C/18 C and light intensity of 150 uE)	Low temperature and normal light: Plants transferred to 4 C and with light-intensity of 85 uE	Low temperature and darkness: Plants transferred to 4 C and no light	Hight temperature and normal light: Plants transferred 32 C and with light-intesity of 150 uE	Normal temperature and darkness: Plants transferred to 21 C and no light	High temperature and darkness: Plants transferred to 32 C and no light	Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 grown for 4 weeks in short-days (8h). Transfer to long-days (16h) with light/night temperatures of 21 C/18 C for 2 weeks.	All experimental conditions: harvests of 6 plant rosettes every 20min up to 360min. Additional sample taken at 5, 10, 640 and 1280min. Samples were harvested from individual plants and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from pools of 6 leaves	1 g of RNA was used as described in [Hannah et al. (2008) ,Global mRNA changes in microarray experiments,doi:10.1038/nbt0708-741]. Samples were hybridized to the Affymetrix ATH1 arrays and scanned by ATLAS Biolabs (Berlin, Germany).		Raw CEL files were analyzed using bioconductor. Quality control and Affymetrix MAS5 present/absent calls were obtained using affy package. GCRMA expression estimation was acquire using gcrma package. Intesity values are log2 transformed.
