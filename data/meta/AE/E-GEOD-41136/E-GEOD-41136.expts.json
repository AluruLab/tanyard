We sought to define the global gene network regulated through RAO2 function in response to mitochondrial stress (mimicked through treatment of plants with antimycin A - a specific inhibitor of complex III in the mitochondrial electron transfer chain), and non-specific stress signals such as hydrogen peroxide. We have defined global stress responses that are positively and negatively mediated by RAO2 function, and show that greater than 80% of transcripts that are differentially regulated under H2O2 stress require proper functioning of ANAC017 for a normal stress responses. We used Affymetrix microarray to characterise global gene expression profiles for mutant plants with compromised mitochondrial retrograde signalling (rao2 mutants), to define the genome wide transcriptional network regulated through RAO1 function under mitochondrial stress and hydrogen peroxide stress. rao2 EMS lines, independent T-DNA knock-out lines for ANAC017 (anac017-1), ANAC017 gain of function mutants (anac017-2) and wild type seedlings were grown for 14 days, the optimal stage as defined by forward genetic screens that identifed rao2 mutants. Seedlings were grown on GamborgB5 plates and treated by spraying plants with 50 ÂµM antimycin A (an elicitor of mitochondrial retrograde signalling) or 20mM hydrogen peroxide while mock control samples were sprayed with deionised water. Samples were collected after 3hr of treatment for global expression profiling."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Estelle Giraud","role":"submitter","email":"estelle.giraud@uwa.edu.au"},{"contact":"Estelle Giraud","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Sophia Ng","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":24045017,"authors":"Ng S, Ivanova A, Duncan O, Law SR, Van Aken O, De Clercq I, Wang Y, Carrie C, Xu L, Kmiec B, Walker H, Van Breusegem F, Whelan J, Giraud E.","title":"A membrane-bound NAC transcription factor, ANAC017, mediates mitochondrial retrograde signaling in Arabidopsis.","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.113.113985"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["14 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["anac017-1","anac017-2","rao2_EMS_mutant","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["leaf"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"compound","value":["antimycin A","hydrogen peroxide","water"]},{"name":"dose","value":["20 millimolar","50 micromolar"]},{"name":"genotype","value":["anac017-1","anac017-2","rao2_EMS_mutant","wild type"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":36,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1175327,"accession":"P-GSE41136-7"},{"id":1175326,"accession":"P-GSE41136-8"},{"id":1175329,"accession":"P-GSE41136-5"},{"id":1175328,"accession":"P-GSE41136-6"},{"id":1175330,"accession":"P-GSE41136-3"},{"id":1175332,"accession":"P-GSE41136-4"},{"id":1175325,"accession":"P-GSE41136-1"},{"id":1175331,"accession":"P-GSE41136-2"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":36,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":36,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":36,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":36,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":36,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":36,"isderived":0}]}]}}
