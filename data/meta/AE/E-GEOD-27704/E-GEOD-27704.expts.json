Inhibition of ALA synthesis results in decreased amounts of chlorophylls, heme, siroheme and phytochrome. It was previously shown that 4 out of 5 Arabidopsis mutants uncoupling nuclear gene expression from the physiological state of the chloroplast are affected in plant tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. It is common to all four mutants to show a reduced ALA formation. We investigate the impact of reduced plastidic ALA synthesis on nuclear gene expression by inhibition of ALA formation using gabaculin and compare these effects with  the gun4-1 mutant. Formation of 5-aminolevulinic acid was inhibited in Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 seedlings by application of 10 ÂµM gabaculin. Additionally the Arabidopsis gun4-1 mutant was investigated. Seedlings were etiolated for 3 days on MS medium in absence or presence of gabaculin and subsequently deetiolated for 6 hours. Total RNA was extracted and used for microarray hybridisation."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Olaf Czarnecki","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Bernhard Grimm","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Bernhard Grimm","role":"submitter","email":"bernhard.grimm@rz.hu-berlin.de"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["78 hour"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["gun4-1","wild type"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["whole organism"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["gun4-1","wild type"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["gabaculin","none"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":9,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1127602,"accession":"P-GSE27704-4"},{"id":1127599,"accession":"P-GSE27704-5"},{"id":1127600,"accession":"P-GSE27704-2"},{"id":1127601,"accession":"P-GSE27704-3"},{"id":1127596,"accession":"P-GSE27704-8"},{"id":1127598,"accession":"P-GSE27704-6"},{"id":1127597,"accession":"P-GSE27704-7"},{"id":1127595,"accession":"P-GSE27704-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":9,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":9,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":9,"isderived":0}]}]}}
