Experiment Description	"The experiment was designed to enable comparison between Columbia and ahk2/ahk3, ahk3/ahk4 double and ahk2/ahk3/ahk4 triple mutants Arabidopsis seedlings"

Protocol Description	"The Columbia (Col-0) ecotype of Arabidopsis thaliana was used as the wild type. ahk2/ahk3, ahk3/ahk4 double and ahk2/ahk3/ahk4 triple mutants were used as the mutant type. The plants (col-0 and ahk mutants) were grown for 12 days under long-day conditions (16h light/ 8h dark) on the 1/2 Murashige Skoog medium plate."	"Each RNA sample is obtanied from seedlings of Arabidopsis. The frozen plant tissue (~100 mg) was ground in tiny mortars dipped in liquid nitrogen. The frozen powder was carefully transfered into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes using small funnels and rubber spatulas also cooled with liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions and purified with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, 74104)."
