Investigation Title	Finding direct target genes of VND7							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Finding direct target genes of VND7							
Experiment Description	Direct target genes of VND7 were explored with inducible expression system using glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Transgenic plants expressing 35S:VND7-VP16-GR were treated with dexamethazone (DEX) and/or protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). A number of genes related to the formation of vascular vessel was induced by DEX even in the presence of CHX. Total RNAs of the transgenic plants expressing 35S:VND7-VP16-GR treated with DEX plus CHX and those treated with CHX only were compared.  As a control experiment, transgenic plants harboring empty vector were treated similarly and the total RNAs were compared similarly to identify genes merely induced by DEX treatment itself.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Ln value of MAS5.0 signal intensity divided by median value of all non-control probe sets.	Following fragmentation, 15 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	Seedlings were grown in MS agar medium in 16 hrs light at 23 centigrade degree.	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. All signals were divided by median value of all probe sets.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.	Ten-day-old seedlings grown on a medium were soaked with sterilized water containing 10 µM cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor, for 2 hours. After removal of the solution, the seedlings were soaked with sterilized water containing CHX and with or without 10 µM DEX for 4 hours.	Total RNA was extracted using Nucleospin RNA Plant System (Macherey-Nagel) following instruction.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA.
