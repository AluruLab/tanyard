Transgenic plants expressing 35S:VND7-VP16-GR were treated with dexamethazone (DEX) and\/or protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). A number of genes related to the formation of vascular vessel was induced by DEX even in the presence of CHX. Total RNAs of the transgenic plants expressing 35S:VND7-VP16-GR treated with DEX plus CHX and those treated with CHX only were compared.  As a control experiment, transgenic plants harboring empty vector were treated similarly and the total RNAs were compared similarly to identify genes merely induced by DEX treatment itself."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Misato Ohtani","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Masatoshi Yamaguchi","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Nobuitaka Mitsuda","role":"submitter","email":"nobutaka.mitsuda@aist.go.jp"},{"contact":"Nobutaka Mitsuda","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Taku Demura","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":21284754,"authors":"Yamaguchi M, Mitsuda N, Ohtani M, Ohme-Takagi M, Kato K, Demura T","title":"VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN7 directly regulates the expression of a broad range of genes for xylem vessel formation"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["10 day"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Col-0"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["control","transgenic 35S:VND-VP16-GR"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["seedling"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"genotype","value":["control","transgenic 35S:VND-VP16-GR"]},{"name":"growth condition","value":["10mM cycloheximide (CHX) 2hrs and 10mM dexamethazone (DEX) 4hrs","10mM cycloheximide (CHX) 6hrs"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":20,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1138489,"accession":"P-GSE24169-3"},{"id":1138484,"accession":"P-GSE24169-7"},{"id":1138486,"accession":"P-GSE24169-6"},{"id":1138490,"accession":"P-GSE24169-2"},{"id":1138487,"accession":"P-GSE24169-5"},{"id":1138485,"accession":"P-GSE24169-8"},{"id":1138488,"accession":"P-GSE24169-4"},{"id":1138483,"accession":"P-GSE24169-1"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":20,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":20,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":20,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":20,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":20,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":20,"isderived":0}]}]}}
