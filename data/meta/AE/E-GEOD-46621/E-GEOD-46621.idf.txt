Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	RNA-seq of Arabidopsis seedlings with or without light pulses treatment in the middle of day or night against untreated controls to study how the light pulses control the phase of the circadian clock						
Experiment Description	Light pulses at the end of the day or night be able to control the phase of the circadian clock. Pulses in the middle of the night has not effect on the circadian oscilations. To understand how the circadian clock gate the light signal in the middle of the night we used microarrays to characterize the light effect in the whole expression profile. Plants of Arabidopsis thalina (Columbia ecotype) were grown in 12/12 light/dark cicles for 15 days and then were tranfer to continuous dark . Plants were slplit in two groups. First group recieved 1hr light pulse in the middle of the night (Night treatment), second group recieve 1hr light pulse in the middle of the subjective day (Day Treatment). Samples of both groups were collected without light pulse named as a control.

Protocol Description	The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100. ID_REF =  VALUE = MAS5.0 signal intensity DETECTION P-VALUE = 	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 ug total RNA (Analysis Technical Manual, 2005, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 15 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on Arabidopsis Genome ATH1 Array were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	1hr white light pulse during middle of the night (CT=6) or middle of the subjective day (CT=18). Control samples were collected without light pulse treatment.	15 days old plant were grown in 12/12 white light/dark cycles and then were transfered to countinuos dark free running conditions.	Total RNA extraction was performed using RNaeasy Mini kit system according to the manufacturer's instructions.	GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix Scanner 3000 7G
