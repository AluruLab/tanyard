Pulses in the middle of the night has not effect on the circadian oscilations. To understand how the circadian clock gate the light signal in the middle of the night we used microarrays to characterize the light effect in the whole expression profile. Plants of Arabidopsis thalina (Columbia ecotype) were grown in 12\/12 light\/dark cicles for 15 days and then were tranfer to continuous dark . Plants were slplit in two groups. First group recieved 1hr light pulse in the middle of the night (Night treatment), second group recieve 1hr light pulse in the middle of the subjective day (Day Treatment). Samples of both groups were collected without light pulse named as a control."}],"provider":[{"contact":"Marcelo Yanovsky","role":"submitter","email":"myanovsky@leloir.org.ar"},{"contact":"Matias Rugnone","role":null,"email":null},{"contact":"Marcelo Yanovsky","role":null,"email":null}],"bibliography":[{"accession":23818596,"authors":"Rugnone ML, Faigón Soverna A, Sanchez SE, Schlaen RG, Hernando CE, Seymour DK, Mancini E, Chernomoretz A, Weigel D, Más P, Yanovsky MJ","title":"LNK genes integrate light and clock signaling networks at the core of the Arabidopsis oscillator.","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1302170110"}],"samplecharacteristic":[{"category":"age","value":["15 day"]},{"category":"developmental stage","value":["seedling"]},{"category":"ecotype","value":["Columbia"]},{"category":"genotype","value":["wild type genotype"]},{"category":"organism","value":["Arabidopsis thaliana"]},{"category":"organism part","value":["aerial rosette"]}],"experimentalvariable":[{"name":"growth condition","value":["1 hour white light pulse in the middle of the night","1 hour white light pulse in the middle of the subjective day","day time control (without light pulse)","night time control (without light pulse)"]}],"arraydesign":[{"id":10922,"accession":"A-AFFY-2","name":"Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome [ATH1-121501]","count":12,"legacy_id":13851999}],"protocol":[{"id":1130990,"accession":"P-GSE46621-4"},{"id":1130991,"accession":"P-GSE46621-3"},{"id":1130992,"accession":"P-GSE46621-2"},{"id":1130986,"accession":"P-GSE46621-1"},{"id":1130989,"accession":"P-GSE46621-5"},{"id":1130988,"accession":"P-GSE46621-6"},{"id":1130987,"accession":"P-GSE46621-7"}],"bioassaydatagroup":[{"id":null,"name":"rawData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"rawData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"normalization","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"normalization","bioassays":12,"isderived":0},{"id":null,"name":"processedData","bioassaydatacubes":12,"arraydesignprovider":null,"dataformat":"processedData","bioassays":12,"isderived":0}]}]}}
