Investigation Title	A combinatorial Interplay Among the ACC Synthase Isoforms Regulates Ethylene Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana						
Comment[Submitted Name]	A combinatorial Interplay Among the ACC Synthase Isoforms Regulates Ethylene Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana
Experiment Description	ACC Synthase (ACS) is the key regulatory enzyme in the ethylene biosynthesis in plants. It catalyzes the conversion of s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), the precursor of ethylene. Arabidopsis has nine ACS genes. The goal of the project is to inactivate each gene by insertional mutagenesis and amiRNA technology and eventually construct a null ACS mutant. We have been recently able to achieve this goal. Furthermore, we wanted to know how inactivation of individual ACS genes affects global gene expression.  Keywords: ACS mutant comprrison; global gene expression. Triplicate samples of 10-day light grown seedling from each ACS mutant was used for microarray analysis.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = Expression estimated by RMA	GeneChips were scanned with the default settings using the GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G.	10 microgram of cRNA were hybridized to the GeneChip® Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array chip according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. GeneChips were scanned with the default settings using the > GeneChip® Scanner 3000 7G.	Total RNA was prepared using RNAqueous RNA isolation kit with Plant RNA isolation aid (Ambion, Austin, TX). After LiCl precipitation, RNA was purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and re-precipitated with LiCl. RNA pellets were washed with 70% EtOH (three times), and resuspended in DEPC-treated water.	Seeds were surface sterilized for 8min in 5% sodium hypochlorite, 0.15% Tween 20, excessively rinsed in distilled water, and germinated on MS medium (0.8% Select Agar (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD), 0.5X Murashige-Skoog (MS) salts (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.5mM MES, pH5.7, 1% sucrose, 1X B5 vitamins. After cold treatment at 4 ï‚°C for 2 days, the plates were incubated at 25 ï‚°C under 16h light / 8h for 10 days.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA	RMA
