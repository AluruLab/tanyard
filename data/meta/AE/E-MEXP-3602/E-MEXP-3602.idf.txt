Comment[MIAMExpressSubmissionID]	8212		
Experiment Description	Plants of Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col-0, nrb4-2 and nrb4-4) were grown in phytochambers in short day conditions during three weeks. Then, samples from different pots were mixed, and the RNA extracted.

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-26173	P-MTAB-26175	P-MTAB-26176
Protocol Description	The normalization was done with the package &quot;affy&quot; of &quot;R&quot;. The function used was &quot;rma(Data)&quot;.	Total RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturerﾒs recommendation. Following extraction, an additional step of column purification with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was added to ensure the purity of the RNA.  <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Plants of Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Col-0.<br><br>Seeds were sowed in soil and kept at 4 C for 2 days (stratification).<br><br>After stratification, the pots are transferred to growth conditions, in a walk-in chamber.<br><br>The conditions of grow are:<br><br>Light from 10 am to 6 pm, at 21 C<br><br>Dark from 6 pm to 10 am, at 19 C.<br><br>No humidity control.<br><br><br><br><br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)
