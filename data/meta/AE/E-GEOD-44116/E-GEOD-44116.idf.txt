Investigation Title	Cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly-deficient mutant, nar1 and nbp35 mutant seedling						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly-deficient mutant, nar1 and nbp35 mutant seedling
Experiment Description	Expression profiling of two-weeks-old wild type, nar1-4/- and nbp35-3/-  mutant seedlings. The cytosolic Fe -S cluster assembly pathway is involved in cytosolic and nucleus Fe-S protein maturation. The nar1 mutant was identified by the screeing for abnormal transcription feature in endosperm.We performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of weak allele nar1-4/- using microarrays to estimate whether the  cytosolic Fe -S cluster assembly could affect on the transcriptional profile even in vegetative tissues. Two biological replicate were performed using two weeks seedling of wild type, nar1-4/- and nbp35-3/-. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit(QIAGEN).

Protocol Description	RMA processing using R/Bioconductor ID_REF =  VALUE = log2 signal by RMA processing	Biotinylated cRNA were synthesized by GeneChip 3'IVT Express Kit （Affymetrix) from 250 ng (200 ng for sample '2EA1021_10', '4EA1021_11', '6EA1021_12') total RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer.	Following fragmentation, 10 ug (5 ug for sample '2EA1021_10', '4EA1021_11', '6EA1021_12') of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45 degrees on GeneChip Arabidpsis ATH1 Gemome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.	2-week-old whole plants were collected and frozen by liquid nitrogen.	Plants were grown on MS plates for 2 weeks under 16 h light/8 h dark at 22˚C.	Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	GeneChips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.
