Investigation Title	Arabidopsis thaliana mutant leaves treated with Pseudomonas syringae ES4326							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Arabidopsis thaliana mutant leaves treated with Pseudomonas syringae ES4326							
Experiment Description	In order to better understand the transcriptional networks triggered by pathogen inoculation, we monitored gene expression in leaves of mutant Arabidopsis plants, inoculated with Pseudomonas syringae ES4326 and wild type Col-0 plants grown in parallel.  Individual leaves were injected in the morning using a needle-less syringe with 10E5 cfu cm-2 PsmES4326 (suspended in 5 mM MgSO4).  For the wild type, leaves were also mock treated with 5 mM MgSO4.  Leaves were harvested 24 hours later.  Plants were grown in pots with BM-2 soil (Berger Peat Moss Ltd, Quebec, Canada) at a density of 9 plants per pot and kept at 22 degrees Celsius with 75% humidity and a 12 hour day length.  Keywords: Expression profiling by array 24 samples were used in this experiment

Biotin Labelled cRNA using &quot;Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit&quot;, according to guidelines set out by Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA	Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol	Plants grown in BM-2 soil at 22 degrees celsius with 75% humidity and 12hr day length	Seeds were planted in BM-2 soil (Berger's) at a density of 9 plants/pot. Flats of 8 pots/flat were placed in a growth chamber and grown at 22 degrees celsius, 75% humidity for a 12 hour day length	Labelled using protocol described in Affymetrix manual &quot;3' IVT Express Kit User Manual&quot;	Raw data from the microarrays was normalized at probe-level using MAS5 algorithm. The detection calls (present, marginal, absent) for each probe set was obtained using the GCOS system
