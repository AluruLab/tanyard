Individual leaves were injected in the morning using a needle-less syringe with 10E5 cfu cm-2 PsmES4326 (suspended in 5 mM MgSO4).  For the wild type, leaves were also mock treated with 5 mM MgSO4.  Leaves were harvested 24 hours later.  Plants were grown in pots with BM-2 soil (Berger Peat Moss Ltd, Quebec, Canada) at a density of 9 plants per pot and kept at 22 degrees Celsius with 75% humidity and a 12 hour day length.
