Comment[AEExperimentDisplayName]	Identify differentially expressed genes in 14-day-old pkl seedlings							
Experiment Description	"CHD3 proteins are ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors that are components of diverse multisubunit complexes that can either repress or activate gene expression. In plants, the CHD3 protein PICKLE (PKL) is necessary for repression of seed-specific genes during germination and promotes deposition of the repressive epigenetic mark trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). It is unknown, however, if PKL acts directly at H3K27me3-enriched loci.  We undertook a microarray analysis of 14-day-old plants and found that PKL continues to play an important role in expression of H3K27me3-enriched genes and in specification of developmental identity after germination. We used microarray to identify genes that are differentialy expressed in 14-day-old pkl seedlings and used chormatin immunoprecipitation to identify genes that are the direct targets of PKL. Wild-type (Col-0) and pkl-1 seedlings were grown on 1/2 MS plates with constant light and harvsted after 14-day growth. Three biological replicates."
