In plants, the CHD3 protein PICKLE (PKL) is necessary for repression of seed-specific genes during germination and promotes deposition of the repressive epigenetic mark trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). It is unknown, however, if PKL acts directly at H3K27me3-enriched loci.  We undertook a microarray analysis of 14-day-old plants and found that PKL continues to play an important role in expression of H3K27me3-enriched genes and in specification of developmental identity after germination. We used microarray to identify genes that are differentialy expressed in 14-day-old pkl seedlings and used chormatin immunoprecipitation to identify genes that are the direct targets of PKL. Wild-type (Col-0) and pkl-1 seedlings were grown on 1\/2 MS plates with constant light and harvsted after 14-day growth.
