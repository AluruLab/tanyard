Experiment Description	We used Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 GeneChip to profile RNAs active in wild type columbia (glabrous) and CaMV::DME pollen and stamens. Experiment Overall Design: DME is not active in wild type pollen and stamen.  DME was induced in pollen and stamen by a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (CaMV).  RNA profiles from wild type and CaMV::DME pollen and stamens were compared using Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip.					
Protocol Name	P-G9408-1	P-G9408-3	P-G9408-2	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown	P-AFFY-6	
Protocol Type	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	
Protocol Description	Plants were grown in standard green house conditions using a 16:8 light-dark cycle.	Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and poly(A)+ RNA was selected using Dynabeads mRNA Purification kit (Dynal Inc) according to the manufacturers.	Fifteen micrograms of total RNA was poly(A)+ selected using Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Dynal Inc.).  Double-stranded cDNAs were generated using Superscript Choice System (Invitrogen).  Biotinylated cRNAs were synthesized with the ENZO BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo Life Sciences).	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization.
