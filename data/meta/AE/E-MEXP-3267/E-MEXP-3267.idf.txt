Experiment Description	Aim of the experiment is the identification of genes differentially regulated in phyA seedlings relative to wild type after prolonged exposure to low R/FR. To this end, gene expression changes were analysed in Arabidopsis wild-type and phyA knock-out mutant seedlings exposed to low R/FR light. The experiment was designed to enable comparison between the different genotypes exposed or not exposed to low R/FR light.

Protocol Description	15 µg of cRNA was used in a 300 µl hybridization containing added hybridization controls. 200 µl of mixture was hybridized on arrays for 16 h at 45°C. Standard post hybridization wash and double-stain protocols (EukGE-WS2v4) were used on an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 400.<br>(Parameters: Chamber type = Affymetrix- GeneChip Hyb Oven 640, Quantity of label target used = 15, Mass unit = Micro gram, time = 16, Tiny time unit = hours, Volume = 200, Volume unit = Micro litre, temperature = 45)	RNAs from two biological replicates were used to prepare hybridization probes according to Affymetrix one-cycle protocol. 5 µg of total RNA was used in a reverse transcription reaction (SuperScript II; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) to generate first-strand cDNA. After second-strand synthesis, double-strand cDNA was used in an in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction to generate biotinylated cRNA (ENZO BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit; ENZO Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). Size distribution of the cRNA and fragmented cRNA, respectively, was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with a RNA 6000 Nano Assay.<br>(Parameters: Amount of nucleic acid labeled = 5, Label used = biotin, Amplification = none, Mass unit = Micro gram)	Seedlings were grown in a growth chamber (E30-LED, Percival Scientific Inc., USA), at 21°C temperature, 75% humidity, 16 h light/8 h dark cycles.<br>(Parameters: start time = 8, time unit = days, min temperature = 21, temperature unit = C)	Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Each sample consists of a pool of 200 individuals. Two sets of samples were collected from independent experiments.<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Arabidopsis seedlings were exposed to high R/FR light and then to low R/FR light for a period of time. Light outputs in high R/FR were: 670 nm (Red) 96 mmoles m-2s-1; 735 nm (Far Red) 21 mmoles m-2s-1; 470 nm (Blue) 15 mmoles m-2s-1. Light outputs in low R/FR were: 670 nm, 12 mmoles m-2s-1; 735 nm, 105 mmoles m-2s-1; 470 nm, 15 mmoles m-2s-1. 7-day-old wild-type and phyA seedlings were either maintained in high R/FR or transferred to low R/FR for 1 day, and then harvested.
