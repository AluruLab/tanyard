Experiment Description	 Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that is important in responding to various environmental stresses. Using an ABA auxotroph in Arabidopsis (aba2-2) as the plant material, we would like to identify early downstream targets of transcription in response to a small dose of ABA, 1 uM. We also added cycloheximide to preferentially obtain immediate targets of ABA addition. We believe that using a sensitized background of an ABA auxotroph would yield a set of genes that are very closely regulated by ABA at the transcriptional level. This data set will be used for network analysis of ABA signaling.

Protocol Description	Seeds were sterilized by vigorously shaking in 800 uL of 20% bleach (7:3) for 5 minutes and rinsed 5X in sterilized water. Seeds were sown on 0.5X MS 0.8% agar media plates and stratified for 4 days at 4C. After four days, the plates were transferred to room temperature under constant light. After 11 days, seedlings were transferred to a 0.5X MS 0.8% agar media plate containing either 10 uM cycloheximide or 10 uM cycloheximide and 1 uM ABA for 6 hours. After 6 hours, seedlings grown in both conditions were harvested from which RNA was extracted.<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C, media = 1/2 X MS)	After 11 days of growth at room temperature and constant light, seedlings were transferred to a 0.5X MS 0.8% agar media plate containing either 10 uM cycloheximide or 10 uM cycloheximide and 1 uM ABA for 6 hours.	Eleven-day old seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted by a Trizol-based method.  <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	The top 2% and bottom 2% of signal intensities are excluded, then the mean is calculated. The original signal values  are scaled such that the mean (TGT value) is made equal to 500	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis.
