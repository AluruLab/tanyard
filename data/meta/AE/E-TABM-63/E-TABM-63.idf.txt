Protocol Description	Plants were grown on soil under continuous light at 23 C and 65% relative humidity	Plants were grown on 1/2 MS agar plates without sucrose for 7 days in a growth chamber under continuous light	About 100 inflorescences with oldest flowers around stage 10 were pooled and split into two replicates. All plants were grown at the same time.	80 to 120 seedlings grown for 7d on agar plate in a growth chamber were pooled and split into two replicate. All plants were grown at the same time.	Affymetrix Probe Synthesis Guidelines AtGenExpress<br> <br> Markus Schmid and Jan Lohmann Department of Molecular Biology Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology Spemannstrasse 37-39, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany The following protocol was used for all samples contained in the developmental series of AtGenExpress (Tubingen set). The protocol is streamlined for larger sample numbers. It is imperative that you familiarize yourself with the original protocols provided by Affymetrix and by the suppliers of the individual kits before starting probe preparation.<br> <br> RNA isolation from whole plants and seedlings<br> <br> Use of "Plant-RNeasy Mini Kit" (QIAGEN) to isolate total RNA is recommended. Make sure you use sterile and nuclease-free glassware or plastic. Before first use, READ THE MANUAL!!!
