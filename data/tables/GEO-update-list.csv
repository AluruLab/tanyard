But how grapevine responds to cold stress is still largely unknown. Here we found that VaMyb14, a member of R2R3 Myb transcription factor family, was up-regulated dramatically during cold, drought and salinity treatments in Vitis amurensis, a cold and drought-hardiness wild Vitis species. Overexpression VaMyb14 in Arabidopsis increased antioxidant enzyme activity, especially POD activity, than that of the wild type and decreased the MDA content. A series of ABA metabolism and signal transduction genes in transgenic Arabidopsiswere were up-regulated in microarry results, including several nsLTPs, PP2Cs, RD29B, COR78 and other structural genes, suggesting that VaMyb14 not only affect the ABA signaling pathways, but also activates the CBF-COR independent nsLTP genes. Collectively, these results illustrate that Vitis Myb14 could represent a node of convergence regulating grapevine stress responses, including improve defence induced phytoalexin resveratrol against necrotrophic as well as drought and/or cold stress tolerance, highlighting Myb14 as a potential gene resource in future grapevine breeding.",2018-03-27,2018-06-01,Public on Jun 01 2018,"Leaves from wild-type and three transgenic lines were collected before and after 8 h cold stress.

Analyzing the gene profile of root apex in diverse environments is important and challenging, especially when the samples are limiting and precious, such as in spaceflight. The feasibility of using tiny root sections for transcriptome analysis was examined in this study.To understand the gene expression profiles of the root apex, Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 roots were sectioned into Zone-I (0.5 mm, root cap and meristematic zone) and Zone-II (1.5 mm, transition, elongation and growth terminating zone). Gene expression was analyzed using microarray and RNA seq.Both the techniques, arrays and RNA-Seq identified 4180 common genes as differentially expressed (with > two-fold changes) between the zones. In addition, 771 unique genes and 19 novel TARs were identified by RNA-Seq as differentially expressed which were not detected in the arrays.;	Single root tip zones can be used for full transcriptome analysis; further, the root apex zones are functionally very distinct from each other. RNA-Seq provided novel information about the transcripts compared to the arrays.

Although elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of callus formation and shoot regeneration has helped advance plant biotechnology research, many plant species are intractable to transformation because of difficulties with callus regulation. In this study, we identified the compound Fipexide (FPX) as a useful regulatory compound through chemical biology-based screening. Compared with the activity of auxin and cytokinin, FPX showed higher efficiency as a chemical inducer in callus formation, shoot regeneration, and Agrobacterium infection. In regards to morphology, the cellular organization of FPX-induced callus differed from that produced under auxin/cytokinin conditions. According to a microarray analysis, the expressions of approximately 971 genes were two-fold up-regulated by FPX treatment for 2 days. Among these genes, 598 genes were also induced by auxin/cytokinin, while 373 genes, including metabolic regulation-related genes, were specifically expressed only under FPX treatment. FPX can promote callus formations in rice, poplar, and several vegetables. FPX should be a useful tool to reveal unknown mechanisms of plant development and to increase the number of transgenic plant species.",2018-07-11,2018-07-12,Public on Jul 12 2018,"Total RNAs of the 4-d-old wild-type seedlings treated with 45 μM FPX for 0, 2, and 8 days.

158,GSE116938,FPX is a Novel Chemical Inducer That Promotes Callus Formation and Shoot Regeneration in Plants [FPX],Expression profiling by array,"Auxin and cytokinin can regulate callus formation from developed plant organs and shoot regeneration from callus. The regulation of dedifferentiation and regeneration of plant cells by auxin and cytokinin stimulation was considered to be caused by the regulation of reprograming of callus cells, but the hypothesis had been argued still in now. Although elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of callus formation and shoot regeneration has helped advance plant biotechnology research, many plant species are intractable to transformation because of difficulties with callus regulation.
